1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tokyo, Japan

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's been a while

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's been a while

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We've been to Okinawa

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To the southern island

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tokyo is...

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Not Tokyo, but Japan was tough

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What was tough?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The typhoon

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was tough, wasn't it?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Listen to yourself

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It was really tough

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But Osaka was tough, wasn't it?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Osaka was tough

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Osaka was tough

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The typhoon was so strong that I almost fainted

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's rare in Osaka

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I had to go out

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I had to go out

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why did you have to go out when it was raining and windy?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was going to send this

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That was a lie

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's fine

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's fine

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It was so windy

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you call that?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was so windy

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Just like that

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It was so windy

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just like what you said

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Look

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It was so windy

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It was so windy

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It was so windy

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was so windy

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When did you prepare it?

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It was so windy

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It was so windy

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was so windy

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It was so windy

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's winter today

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm wearing winter clothes

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm wearing all the summer clothes

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop it

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What is it?

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was so windy

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was so windy

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There were about three typhoons today

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There were

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Was it really a typhoon?

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My mother also said it was a typhoon

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Was it really a typhoon?

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You have to say it

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It was really a typhoon

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't want to hear it

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For today's opening

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We went to the preliminary round

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We went to the preliminary round

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's eat

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Here you go

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm wearing the same shoes as last time

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Please turn to your right

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There are three places

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Please take care of it

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank you

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You should have taken care of it

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are a regular

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is the second time

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm still nervous

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think it's better to start from here

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm a professional when I put makeup on my face

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So it doesn't matter if I put a mole here

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It doesn't matter

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't have that much time

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Excuse me

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sen Masao

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't have that much time

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's totally different

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It doesn't look like Kin-chan

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But it looks like Kin-chan

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't hide it

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't hide it

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It looks like Kin-chan

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Next is No.155

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm glad

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll give you a score

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I did my best

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Please give me a score

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you doing it by yourself?

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm doing it by myself

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Please give me a score

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You are so cute

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please give me a score

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Just a little more

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I did it

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Did you do it by yourself?

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You did it by yourself

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Please give me a score

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I did it by myself

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I did it by myself

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I brought this by myself

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are so cute

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Please give me a score

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Please give me a score

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't win

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't lower it

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Please give me a score

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I got it

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I did my best

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I got 100% of my power

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's have an interview

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is the best

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are so cute

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Please give me a score

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I did it

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are so cute

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hello

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hello

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hello

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hello

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Thank you for the interview

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thank you

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is the result of the screening

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I see

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I know you are watching

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Where are you going?

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Where are you going?

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Tell me

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Where are you going?

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I want to ask you

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Where are you going?

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I see

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What?

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where are you going?

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What is the result of the screening?

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will tell you

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We passed the screening

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Really?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Are you kidding me?

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Really?

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We did it

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank you

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We passed the screening

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thank you

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He was kind

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He didn't say that before

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, he was kind

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I thought I could do it

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's hear from Momoya

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's 3 o'clock

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What are you talking about?

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's go

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We will continue next week

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But the screening is already decided

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We have to go forward

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are we going to do next?

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We have to think about the next step

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The staff is moving

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you going to do something else?

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is it?

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's a word

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are you going to do it?

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a word

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We are going to rent the Tokyo Dome

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We talked about it

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, we didn't

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If we rent the Tokyo Dome

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
40 million yen

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Give it to me

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Give it to Mr.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Give me 100 yen

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
40 million yen

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is amazing

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's cheap if we rent the Tokyo Dome

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's noisy

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
40 million yen for the event

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
40 million yen

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If we don't return it, we will be fined

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's not a rental video

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We have to return it

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you talking about?

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is impossible

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
40 million yen

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We don't have that kind of money

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We don't have money

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We have to pay for the whole set

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We have to ask people to come

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
How many people?

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We have to ask a lot of people

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So we have to ask 1000 people

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
1000 people with long beards and kimono

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
1000 people

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We are talking about 1000 people

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
These guys are crazy

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I laughed for 10 minutes

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can't do that?

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can't

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I laughed about insects

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Ants?

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Ants

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You call them ants?

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you stupid?

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ants?

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ants?

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You are crazy

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You are crazy

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So what?

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
1000 people

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
1000 people

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
1000 people is 1000 people

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
These guys are crazy

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
1000 people

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
1000 people is 1000 people

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
1000 people

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't talk about politics with you

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How many people?

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
More than 1000 people

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
More than 1000 people

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We need more than 1000 people

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
1000 people is not enough

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why not?

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It depends on what we do

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I see

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We have to ask people to come

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We have to ask people to come

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We have to ask people to come

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We had a meeting with them

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We had a meeting with them

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I hope they come

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
These guys are not cooperative

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They are not cooperative

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They may be ignored

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
For example, 150 people are here

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If we don't do anything, I will go

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Half of 150 people are here

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This program has 39% of viewers

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Really?

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It can't be

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's midnight

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have 39% of viewers at midnight

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The next day you have to go to work

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What are you talking about?

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think 5000 people will come

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It will be great if 5000 people come

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think they will come

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Really?

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They will come

281
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It depends on the place

282
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It depends on the place

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's decide the place

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Dome is out

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Dome is out

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Where is the wide place?

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In Tokyo

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Around here

290
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Edogawa?

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Where is Edogawa?

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Is there a place like Kasenjiki?

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Is there a place like Kinpachi sensei's walking?

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is there a place like that?

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There are thousands of places like that

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is there a place like that?

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Really?

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know the wide place

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is there a place like Kinpachi sensei's walking?

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's complicated from the top

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Everyone is dressed up like Kinpachi

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's go to Hagaki

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hello

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
My father is big

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Your father is big

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't say that

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Really

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can say it twice

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's introduce

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yano Yumiko

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He was born in 1946

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He is 8 years old

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
19 years old

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
19 years old

316
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you live in Shinjuku?

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was born and raised in Shinjuku

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That means you are from Hakata

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm from Katakare

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Who are you talking to?

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm talking to my mother

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I've been talking to you for a long time

323
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm good at English

324
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You are not good at English

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you kidding me?

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't talk to me like that

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why don't you talk to me?

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Like this

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You are cute

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's introduce

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hama-chan used to have a surgery in a hospital in Kansai

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The nurse who came to get her signature was my sister

334
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's embarrassing when you get sick

335
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was there for a week

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
When I had a fever

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I had to put a medicine in my butt

338
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I put it in a lot

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't understand

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't understand, it's here

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't understand, it's here

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know where it is

343
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you touch it with your finger, it's here

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I couldn't put it in

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The nurse came and I did it

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's my job

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I couldn't put it in

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I pushed it back

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why?

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why did you push it back?

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why? I'm weird

352
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Really?

353
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You have a lot of acupoints

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I have a lot of acupoints

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The acupoints were bent

357
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I had to put it back

358
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It was like a vending machine

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The acupoints were bent

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't like it when I can't look at my butt

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But if you have acupoints, you can put it back

362
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I've never had that

363
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I've never had that

364
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I've never had that

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like a nuisance

366
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Men get excited

367
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
One of my friends went there

368
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He got really excited

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He was like an old lady

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He was like an old lady

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He was like an old lady

372
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He got really excited

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Young nurses get shy

374
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But old ladies get used to it

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I've been doing it for decades

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What do you think?

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He got really excited

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The old lady went like this

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's true

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Really?

381
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Like this

382
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Men get excited

383
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Kimura Satoko from Nakano

384
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
She's 23 years old

385
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Please introduce your boyfriend to me

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Is there anyone in the staff?

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm waiting for a call

388
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Kimura Satoko, please send her a photo

389
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes

390
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Send her a photo

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Send her a photo

392
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Send it to my staff

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For the one who's going to do the interview

394
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Put them in the opening

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You can ask the person

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You can ask the person

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Put them all together

398
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll be in the photo

399
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll be in the photo

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why are you in the photo?

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You know

402
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Japan is a multi-labeled country

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
God only gives to one woman

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
God only gives to one woman

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
When I went to Alta on the 5th of September

407
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hama-chan was nice

408
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Matsumoto-san was not

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But it was the other way around

410
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The first time I went was last August

411
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I was waiting next to the grape tree

412
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When Hama-san came

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We were glared at

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We were really scared

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The next Matsumoto-san's friend said

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Excuse me

417
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He raised his head

418
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He didn't glare at me at all

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Matsumoto-san and Hama-san

420
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Which one is kind and which one is scary?

421
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Please do your best

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There's a technique like this

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm not glaring at you

424
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're glaring at me

425
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm not

426
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
In the past

427
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Your bad habit

428
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're glaring at me

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In the past

430
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
When we were doing Kinden

431
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In the last episode of Kinden

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Taisho

433
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Kin-chan

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He read everyone

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And pointed out your bad habit

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Matsumoto-san was perfect

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He didn't say anything

438
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Stop it

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Really?

440
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you

441
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hama-san

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're glaring at me

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's not good

444
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You shouldn't do that

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're still like this

446
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is that so?

447
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Taisho

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He's a man who got beaten up

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't say bad things about me

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You're always glaring at me

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why did you say sorry?

452
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't understand

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I didn't say anything

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He didn't talk to me

455
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's fine

456
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Other people are not that kind

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Other than us?

458
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes

459
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Like you?

460
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They're not that kind

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If they're not that kind

462
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We shouldn't think about it

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Right

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Can you do it?

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What?

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't do scary things

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But you say I'm scary

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What can I do?

469
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I told you before

470
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're always glaring at me

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I can't see

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But you come to me

473
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And ask me to sign

474
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I sign

475
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What?

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That means you don't do scary things

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There are times when I do

478
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Listen to me

479
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I ask you to sign

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And you sign

481
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want you to write your name

482
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What's your name?

483
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Nani

484
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I have an exam

485
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Good luck with your exam

486
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Are you kidding me?

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I won't sign

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm serious

489
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Good luck with your exam

490
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You're so lame

491
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey

492
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Hi

493
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Excuse me

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I want you to take a picture

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Sure

496
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't do that

497
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll do this

498
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Can you take my sunglasses?

499
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Sure

500
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll take it

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I want you to make a peace

502
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I won't do it

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I won't do it

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll do it

505
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Thank you

506
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There are people who say I'm scary

507
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I can't stand it

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You've gone that far

509
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There are people who say I'm scary

510
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What?

511
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is new

512
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I've never seen anyone do that

513
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You've gone that far

514
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll do it

515
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I won't do it

516
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll do it

517
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll do it

518
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll do it

519
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll do it

520
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll do it

521
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll do it

522
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'll do it

523
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll do it

524
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll do it

525
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll do it

526
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hey

527
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hey

528
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Feel free to make your choice

529
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm not afraid of it

530
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll do it

531
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll do it

532
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll do it

533
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'll do it

534
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll do it

535
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll do it

536
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll do it

537
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're so lame

538
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What?

539
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What?

540
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What?

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You've gone that far

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Spare my life

543
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll do it

544
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'll do it

545
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll do it

546
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'll do it

547
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll do it

548
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'd appreciate it if you could do that.

549
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know how many of you there are, but I'd like to do it.

550
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah, but it depends on the number of people.

551
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's better to decide what to do after you know the number of people.

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's right.

553
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So I'd like to do it.

554
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Please do it.

555
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let's do it together.

556
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, and the costume.

557
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Next week, the continuation of the costume will be released.

558
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

559
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The main story is out.

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This is interesting.

561
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's more interesting than the costume of the main story.

562
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No, I'm serious.

563
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If you don't watch it next week, the continuation of the costume will be released next week.

564
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'll do my best.

566
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll do my best next week.

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Goodbye.

568
