1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'll tell you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're watching TV, right?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Even if you buy it from me, you won't be able to brag about it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the second episode of Gaki no Tsukaiya,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Which do you like more, Chikitsuki or Dochiyan?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Gaki no Tsukaiya

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me explain.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's a panel here.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The upper part is my panel,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the lower part is yours.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll randomly put them on,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
depending on whether I like them or not.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then we'll go around each other.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's do that.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, let's put them on.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can't help worrying about this.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There are a lot of problems.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's just that this isn't our intention.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you look at it, you'll understand.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Which one should I start with?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's start with the one you hate.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's see.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's very popular.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Even on TV, it's definitely more than 20% white.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But...

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't like it at all.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you hate about it?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I hate this tail.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What do you hate about it?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, really?

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, no, no.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not my intention.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait a minute.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Shimura-san watches it every week.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't really like my hair.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Shimura-san, that's it.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you were a man, you should have said it more clearly.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why is it so thin?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Should I stretch it here?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This too...

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go, go!

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But as a senior in this world,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I think there are a lot of things I should learn.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, no, no.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think so.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right, but...

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What do you think about that?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't care about that.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't care about that.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I just don't like that part.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a matter of looks.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This guy!

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's the worst!

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't like it when I can't say anything.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's no good.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not a comedian.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sometimes I appear on Time TV.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I have to say it more clearly.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's disgusting to watch.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Agnes, I want you to say you like it.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then I'll say,

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Agnes, you've changed.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't think I've changed.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Applause!

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't like the way he sings.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't like it!

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Say what you like.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mr. Chage...

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Does Mr. Chage wear a hat often?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, he does.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's because...

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He looks good in a hat.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why does Mr. Chage always wear a hat?

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because he likes it.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As soon as I saw him,

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I thought he was a bald man.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You don't like me, do you?

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Here's a chicken.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is that okay?

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This guy just came out.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's next?

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, no, no.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't like it at all.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What do you not like?

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The one in the middle, Ryu-chan.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know anyone who can sing a song of Dorikamu.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There aren't many people who can sing it.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What is it?

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's like God's E Kanji no Kinyoubi.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't sing such a lousy song!

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The title is bad!

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What is that God's E Kanji no Kinyoubi?

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's funny!

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're the one who's in trouble!

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What kind of song is this?

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's not enough data.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's always like that.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have a lot of fans.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Seriously.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's no airing here.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you raise your hand,

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think you'll say,

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I can't do that.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Seriously.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's be honest.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you have a fan?

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry!

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I do have one.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're doing something right now, right?

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your face when you're flying!

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When you're flying.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Your face is like a raccoon.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When you're flying.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
When you're flying, you're like,

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What the hell, you idiot!

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're going to get in trouble!

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to get in trouble!

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm scared!

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm in trouble.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm in trouble.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Shut up.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's really hard.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What is?

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've been through a lot.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have to do my best.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you talking like that?

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's wrong?

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's still cold, isn't it?

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was cold today.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It was cold today.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you think about it,

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's almost cold in a year, isn't it?

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's not true.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why are you talking like that?

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's almost cold in a year.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's almost cold in a year, isn't it?

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's the end of the season.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
When I was a kid,

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's a ceremony, right?

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I thought it was divided into four.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's half cold.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's been cold since October.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's 11, 12, 1, 2, 3.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Look, it's been six months.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's half cold in a year.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's right.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's different because it's cold all year round.

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's half cold in a year.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's cold today.

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What are you talking about?

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You have to think about it again.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What do you mean?

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
About the audience.

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How do you think about the audience?

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I used to do it with only men.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You've done it once, haven't you?

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Only young men.

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Only young men.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know if I can think about it a little more.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know if I can think about it a little more.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There are a lot of couples these days.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's annoying.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's annoying.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's annoying.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know what it is.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you think we're a bit of an outcast?

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you think Michael Jackson is in it?

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I came to see something on AVEC.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You used to do a project, didn't you?

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
A signing project.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you do it?

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's getting warmer.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm thinking about it.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Downtown Pure Land.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Downtown Pure Land.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Downtown Pure Land.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Pure Land.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's a word.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're lying.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Downtown Pure Land.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Downtown Pure Land.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Downtown Pure Land.

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Downtown Pure Land.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Downtown Pure Land.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, Machan, Hama-chan.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They're wearing stuffed animals.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's something like Kitty.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Something like this.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We don't move like that.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There are a lot of things.

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What about rides?

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's a magic carpet.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh.

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You and I are holding a board.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Everyone's wearing a lot of things.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's like this.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's like a break.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, no, no.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's like an amateur's break.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There's that, too.

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
While looking at the screen.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hey, hey, hey.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Star Tours.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll do that.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In Akichi?

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, there's usually a screen.

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What do you do in Akichi?

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll do it as a child's user.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You'll see when you think about it.

217
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So there are a lot of parts that have been cut.

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll show you on the big screen.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I couldn't broadcast it.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll show you on the big screen.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The chair won't move.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't need that.

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't need that.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't feel good.

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not listening to you.

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is this it?

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's something called Machan experience and Hama-chan experience.

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What kind of experience is that?

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's why.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You see it, don't you?

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's like a child's user.

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm on the Machan experience.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There's a story.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you get hit in the head by Hamada,

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Something from above.

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can see it from Machan's point of view.

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can see it.

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's true, but...

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's better to be on my side.

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If I'm on your side, I won't cry.

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What do you mean?

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's my life.

243
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then you'll do something on your side.

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll be on your side.

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll be on your side.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's fun to watch it from a distance.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Everyone's on your side.

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then downtown stores.

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's common.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Downtown goods.

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's one more thing.

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Downtown stores are like that.

253
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Inexhaustible.

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Vegetables?

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Vegetables.

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Inexhaustible vegetables.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's how it is.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you want to do it?

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is a new project.

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you want to come, please come.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll do it.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just spin it?

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Then you can enjoy it?

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can enjoy it.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You and I will hold it like this.

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's about three people.

268
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No, no, it's different.

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There's nothing like this down there.

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's no stick like that.

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's all mine.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's huge.

273
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Why?

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can put three people on it.

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's impossible.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't do it alone.

277
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You don't have any strength.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You don't have any strength.

279
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's not true.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You don't have any grip.

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Try it.

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why is your face like this?

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm angry.

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't go to a sports club.

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What is that?

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're angry because you don't have any strength.

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm angry.

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

294
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Something's wrong with your arm.

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's a story about Kaioka.

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
A sports club.

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Really?

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Our soccer player, Takasu,

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
won a squash prize.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If I start playing squash,

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
do you want to play it

304
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
when we play against each other?

305
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sure.

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's say I play squash for half a year

307
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and I get better

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and I become like Fujii Tatsuya.

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
only for casters.

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you become like that,

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
do you want to play against me?

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The punishment game this time is tough.

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's already decided.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This time,

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm going to skydive

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
without a parachute.

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If something happens to me,

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll die.

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Just in case.

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll jump without a parachute.

322
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just in case.

323
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If nothing happens to me,

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll die.

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll die.

326
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's play against each other.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Really?

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are you going?

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's play.

330
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's play against each other.

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't care.

332
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why are you so angry?

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't care.

334
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Just throw it to me.

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If you don't do that,

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
you'll get in trouble.

337
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll be kind to you.

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Do you play tricks recently?

339
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I changed my number.

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Your phone number?

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't care.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't care.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll throw it to you.

344
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I want to go in.

345
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I want to go in.

346
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to go in.

347
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If I go in,

348
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll get in trouble.

349
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't care.

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll be kind to you.

351
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In the past,

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
in the past,

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I used to shout.

354
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But now,

355
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't do that.

356
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't do that.

357
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't do that.

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You have to be there.

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't have a place to go.

360
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
My voice is like this.

361
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Like this.

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Like this.

363
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Like this.

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Like this.

365
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Like this.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like this.

367
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
When I come home,

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
there's something in front of the door.

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There was an erotic video.

370
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There was an erotic video.

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm happy.

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't know if I'm happy or not.

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's the content?

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Last erotic video of a girl.

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There was something.

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I saw it.

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I saw it.

378
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I saw it.

379
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I saw it.

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't help it.

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's why.

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's like this.

383
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
People who watch TV

384
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
have their own ideas.

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's weird.

386
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm in trouble.

387
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If so,

388
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What will you do?

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I add pressure to my back.

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I add pressure to my back.

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is not the back.

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is this the back?

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
A pack that puts pressure on your back.

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
A pack that puts pressure on your back.

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Put pressure on it.

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Ah, this is a bit similar to what I said earlier.

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Ah, is that so?

398
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Why is the phone's cord not straight, but curved?

399
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's right, if you say it like that.

400
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's like an electric wire.

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What do you mean, an electric wire?

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
To stop broadcasting.

403
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's not it!

404
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's an electric wire!

405
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What do you mean, an electric wire?

406
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What do you mean, an electric wire?

407
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What do you mean, an electric wire?

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What do you mean, an electric wire?

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's not it!

410
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's an electric wire!

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's scary, an electric wire.

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why is that?

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why is that?

414
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's scary.

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You call it an electric wire?

416
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Put in a booo.

417
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

418
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
An electric wire.

419
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's an electric wire!

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why is there a booo?

421
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why is there a booo?

422
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why is there a vacuum cleaner?

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If you press it, it goes like this.

424
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's weird.

425
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But it's convenient, right?

426
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's convenient, but it's inconvenient.

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why?

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can't do it all at once.

429
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you use it for a year, it goes like this.

430
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you pull it a little more, it goes like this.

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No way, I can't put it in like this.

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's...

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's the vacuum cleaner.

434
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's the vacuum cleaner.

435
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, that's fine.

436
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why is it spinning?

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why is it spinning?

438
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is my plan for NTT.

439
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What does that mean?

440
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's my plan to charge a little more for the phone bill.

441
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you charge it directly, it won't take long to charge the phone bill, right?

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If you extend the distance like this,

443
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the phone bill will go up a little.

444
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Such a code...

445
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Such a code will reduce the phone bill.

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes, it will reduce it.

447
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So, normally, when you say hello,

448
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
you say hello, right?

449
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You say hello, right?

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's...

451
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hello?

452
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
At this point, it costs about 20 yen.

453
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is my plan for NTT.

454
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You're the only one who can do this.

455
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Idiot!

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Even now, the phone's function is getting complicated.

457
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't keep up with it.

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What do you mean?

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Like a transfer phone...

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I thought about it.

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
A machine to prevent prank calls.

462
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's a little complicated.

463
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You can use a transfer phone.

464
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
For example,

465
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the Japanese NTT will rent an apartment in Brazil.

466
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Wait a minute.

467
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Say it again.

468
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What?

469
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The NTT...

470
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The NTT will rent an apartment in Brazil?

471
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Rent an apartment.

472
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If the NTT goes to Brazil,

473
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it won't be a problem for the hotel, right?

474
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The employees, right?

475
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What are you talking about?

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Go anywhere!

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Without a share.

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Without a share.

479
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Without a share.

480
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't care.

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't care.

482
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't care.

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
To Brazil.

484
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Even an apartment.

485
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Even an apartment.

486
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Even an apartment.

487
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's easy.

488
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For example,

489
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
a prank call will be sent to my place.

490
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll make it a transfer phone.

491
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'll send it to Brazil.

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then, the person who called me

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
will be in Brazil.

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Amazing!

495
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Even if I talk for 5 minutes,

496
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it will cost thousands of yen.

497
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
With this, a prank call won't be a loss.

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
At that time,

499
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll say,

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
what color are your pants?

501
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What color are your pants?

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's 2800 yen.

503
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's more expensive than my pants.

504
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
After the wedding,

505
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I often see you two

506
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
riding a car.

507
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What is the empty can

508
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
behind the car?

509
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why?

510
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Are you going to put an empty can behind the car?

511
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I whisper to you.

512
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You must be crazy.

513
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm sure.

514
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sure.

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sure.

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm sure.

517
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sure.

518
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sure.

519
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's not me.

520
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Someone is behind me.

521
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm not that powerful.

522
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What are you doing?

523
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Why is it an empty can?

524
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do you know the saying,

525
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
if the wind blows,

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
if the wind blows,

527
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
you will go there.

528
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You will go there.

529
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Marriage is happiness.

530
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Happiness is an empty can.

531
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You laughed.

532
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You laughed.

533
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Why is happiness an empty can?

534
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What are you talking about?

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What are you talking about?

536
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Why?

537
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm not that powerful.

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What are you talking about?

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm not that powerful.

540
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There are many people watching.

541
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There are many people watching.

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There are many people watching.

543
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Right?

544
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Happiness is an empty can.

545
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why?

546
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Happiness is

547
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
a dream.

548
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
A dream is

549
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
a night.

550
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
As a government.

551
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A night is

552
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
a dark night.

553
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It sounds like a kid's idea.

554
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
A dark night is a ghost.

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
A ghost is scary.

556
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Right?

557
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Scary is an empty can.
