1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Since the last time I was on a TV show, my life has changed a lot.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But recently I've been receiving a lot of information.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There was a man who was more stingy than I was.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That man's name is...

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Masumoto Hitoshi.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What the hell, you idiot!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Masumoto Hitoshi will be the judge of the Seco Seco trial.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why am I so stingy?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is Masumoto really stingy?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tonight, the truth will be revealed.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're going to die!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're going to die!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're going to die!

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We will now begin the Seco Seco trial of Masumoto Hitoshi.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Prosecutor and the plaintiff, please enter the court.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Next, the defendant, Masumoto Hitoshi, please enter the court.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The defendant, please take a seat over there.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Prosecutor, please read out the verdict.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Masumoto Hitoshi is a very popular comedian.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He is a very popular comedian.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But he is a very stingy man.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The size of his bowl is exactly like a choco.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't understand the meaning of a choco.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, the size of his bowl is exactly like a choco.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He is causing a lot of trouble to the people around him.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We will now begin the Seco Seco trial of Masumoto Hitoshi.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Understood.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We will now begin the Seco Seco trial of Masumoto Hitoshi.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Prosecutor Hamada, please present the evidence.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We have received a lot of complaints from different sides.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
First, please watch this video clip.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is when Matsumoto went on a trial trip with the three of them.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The incident happened on the last day.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Matsumoto-san, we still have three hours before the flight. What should we do?

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I wonder what we should do.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, that's right.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There is a very luxurious pool near this hotel. Do you want to swim there?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alright, let's swim.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The three people who moved to the nearby hotel immediately went to the pool.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, no, no. Stop, guys.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What?

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The three people who were called by the hotel's security guard.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In fact, in this pool, you have to pay $20 for admission, except for the guests.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yamasaki, who found out about this, said...

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right. Well, $20 is fine.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
However, Matsumoto said...

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That won't be paid.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What? $20 is fine, isn't it? You can't swim in the pool.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then who will pay?

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And since we swam a lot yesterday, the water will be gone.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
As soon as Matsumoto realized that he had to pay $20, his attitude changed.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
However, the hotel's security guard who saw this said...

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you promise me not to go into the water, you can stay by the poolside.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's what he said.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's fine. Then let's go home.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yamasaki, who tried to go home because he thought it would be meaningless if he didn't go to the pool.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
However, the moment Matsumoto found out about this...

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
All right.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He started swimming in the poolside.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It feels so good.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In the end, Yamasaki spent three hours with Matsumoto in the poolside.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Who are you?

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hello.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm calling the witness.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Please come to the witness stand.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, please.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Of course, we're on VTR now.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Does that mean we're on VTR Street?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's been a while since we went on a trip.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
At the end of the trip, we had to pay for the pool.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I thought I could just go in.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought I could just go in.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey, don't let him catch you.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
My job is over there.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you mess with me there, I won't be able to stand up.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I know that.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why don't you just go in?

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What do you mean by just going in?

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I got it.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you just go in, you can't go in.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's what I just saw.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I just want to ask you something.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You have to pay 20 dollars.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's about 2,000 yen.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What about you?

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I thought 2,000 yen would be fine.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You have 3 hours.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you can go in, let's go in.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I went in.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He should have more money than you.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know why.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's right.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's here.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, the defendant.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I want to make this clear.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to go back in time to what happened the day before.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He really likes Bakuchi.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yamada-kun, the hammer.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Who?

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yamada-kun.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who the hell are you?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What do you mean by Yamada-kun, the hammer?

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He hasn't been hit at all.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He hasn't been hit?

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just hit him.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It was close.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I completely avoided it.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You like Bakuchi.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I like Bakuchi.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Since the day before, this idiot has been playing Bakuchi like an idiot.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This time, I'm not going to do that.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We came up with the theme of going straight to Nikko.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I see.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's been playing Bakuchi all the time.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In the end, he lost 400,000 yen.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, 800,000 yen.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's 800,000 yen.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I lost 800,000 yen there.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Think about it here.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can't spend any more money on Yamazaki.

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If that's the case, why don't you pay him?

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
About 20 dollars.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's a separate payment.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do you mean by separate payment?

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want to spend any more money on Yamazaki.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I get it.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The three of us can just say yes.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I wonder what it is.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is it?

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why don't you pay him?

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Isn't that strange?

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If the guy who spent that much is willing to pay 20 dollars, that's fine, isn't it?

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's not it.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I wanted to say that to the guard at the hotel.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who do you think you are?

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I caught Yamazaki, who lost 800,000 yen.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know what he's talking about with 20 dollars on top of that.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But...

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let me drink the water of the pool.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I lost 800,000 yen.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I lost 200,000 yen.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's right.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I wanted to enjoy those three hours with you.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then I'll ask you a question.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What do you know?

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What?

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's wrong with you?

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You mean I couldn't get in?

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't know because you didn't pay 20 dollars?

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you know about that?

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's 6,000 yen.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't be ridiculous.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Stop it.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Stop whining.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Idiot.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What do you know about 6,000 yen?

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong with you?

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When was the last time you had fun with someone?

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You!

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You!

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Die!

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Die!

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You die!

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll kill you!

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll kill you!

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
When was the last time you had fun with someone?

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't have fun!

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I had lots of fun!

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You didn't even notice you were dead!

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're crazy!

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're the boss!

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Boss?

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Boss?

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's okay.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're the boss on the weekend.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll stop on the weekend.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No. It's okay.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was a few years ago, when Miyasako was invited to Matsumoto's house for the first time after the rain.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, whatever.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm coming in!

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Wow, amazing!

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's a piano and a piano stand!

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's Matsumoto-san for you!

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Alright, let's go!

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He got excited at the billiards and forgot that time was passing and went to play.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And after a while, Matsumoto said...

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm hungry. Should I get some rice?

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, that's great!

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Matsumoto-san is coming! I'm sure he'll treat us to a high-class meal!

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
By the way...

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Miyasako, can you go to the convenience store for a bit?

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Go buy whatever you like.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, and don't forget the donbei!

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I really like that!

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Miyasako's expectations were crushed and he ended up going to the convenience store.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And when he came back from shopping...

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sorry to keep you waiting!

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
See you later. Here's 1,000 yen.

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, um...

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
When he saw the shopping bag Miyasako was holding in his hands, it was obvious that 1,000 yen wasn't enough.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
However, he couldn't say that Matsumoto didn't have enough money.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Miyasako paid for the rest with her own money.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And Matsumoto said...

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Donbei is the best! The best in the world!

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He kept saying that and kept cutting down on donbei.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That was a terrifying incident.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please take the money.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Are you okay?

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Good luck!

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Please be honest with us.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We won't hurt you.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
To be honest, I came into this world with a dream.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I thought that if I worked hard in this world, I could become rich and eat a lot of delicious food.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I didn't understand why a rich man would want to eat donbei all over the world.

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
To be honest, I didn't have any money back then.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But my wife is also very poor.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Good luck!

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The problem is...

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Are you okay, Hikoku?

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He didn't order delivery food or go out to eat.

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I think that's okay.

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's okay to have such a situation.

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Right?

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't you blame him for that?

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When you saw the amount of money he bought, you thought that 1000 yen wasn't enough.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Did you think about that?

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
First of all, what I want to say is...

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't think that Matsumoto in downtown is amazing.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't want to show the arrogance of a comedian.

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's why I want to be at the level of the general public.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So you don't want to show arrogance?

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I understand that.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't want to show arrogance.

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's why I didn't order delivery food and went to the convenience store.

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I understand that.

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But I know that my junior is writing a letter.

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't tell him to give me money and go.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I told him to go.

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
When he came back, he had a lot of luggage.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
1000 yen wasn't enough.

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Didn't you understand that?

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
To put it simply, I understood.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I see.

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When I think about it, 2000 or 3000 yen wasn't enough.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It costed 2000 or 3000 yen.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I understand that.

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What about the money you gave?

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The money I gave was about 1000 yen.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is 2000 yen.

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What are you going to do?

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What are you going to do?

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is it.

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
During that time, I had a lot of conversations with Miyasako.

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I gave Miyasako about tens of millions of money that she couldn't see.

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I should have stolen a lot of things from her.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
At this time, I did this.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
At this time, I did that.

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I should have given Miyasako a lot of funny things.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you think about the amount of money, 1000 yen is easy to get.

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hey, Tsukushi.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey, Tsukushi.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hey, Shonin.

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Please choose a word.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
To be honest, this is a long time ago.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Please give it back.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why?

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I want to make my wife eat something delicious.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know if I can say this.

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Your partner can't speak.

281
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
By the way, Hikobu.

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Not Hikobu, Shonin.

283
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Is he at the scene?

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He was there.

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Were you there?

286
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't know.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was there.

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Everyone was there.

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I was there, too.

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You don't know?

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Wasn't there such a thing?

293
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't think so.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sure there is.

295
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Are you sure it's true?

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's true.

297
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But Hikobu said it was the amount of money.

298
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What do you think?

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I've learned a lot from him.

300
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I see.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I've learned a lot from him.

302
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've learned a lot from him.

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I see.

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What are you talking about?

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
When I'm eating, I can't pay.

306
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
When I go to the convenience store, I can't pay.

307
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We'll talk about that later.

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We met for the first time at that time.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I see.

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I didn't pay for anything.

311
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I paid you first.

312
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
From now on, my memories with Matsumoto will expand.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's a concession.

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How much do you owe me?

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sure you owe me.

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sure you owe me.

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sure you owe me.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't owe you at that time.

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't owe you.

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't owe you.

321
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't owe you.

322
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You can sue me for something else.

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't want to sue you.

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're just saying it.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Thank you very much.

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you very much.

327
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to sue you.

328
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm going to sue you.

329
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm going to sue you.

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's Matsumoto and now.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's when Yamashita, the former Jyarizumu, went to a bar.

332
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're doing your best these days.

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm doing a little more.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yamashita, how about you?

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I can't do it at all.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You have to do it better.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The three of them got excited and the meal was over.

338
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's time to pay.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's decide who pays with rock-paper-scissors.

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's fine.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's do it.

342
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But Yamashita doesn't earn as much as the other two.

343
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So...

344
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Please give me a hand.

345
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If I win, I win.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Mr. Imada wins twice.

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If Matsumoto wins three times, he wins.

348
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What do you think?

349
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Then...

350
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why do you have to do it with a hand?

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I just want you to do it with a hand.

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Even though Yamashita's earnings were hundreds of times as much, Matsumoto didn't accept this offer at all.

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In the end, he decided to play rock-paper-scissors.

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
All right, let's go.

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a one-on-one game.

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

357
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I lost.

358
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
All right.

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
In the end, Yamashita, who lost, had to pay the fee.

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a one-on-one game.

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Again, this kind of incident.

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
All right.

363
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Chief.

364
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The witness.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The witness, please come in.

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Here you are.

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yamashita, who just appeared on the VTR.

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Let me explain.

369
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Are you all right?

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you all right?

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Are you all right?

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I lost a hundred times.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Rock-paper-scissors was good.

374
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Actually, I've done it before.

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
With Yamazaki and Miyasako.

376
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Is that so?

377
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yamazaki said, I'll do it with a hand.

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I see.

379
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I enjoyed it as a game.

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's right.

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yamazaki felt that way, so I thought he'd do it for me.

382
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please give me a hand.

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Then suddenly.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Why don't you give me a hand?

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't know what I want to get.

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's right.

387
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Why don't you give me a hand?

388
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm not the one to give you a hand.

389
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
First of all.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
All right.

392
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're up.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm up.

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm up.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's good.

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're up.

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're up.

398
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm up.

399
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're up.

400
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're up.

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're up.

402
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You're up.

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You're up.

404
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You're up.

405
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're up.

406
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You're up.

407
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm really fond of Matsumoto.

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes.

409
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I want to see something cool.

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I see.

411
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So I saw something cool.

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What is it?

413
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I went to a bar with Nakai of SMAP.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes.

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I saw a naked Nakai.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's not good.

418
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's not good.

419
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's not good.

420
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're my junior.

421
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You're my junior.

422
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Matsumoto-san.

423
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's not good.

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You can call him Gochisousama.

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But you can't call Nakai-san Gochisousama.

426
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Not only me.

427
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can't call Imaya-san Gochisousama.

428
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's a fact.

429
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's Matsumoto-san.

430
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No.

431
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's not good.

432
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I know that.

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's right.

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's a defendant.

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You know.

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
This is.

437
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not a personal problem.

438
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's not Nakai Masahiro vs. Matsumoto Hitoshi.

439
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's Yoshimoto Kogyo vs. Johnny's problem.

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Which one of you is winning now?

441
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No, no, no.

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It has nothing to do with Nakai.

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It does! It's between the agencies.

444
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, that's not it. You're older than Nakai.

445
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Lion Heart sold a lot.

446
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But they don't have much money.

447
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That has nothing to do with me.

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
For the time being...

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What the hell are you?

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What the hell are you?

451
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm just saying it's a personal problem.

452
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Go home.

453
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was at the scene, too.

454
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You were there.

455
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When I was paying for the money,

456
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Nakai asked me to pay for it.

457
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Matsumoto-san refused at first.

458
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I said, I'll pay for it.

459
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We're always like this.

460
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We're the old ladies in Osaka.

461
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I said, I'll pay for it.

462
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I thought the scene would begin.

463
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He said, really?

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
He's really weak.

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No, no, no.

466
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You guys are stupid.

467
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What are you thinking?

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm asking why you don't pay for it.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'll pay for it, you idiot!

470
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll pay for it.

471
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll pay for it.

472
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll pay for it.

473
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Do your best.

474
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What are you talking about?

475
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'll pay for it.

476
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll pay for it.

477
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You'll pay for it.

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No, you guys don't know.

479
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You guys don't know.

480
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll pay for it.

481
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll pay for it later.

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
When I pay for it abroad,

483
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm paying for it.

484
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
With Matsumoto-san's wallet.

485
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's why I know everything.

486
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You're not moving.

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I know the places you pay for it.

488
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That's not true!

489
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's why he's asking for it!

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm not paying for the places Matsumoto-san asks for.

491
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't care if you don't pay for it.

492
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Do your best!

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't care!

494
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You're a talented comedian.

495
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You are all the same!

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
All die!

497
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You just go back to normal.

498
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why?

499
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You should have told me.

500
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Say that.

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Say that, not that.

502
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Here!

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What?

504
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What is that?

505
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Please hold us.

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Mr. Shuzaku.

507
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Please be angry.

508
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No way.

509
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Gasoline.

510
00:23:41,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Gasoline.
