1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The incident is always sudden

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Manager Shimizu came in before the recording

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The chief manager Okamoto is calling everyone again

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Emergency special project manager Okamoto is angry again

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okamoto suddenly stopped last time and asked for reverse bungee

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
His anger seems to have subsided

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Why are you telling me to do bungee?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
3, 2, 1, go!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What is his purpose this time?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Where are we today?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a little scared

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You are a little fast

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't come!

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You are very fast

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've been doing it for a year

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I thought I was doing it for a year

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What is this?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I've done it 3 times

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okamoto is very serious

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
After the incident, I was in a good mood

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I felt like I could do it again

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I didn't say anything at the scene

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was surprised

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Did I look like I wanted to do it again?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was looking at it with my eyes

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I was looking at it with my eyes this time, but I didn't know

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's go home

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The scene is close

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
An inexplicable anxiety touched everyone's hearts for a moment

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Over there

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Over there?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Where?

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Over there?

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm here

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's hot

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Over here?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When we finally arrived at the scene, we looked for Okamoto

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There he is

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry up

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Run

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have to run

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you doing?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come closer

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know you

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm your manager

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I know you

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you doing?

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm fixing it

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's easier if you do it by hand

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can't do it by hand

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's strange

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You guys are not doing well

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All of us?

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, the cast and the staff

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you too lazy?

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's dangerous

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sorry to keep you waiting

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's not doing anything

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's hungry

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's walking

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hamada

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Have you been working lately?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Look, he's angry

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why are you walking?

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's why you're slacking off

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is the second time you're angry

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why are you angry?

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wait

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What?

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's angry

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't care about the cat

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let him go

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Look at that

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The numbers here

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's good

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why can't I get 20?

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's 0.1

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's 24

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Here

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I see

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
0.1

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're noisy

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll do the opening

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Can I do it?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's the manager's line

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why are you doing this to me?

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't want to do it

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We don't even think about it

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
0.1

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's hard

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You have 20 in your head

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's close

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's close

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me do the giant guillotine

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll do it

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't need you

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll do it

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Manager Okamoto challenges the giant guillotine

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is this it?

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is impossible

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is bad

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The giant guillotine is 15 meters high

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It falls at a speed of 80 km

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't have to do it

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll do it

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll make a good face

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me do it

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
0.1

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's ok

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll do the giant guillotine

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I have a camera here

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can make a good reaction

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's up

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okamoto

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you ready?

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll do it

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Start

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okamoto

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's amazing

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's good

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's good

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's Okamoto

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's Okamoto

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's looking at me

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wait

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you doing the next one?

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The next one?

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You were doing our reaction

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Our reaction is not good

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just look at me

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's angry

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't see his teeth

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's right

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
3, 2, 1

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Start

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Start

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It hurts

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you ok?

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you ok?

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're not angry anymore, are you?

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm good

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can do it

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What do you mean?

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My face

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can do it

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You passed 20

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I got it

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Here?

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Excuse me

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I passed 20

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't know how to do it

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know how to do it

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Take this off

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Can I do it?

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He's crazy

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's hard

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Animals are crazy

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Chimpanzees are crazy

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The chimpanzees are crazy

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They are happy

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't know if they are happy

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't know if they are happy

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They are crazy

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There is no one who can do it

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There is no one

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They say chimpanzees are crazy

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But that's not true

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They don't like being reacted

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They don't like being reacted

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They don't like being reacted

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
A smart chimpanzee is like this

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A smart chimpanzee is like this

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's just a short story

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
A smart chimpanzee is like this

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You can sit down

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But he welcomes you

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He welcomes me?

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ah

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He attacks me

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He's so angry

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He is so angry

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He has the same temper

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a welcome ceremony.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What?

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're eating a banana with your hand?

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's like, okay, okay.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But if you do it the other way, it's natural, right?

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm getting paid for it with my hand.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
For yourself?

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're getting paid for it.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's what I'm talking about.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's kind of nice.

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I have a new project.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't really want to say it, but...

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm going to throw a pie at various animals.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
At first, an elephant.

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I went to the elephant and did it right here.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know what's so frustrating about that.

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't think it's frustrating.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I thought it was hard, but there was a giraffe over there.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You saw it, didn't you?

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The giraffe started to make a noise.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What should I do?

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's being thrown.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What should I do?

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What should I do?

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's what I'm talking about.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your friends are heavy, aren't they?

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's kind of like that.

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's a crocodile.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The crocodile came out like this.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you do it like this, it's just like that.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It doesn't matter.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, yeah.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Animals are so stupid.

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know what to do with that.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
They're so stupid.

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's not going to work on humans.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't know what they think.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What do you mean?

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know what they think.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They're really low-education addicts, aren't they?

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm not an addict.

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a lot of work.

241
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I guess so.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You don't clean, do you?

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What do you mean?

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Your house.

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I clean my own room.

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You don't like cleanliness, do you?

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I like cleanliness.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's not it.

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, it's stuck.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What's stuck?

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't clean cleanliness.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't like getting dirty.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, I see.

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You know what?

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They're all wrong here.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You say you like fish, right?

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I like fish.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I like fish.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How many times do you eat grilled fish?

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you really like fish, you can't eat it.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you say that, you can't eat anything.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're so excited.

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Damn it.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If we don't do it together, we can't do it.

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's why I'm worried.

267
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's do a impersonation first.

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Sure.

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The one you like recently?

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's Toyokawa Etsushi.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm the only one who can impersonate him in Japan.

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You said you liked it recently, but the audience is brainwashed.

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's do Toyokawa Etsushi.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If it's Yamada-san's impersonation, the letter won't get through.

275
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is very similar.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Really?

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's amazing.

278
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm the only one who can impersonate him in Japan.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's Toyokawa Etsushi.

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If it's Yamada-san's impersonation, the letter won't get through.

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's do it.

282
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If it's Yamada-san's impersonation, the letter won't get through.

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you want it, I'll give it to 200 people.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You should go to a bookstore and buy it.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll ask Mr. Matsumoto.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What is the fastest way to swim in the current water sports?

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You haven't swum yet.

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I've been swimming for a long time.

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was born underwater for the first time in Japan.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry about that.

291
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It can't be helped.

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It was 31 or 32 years ago.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You've been swimming since then.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I still remember when I used water.

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You didn't swim.

296
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I did.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
When?

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
When did you start?

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm still swimming.

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm still swimming.

303
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I only swim when I'm at work.

304
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Basically, I'm underwater.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Where do you swim?

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I swim in the pool.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
In the pool?

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Really?

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I swim in the reservoir.

310
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Where?

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Don't go home.

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You swim in the reservoir.

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't care about that.

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I just want to say that I can swim faster than a crawler.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

316
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Swim like a crawler.

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This is the fastest.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's no good.

319
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Can you swim faster?

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What's the fastest?

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Like this.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

323
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is the fastest.

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You just want to dance.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I just want to dance.

326
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I swim like this.

327
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I swim like this and I run like this.

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Your posture has changed.

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm swimming in the water.

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What happened to your legs?

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm swimming in the water.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm swimming in the water.

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was wondering if your legs were like this.

334
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No.

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They are like this.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you have someone you like?

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No.

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How much rock spirit do you think you have?

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm a guitarist.

340
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm not a guitarist.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't have a guitar today, so I can't help it.

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm a guitarist.

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm a guitarist.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Your posture is strange.

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I've done almost everything you've ever done.

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm a guitarist.

347
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I smoke up here.

348
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Young people are crazy about dancing.

349
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
With that performance?

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Of course.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I've done a lot of pre-recording.

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I went to A-chan's concert.

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I want to see A-chan.

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Have you ever done A-chan's concert?

355
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's right.

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Go home! Go home!

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Play A-chan!

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But...

359
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Your music is different from A-chan's.

360
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why can't you get on?

361
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A-chan is good.

362
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
How many people have you done?

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
One.

364
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Have you ever done someone's back?

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Of course. I've done almost everything.

366
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Have you ever done someone's back?

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I've done almost everything.

368
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Can you give me an example?

369
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've done a lot of things.

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Sting, for example.

371
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're talking about a bad time.

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How many people have you done?

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't you know that?

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You can't talk to that guy.

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Can you tell me?

376
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
How many people have you done?

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
About four people.

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Four people?

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Sting, four people?

380
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's not four people. Why four people?

381
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Calm down!

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're making me nervous.

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What do you think you are?

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm alone.

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You don't think you're alone.

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's right. You're alone.

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You laughed a lot today.

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I was a little confused.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, okay.

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Who else?

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Most of them are over there.

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You can tell me.

393
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't know.

394
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
There are a lot of people.

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm nervous because there are a lot of people.

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I like a lot of people.

397
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I've done a lot.

398
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm really worried about being called alone.

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Please line up in order.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What kind of person did you come with?

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What kind of person did you come with?

402
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, yes, yes. Chicago.

403
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes, yes.

404
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't you have to say that?

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's only one Kiri.

406
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There's only one Kiri.

407
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I've done a lot of things.

408
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Chicago?

409
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's okay.

411
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're a lot more relaxed than before.

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And Basie Rollers.

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, is that so?

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's old again.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't say that it's old.

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Basie Rollers.

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And Neil Sedaka.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You're an old man.

419
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Why?

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's too cool.

421
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Have you ever done a chart?

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Of course, joint.

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I've done it.

424
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I did it with my wife's voice.

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Your music knowledge.

426
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Everything now.

427
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You're trying to twist it out.

428
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oishi Goroh is desperate.

429
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I understand.

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You don't have a guitar now, do you?

431
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm basically a twin.

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You twisted it out again.

433
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Where did you see it?

434
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm going to do this from now on.

435
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's amazing.

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's not working at all.

437
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What?

438
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Can you play something?

439
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No, I can't.

440
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can you play Spring Toe Fold?

441
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What's that trick?

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Don't you know?

443
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I do.

444
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why are you surprised?

445
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What's that?

446
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

447
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There's a lot of basics.

448
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You're twisting it out.

449
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's not Spring Toe Fold.

450
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's different.

451
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What do you mean?

452
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Spring Toe Fold.

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If you don't have a guitar, it won't work.

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can say it with your mouth.

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't know.

456
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm getting angry.

457
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You can say it with your mouth.

458
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It won't work.

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's really dirty.

460
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm really angry.

461
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Don't get angry.

462
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm really angry.

463
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll do it next time.

465
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If you don't do it, it won't work.
