New Year's Special Project

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
New Year's Special Project

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Happy New Year!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today is the New Year's Special Project.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
At the 99th Gaki no Tsukai Arahen,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we will be giving you the top 10 most interesting videos.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, I will be the general director.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am Yoshimoto Kogyo, Fujiwara Hiroshi.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Congratulations!

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the end of the formal greeting.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Everyone, looking back on 1999,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
how was it for you, Matsumoto-san?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, I don't know how to put it.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It was a year without much of this.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was a year without much of this.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Hamada-san.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's start with the top 10.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The video will be played.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The video will be played.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a game where you play in the bus.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is a game where you play in the bus.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The adults are trying to play the game.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The adults are trying to play the game.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The second point is Akihabara.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Akihabara.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Katsura.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sanshi.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Irasshai.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Katsura.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sanshi.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good job, Riki-chan.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're doing it wrong.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's start from the end.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Katsura.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sanshi.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Irasshai.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Katsura.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sanshi.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Irasshai.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Katsura.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sanshi.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Kazura!

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,000
Sanshi!

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Welcome!

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go apologize!

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was looking at Masamune for a second.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why?

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can't you borrow it?

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why?

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is this?

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm really moved.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're a pervert.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is weird.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Fukuoka Taihei Hokusu Japan 1st place! Congratulations!

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is funny.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It was fun.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I want to do this.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's a lot of money on it.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everyone, listen!

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe...

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
...Chuunichi will win.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's change it.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's change it to the Chuunichi version.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Chuunichi will win! Congratulations!

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wow!

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
B-class is here again.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
B-class comedians.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
B-class actors.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
B-class musicians.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
C-class copywriters.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Copywriters?

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a big event once a year. It's an event that gathers people from all over the world.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This time, there are a lot of people from all over the world.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's an exciting battle on the water.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Today's winner is...

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
...Kato Akari!

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Amazing!

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Bye bye.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
7th place is a child-friendly game.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a kiss-and-kiss game.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The players who have competed in the past have become the target of the game.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The downside of this game is that it's an exciting battle on the water.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The name of the person who took part in the Chouja Banzuke in 1999...

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
...best 10!

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Akashiya-sanma.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Akashiya-sanma!

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Akashiya-sanma!

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're the one who said it!

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No, no, no, wait a minute.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now...

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Please come out!

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That face...

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This guy licks his nose.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It stinks!

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It stinks!

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This idiot licked his nose!

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He has a good face.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That old lady really has a good face.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She even brought me a beer.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I mean, she did bring me a beer.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I read it and came here.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What's with the rain?

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was about to drown.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was about to drown.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're fast!

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why are you so slow?

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm getting really angry.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No, no, no, no, no.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Who saw that?

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You just said it and then...

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going home.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Really.

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Good luck.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Not yet, not yet.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's scary.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's scary.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I was looking at you.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This is no good.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is no good.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is no good.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is no good.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why are you so slow?

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is no good.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you doing?

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is no good.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:38,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Go, go, go!

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you okay?

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I hit you, I hit you!

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey!

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's wrong?

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I hit your leg.

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's wrong?

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're dead.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What?

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You can call an ambulance.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Where's the ambulance?

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There's an ambulance at the shopping mall.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why?

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's an ambulance at the shopping mall.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think that's strange.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You'll understand when you see this.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
When it's your turn, call an ambulance.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's an ambulance.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You'll understand when you see this.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I think you'll say the same thing.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But you should come here.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're an ambulance.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
An ambulance is strange.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll go for now.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll go for now.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I got the money.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I got the money.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Itabashi-san.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Madam.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Itabashi-san.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You can read it.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Of course, I can read it.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Tanaka Dayo, everyone, gather around!

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The red one.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Tanaka Dayo, who started the game with his own vision, has gathered around.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But at the end, Hamada was waiting for a tough prank to beat him.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're the winner!

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm the winner?

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Tanaka Dayo is the winner?

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why is it Tanaka Dayo?

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think this is strange.

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think this is strange.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What do you mean?

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What do you think, Yano-kun?

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What do you think?

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What?

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What do you think?

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You haven't done the same thing twice.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I did it on purpose.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I did it on purpose.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
On purpose.

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
On purpose.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're on purpose!

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What are you?

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is scary.

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,700
Hey, you're getting older!

196
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
What are you doing?

197
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
What are you doing?

198
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
It's a trap.

199
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
What is this?

200
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
It's a trap.

201
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Sorry.

202
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
You're lying.

203
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
I'm not lying.

204
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
You're lying.

205
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
You're lying.

206
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
You're lying.

207
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
You're lying.

208
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Wait a minute.

209
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
What's the problem?

210
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
You're crying.

211
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You're crying.

212
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I really thought you were going to cry.

213
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
I really thought you were going to cry.

214
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
That's not cool.

215
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
That's not cool.

216
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Please wait a minute.

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
That's not cool.

218
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
This is fun.

219
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
This is fun.

220
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You're so mean.

221
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
You're so mean.

222
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
You're so mean.

223
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Well, that's for the cut chocolate sauce.

224
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
That's all right.

225
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
It's a bad way to say later.

226
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Would it have been okay if I was in first place?

227
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Would it have been okay if I was in first place?

228
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Well, that's too bad.

229
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
You got a lot of punches.

230
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Well, I know.

231
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:40,700
As a good partner, this guy is a scary guy, a scary guy, and a good guy!

232
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
This is also...

233
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
This is also a famous scene from last year.

234
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,700
This project was carried out by Hamada, an inexperienced scuba diver, to the pool.

235
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,700
At the end of the year, we were supposed to take a commemorative photo at the bottom of the pool 5m deep.

236
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Don't make me laugh!

237
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Please let me go!

238
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
That's right!

239
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Hey, listen to me!

240
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,700
You can't talk about yourself at all, and you can't give it to me at all!

241
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
I'm screaming, but you can't give it to me at all!

242
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Finally, the 10th anniversary underwater commemorative photo was taken.

243
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
What happened to Hamada and Matsumoto?

244
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Hey, I'm starting to lose my confidence!

245
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
I'm definitely going to blow my head off!

246
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,700
That's shocking!

247
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I don't care if I blow my head off on a TV program like this!

248
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,700
If Hamada can't make it, I can't make it!

249
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Let's go over there!

250
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
It's okay, it's okay!

251
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
The 10th anniversary underwater commemorative photo was taken.

252
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
I wonder if I can get out of here?

253
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I think he's going to pass!

254
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
He's going to pass!

255
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,700
In the end, only Hamada was not able to dive.

256
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Even the commemorative photo was taken without Hamada.

257
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
24 hours! Hamada and Matsumoto are open!

258
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Today is the 3-second campaign of Nippon TV.

259
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
I'll challenge it live for a whole day!

260
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,700
It's raining today, so everyone, please bring an umbrella and go out!

261
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
We're in the middle of a commercial for Super TV!

262
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Four minutes until the next commercial.

263
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
Hamada changes his clothes in a hurry.

264
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Matsumoto's master is Stan Hansen.

265
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,700
This is a commercial for Super TV.

266
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
I didn't have time for this.

267
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
I don't understand at all.

268
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
I'm watching TV!

269
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,700
I don't understand at all!

270
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Everyone is in the middle of a commercial!

271
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
He's the uncle of pudding pudding.

272
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Everyone is in the middle of a commercial!

273
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
The cooking show is also in the middle of a commercial!

274
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
I didn't have time for this.

275
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Next, Matsumoto's instruction is...

276
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

277
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,700
The same person is also in the middle of a commercial in the weather report section of the news platform.

278
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Super TV, tonight at 9 o'clock.

279
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Next, Matsumoto's instruction is...

280
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
What is that?

281
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
My face is hotter than the one I know!

282
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm preparing for the avilence.

283
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,700
I'm wearing tiger pants.

284
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Are you kidding me?

285
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
24 hours, Hamada Masatoshi is in the middle of a commercial.

286
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
He only has one thing left to do.

287
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
I'm sorry, but this is the last one.

288
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
What is it?

289
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Is it a mess?

290
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Of course.

291
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
I think it means the last one.

292
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Next, Matsumoto's instruction is...

293
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Sakura fubuki no sarai no sora

294
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Mabushii to

295
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Finish it!

296
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
I see.

297
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
That's right.

298
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
That's right.

299
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Isn't this number one?

300
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
It's number one.

301
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
It's number one.

302
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
That was the best.

303
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Sugachan no Panchira Gekisha Dai-san.

304
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I wanted to see that.

305
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
That was also my favorite.

306
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Is it that?

307
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Is it the God of Gags?

308
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Is it the God of Gags?

309
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Is it that?

310
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
What is it?

311
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Is it that?

312
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Is it that?

313
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
This is the announcement of number one.

314
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Number one.

315
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Now, let's start the VTR.

316
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
What are you doing?

317
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
I think it's probably that.

318
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:47,700
And the number one is this project.

319
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm getting nervous.

320
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Kawasaki!

321
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Stop it!

322
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Alright!

323
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
I'm counting on you!

324
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Alright!

325
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Here I go!

326
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Good!

327
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm getting nervous.

328
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Do you see the difference?

329
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
It's vertical.

330
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Where is this?

331
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
It's here.

332
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
It's this big.

333
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
0.3 seconds.

334
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
It's 0.03 seconds.

335
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
It's 0.03 seconds.

336
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,700
It's the button.

337
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I can't get the button.

338
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
It's the God of Gags!

339
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Alright.

340
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
I admit defeat.

341
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Wait a minute.

342
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
I'm resisting.

343
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Do you admit defeat?

344
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
No, I don't.

345
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
I win!

346
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
So, Team Hamada!

347
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Penalty game!

348
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Penalty game!

349
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Penalty game!

350
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
You're really looking forward to the penalty game.

351
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
That's strange.

352
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
No, I don't want to do it.

353
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
I just want to do it smoothly and get a penalty.

354
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
That's right.

355
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
You're definitely thinking about something bad.

356
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,700
In the history of a battle that has created many great battles,

357
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,700
there is another battle that has carved a new page.

358
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,700
It's a battle of 100 meters of sweat and tears.

359
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,700
As a result, Team Hamada challenged Matsumoto, who betrayed the expectations of the big guy, and won.

360
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,700
And there is only one task left.

361
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,700
What kind of penalty game will Team Hamada play this year?

362
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
It's connected here.

363
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
It's connected.

364
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
That's right.

365
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
This is it.

366
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
The first place.

367
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
That's right.

368
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,700
The penalty game is also progressing steadily.

369
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,700
This time, it will be a penalty game with four people in total.

370
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,700
There are four people, so even if one person loses, there are three people.

371
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Even if one person loses?

372
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
For example, if one person dies.

373
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
It's the same as the next game.

374
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
It's a penalty game.

375
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
There's nothing I can't do.

376
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,700
If I had said something good, I wouldn't have been punished.

377
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
It's your fault.

378
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
That's right.

379
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
It's your fault.

380
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
It's really your fault.

381
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
I don't think the ending is that bad.

382
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,700
If Hamada-san had caught it, he wouldn't have lost.

383
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
This is your fault?

384
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
That's right.

385
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
What's wrong with this?

386
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
Of course, this person is also bad.

387
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,700
But if you look at me, you can see that I didn't make a mistake.

388
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,700
If you made a mistake there, Matsumoto-san would have panicked and we would have gone smoothly.

389
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
That's the start.

390
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
I know you're losing in the end game.

391
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,700
I can't make a mistake in the end game.

392
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
That's too naive.

393
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
You would have made a mistake.

394
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
You would have made a mistake.

395
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
That's the answer.

396
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Look at my belly.

397
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I made a mistake.

398
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
What? What is it?

399
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
What are you trying to do?

400
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
I don't know.

401
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,700
I wanted to say, look at my belly.

402
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
But there was a button.

403
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Calculate it.

404
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
That's the answer.

405
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I made a mistake.

406
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Please take care of me this year as well.

407
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Don't do that.

408
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:25,700
More importantly, look at my belly.
