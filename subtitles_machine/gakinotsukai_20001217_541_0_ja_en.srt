00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
High Tension The Best Ten.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good evening.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, what kind of people are coming to the show?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
To be honest, most of them are under 100 yen.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's the best ten.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The best ten?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All of them are like gamers.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's get started.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The 10th place of this week is...

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Kogoriko, Tanaga Naoki.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Good evening.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good evening.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Good evening.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Good evening.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the best ten.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
By the way, no one laughed when I put on this costume.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
First of all, it's a slip.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a slip.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's a slip.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't say anything.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I know.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then, let's go to the third place.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The 10th place of this week is Kogoriko, Tanaga Naoki.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The song of the sheep world.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait, sheep.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Listen to me, sheep.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't go that way.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Go that way.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, Kogoriko.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait, sheep.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't go that way.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This and that.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't go that way.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Degawa Tetsuro.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Good evening.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When we were divided into Hamada team and Matsumoto team, you did a terrible thing.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, Matsumoto-san.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's not true.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
After that, I bled.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I got an explosion at Happening.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's right.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I had a heart attack.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I saw the airing, but it was about 1 in 20.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Today, I did my best.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Today, I did my best.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then, the 3rd place, please.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000

Thank you very much.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Degawa-san, please take a seat.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Degawa-san, if you can sit down, please sit down.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you very much.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll buy everything from now on.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you saying?

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's all right.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's all right.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The 8th place of this week is...

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hotohara Toru, who wants to get rid of 151-year-old delusions.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you very much.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hotohara-san is the 8th place.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you very much for coming back.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This time, Hotohara-san is addicted to wine.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it wine?

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've prepared 3 kinds of wine for you today.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'd like to know how this wine tastes.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This is good.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is that so?

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is sold in Otaku.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is a wine from 1998.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is a wine with a monkey on it.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you don't have it, don't have it.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have a lot.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you all right?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Please tell me how it tastes.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is the taste I wanted.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is that so?

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is that all?

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is called Den Mille Anjou.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Den Mille Anjou?

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is called Den Mille Anjou.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Where is this from?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is from France.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is a wine that was made by following the French wine line.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is a good wine.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't drink it.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I know.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I just saw it.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Standby, please.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Standby, please.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr. Yamaoka.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't answer my questions.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's get started.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The 8th place this week is Hotohara-san who wants to get rid of the rain.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He is in a hurry because he is young.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He will Sophie.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He can't get rid of rain.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Strongly recommended.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Weak rain.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
BAM! BAM! BAM!

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Just One Kill!

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WINS!

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have 19 and 8 here.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They're not in the top 10 yet.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But they'll be in the rankings soon.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's look forward to it.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's introduce two young comedians.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The first one ranked 17th this week.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's Gori Ken.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Here he is.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Gori Ken

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is my first time meeting you.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Me too.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't have any data.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you have any close comedians?

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Degawa-san is my older brother.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
My older brother passed away.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I hope you'll do your best.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll do my best.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'd like to introduce myself.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do it.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'd like to introduce myself now.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Introduce yourself.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I see.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please stand by.

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know what kind of person he is.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's take a look.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
17th this week.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Gori Ken.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's Gori Ken.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a little funny.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't like it.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The second one ranked 13th this week.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's Mori Sanchu.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Here he is.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mori Sanchu

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is dirty.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you Yoshimoto?

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's your grade?

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How old are you?

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm 20 years old.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm 21 years old.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm 20 years old.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know your age.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're angry, aren't you?

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is funny.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
She's definitely a Kirie.

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How about you?

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm a girl.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have a boyfriend.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're lying.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you serious?

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What does your boyfriend do?

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I go to a vocational school.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How did you know each other?

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We're married.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why do you have this hairstyle?

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's strange.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's private.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What do you mean by private?

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can I say it?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why do you have this hairstyle?

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's private.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you like it?

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Stand by, please.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is scary.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're the one who lies the most.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Look at this.

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The second place is Miyuki Oshima.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is the worst.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What?

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
My leg...

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is the worst.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thank you very much.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Thank you very much.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's go back to the first place.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000

Fukawa-san.

Thank you very much.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you okay today?

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm okay.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Last time you got a lot of punches.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm okay.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I got a lot of punches.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Fukawa-san got a lot of punches today.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There's a phone call for Fukawa-san.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Really?

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm glad to hear that.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hello.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hello.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Ryo-chan.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Ryo-chan?

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's not Ryo-chan.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's not Ryo-chan?

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not Ryo-chan.

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Who is it?

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Mom, nice to meet you.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's Dantan.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ryo is taking care of me.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't have to say it.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Your son is not shining right now.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, I don't know.

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Please take care of him for a long time.

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
For a long time?

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000

This week's student is Fukawa Ryo.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Thank you very much.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you very much.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you very much.

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Please go to your seat.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you okay?

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can't forgive you even if you're a downtown person.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, no, no.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, no, no.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You should have cut it in reverse.

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I thought I had saved you.

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's go back to the 6th place this week.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
277 points.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The man with the most beans.

252
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Dachio Club, Ryuhei Ueshiba.

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Mr. Ueshiba has no stars today because of his work.

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The 5th place this week is...

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
298 points.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Please give me love.

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I want to erase the rain.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Miyasako Hiroyuki.

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Thank you very much.

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This week is the 5th place.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's going up.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Your partner has become like that.

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not sorry.

267
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's not a bad guy.

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
To be honest, I've only received 3 points so far.

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Please go to the 3rd place.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll go.

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The 5th place this week is Miyasako Hiroyuki.

272
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Please give me love.

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Nakamura Akira.

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yesterday, I looked at you very hard.

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you look back, your ass will be down.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You can not do this.

277
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
your ass will be down.

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If your ass is not in good condition, you can not do this.

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If your ass is not in good condition, you can not do this.

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Weak, Weak, You can not do that.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Weak, Weak, You can not do that.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Weak, Weak,

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Unigachan, when I look at you, I can't help but salivate!

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Unigachan, Unigachan, you're not going to die! You're not going to die! You're not going to die!

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Everyone who moves hates you!

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's a lie!

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you very much.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Next week's 4th place is...

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
360 points, Kouda Shin from Izukoe!

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Kouda Shin from Izukoe

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Kouda-san.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's not about Izukoe, it's about where you've come from.

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's what I want to say.

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Please stand by.

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This week's 4th place, Kouda Shin from Izukoe!

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Kouda Shin from Izukoe

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Kouda Shin from Izukoe

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Kouda Shin from Izukoe

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
See you next week.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Sit down.

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Sit down.

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Kouda-san, isn't this just a campaign?

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Sit down.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This week's SPOTLIGHT!

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This week's SPOTLIGHT is Mr. Shigenori Yamashita.

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Mr. Yamashita, this is SPOTLIGHT.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you very much.

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Mr. Yamashita, this beautiful flower has been selected as one of the 100 best flowers in Japan.

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's already been selected?

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's been selected as one of the 100 best flowers in Japan.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Really?

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Here's the answer.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Although it's a big flower, the hole is too small.

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But it's not a bad flower.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's good.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
However, this type of flower is slow to bloom.

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
As a comedian, the flower blooms at the age of 60.

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's slow.

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's slow.

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Please stand by.

323
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This week's SPOTLIGHT is Mr. Shigenori Yamashita.

324
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yamashita.

325
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yamashita.

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yamashita para para.

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yamashita para para.

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yamashita para para pyon.

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yamashita para para pyon.

330
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yamashita.

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yamashita.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yamashita pa pa.

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yamashita pa pa.

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes, pyon pyon pyon pyon pyon pyon pyon pyon.

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The 3rd place this week is...

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
454 points.

337
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hoi!

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Banzai Cholesterol edition.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Let's end the show here.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is what I expected.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You never got 1st place?

342
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I got 1st place in the past, but this Banzai Cholesterol edition is my first time.

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I got 3rd place.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I see.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You might get 1st place next year.

346
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's right.

347
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I definitely want to get 1st place.

348
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
However, when it comes to this...

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why do you say it's too much?

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's room for improvement.

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's not really...

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Stop it.

353
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Stop it.

354
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Stop it.

355
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Please stand by.

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you ready?

357
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Why are you laughing while you're getting ready?

358
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The 3rd place this week is...

359
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Kokoriko Endo Shouzo.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hoi!

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Banzai Cholesterol edition.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It didn't matter.

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
C O L E.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This. C O L E.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I love you.

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's why this is here.

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I love you.

369
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I love you.

370
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I love you.

371
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I love you.

372
