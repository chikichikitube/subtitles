00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, everyone, we have a letter from the mother who is in charge of the program.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me introduce her.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Nice to meet you. I always enjoy watching the program.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I see.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have a son named Yoshikatsu who will be 25 years old this year.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's a pretty old name.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He's a pretty old man.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Anyway, he's got a bad eye for people, so he's been locked in his room and hasn't been able to go out.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is a tough question.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It seems that he likes to use his energy to do things.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please tell us how it is to be outside.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Please do.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's a great answer.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's amazing. It's a life of one person.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wonder if he goes outside with his energy.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He's found something fun.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I like high tension, so I came to Shina today.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Plus my members.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Since you like high tension, your level of comedy is not that high.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, no, no.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Since you live nearby, you should go.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not good at it.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll do my best.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you can do your best, that's good.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is like the basis of comedy.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This might be the most difficult job.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Everyone, this is the end of the road.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, here it is.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is a nice house.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a nice house.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hello.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How are you?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You came to see me?

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello, everyone.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hello.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hello.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But Yoshi-chan...

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He didn't come out because he went in.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He didn't come out because he went in.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He didn't come out because he went in.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Is it okay to go to the front of the room?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's okay. Please come in.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, I'm here.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think he'll do his best.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please come in.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This program is provided by the sponsors you see.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Then, this kind of present is for you.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, the program's...

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All of them?

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you very much.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll go to Yoshi-kun.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yoshi-kun! Higaki no Tsukai gave me a present!

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Higaki no Tsukai?

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think it's from Hamada-san.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, I see.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't see his face.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yoshi-kun! I got you a present, so say thanks!

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yoshi-kun!

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What, Yoshi-kun?

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, what's this?

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Huh? Yamazaki-kun, I brought something.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What is it?

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's just for you, Yama-chan.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know this is the best selling one.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm getting old.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yoshi-kun loves to play with children.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I hope you can do something that makes Yoshi-kun happy.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I hope you can enjoy the world of Yosuzan.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I wonder...

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's hard to say...

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But as an entertainer, you have to have that kind of atmosphere.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can do it anywhere, anytime.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can do it for my Yoshi-kun.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I used to do it for Takeshi-san.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can do it for him?

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry, but I can't.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I see.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then, I'll prepare it for you.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Please.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry Endo.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think you want to get it fixed.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Really?

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Really?

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think you want to get it fixed.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wow.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The size.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shouatsu, you're wearing those pants?

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I bought them.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You bought them?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've been interested in them for a while.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Takesu, you're not like that.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I've never seen you like that.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's done.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's fast.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The size has changed.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's fast.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm counting on you, Endo.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yoshi-kun, we're ready.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yoshi-kun, let's go.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're going to catch the old man and his wife.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Wait a minute.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Dan-chan, Dan-chan, you are grinning. You have a good body. I know.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You should turn the car. Turn the car quickly.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Why did you take off your shirt?

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why did you take off your jacket? You are so annoying.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh!

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait a minute.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wait a minute.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hey, come here.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's not giving up at all.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey, Mr. Shunji.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're...

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't laugh.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't laugh.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Are you coming?

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you coming?

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you coming?

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you coming?

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go to sleep!

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go to sleep!

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, just a little bit more.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you don't have a car, you can use a bag.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Turn the bike, you bastard.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're wearing a bag.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're wearing a bag.

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're a bastard.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're a bastard.

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're a bastard.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come on.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you had told me, I would have told you.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're a bastard.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What are you saying?

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you saying?

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Jeez!

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What?

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're not even a little bit of a person.

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're just a little bit of a person.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yoshi-kun, you're really scared, aren't you?

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yoshi-kun, you don't have to be scared.

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Right?

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you want to see other comedians?

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Excuse me.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If possible, I'd like to ask you to be a more gentle comedian.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Gentle?

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What kind of person is this?

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Tanaka.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I said he's kind.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What should we do?

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What are you doing?

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I see.

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is...

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think he's holding it.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Takeshi-san is different.

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's done.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's a terrible thing to do now.

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What are you doing?

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yoshiko, what are you doing?

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why are you so calm?

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yoshiko, what are you doing?

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
Hey c'mon.

177
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,360
Get out of my room!

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,700
Stop it.

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,340
How have you been?

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,020
How have you been?

181
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,260
Yoshio...

182
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,940
How have you been?

183
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,460
Not getting out of your room...

184
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,760
Hey, hey, hey!

185
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,300
How have you been?!

186
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Ah, I touched you.

187
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
What are you doing?

188
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
What are you doing?

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Oh, it's fine.

190
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Come out.

191
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
What?

192
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
What's happening?

193
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
What's going on?

194
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Come out.

195
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
I'm a little scared.

196
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Come out quickly.

197
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,300
What's that?

198
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
What's that?

199
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,300
What is that?

200
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,300
How many years have you been doing this?

201
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
How many years?

202
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
14 years.

203
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
That's a long time.

204
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
Yoshi-kun! Yoshi-kun!

205
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Yoshi-kun!

206
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Are you okay?

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Which do you prefer? Kanto or Kansai?

209
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:09,300
I'm sorry, but this time I want you to be a comedian from Kanto.

210
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,300
What kind of way is that?

211
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:22,300
I don't like Kansai comedians.

212
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:32,300
I'm from Shibuya, Tokyo.

213
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Sing a song.

214
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
You sing.

215
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Let's go with the two of us.

216
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:52,300
On such a noisy street

217
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
You, who don't stop

218
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
He doesn't sing well.

219
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,300
The frozen body, gently rubbed against me.

220
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,300
You are a kisser.

221
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Oh my lilga, let me warm you up.

222
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Oh my lilga, I love you again and again.

223
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Oh, Marilu, we walk shoulder to shoulder in twilight

224
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:39,300
We can never, never be separated

225
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Ah, the last one

226
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
What's wrong with you?

227
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
You're not going to let me enjoy it at all, are you?

228
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
You look so upset

229
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Excuse me, madam

230
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Yes?

231
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,300
It's hard to hear.

232
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,300
It's a bit of a mess.

233
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
It's a mess.

234
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
It's fun.

235
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Fun?

236
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
It's hard to hear.

237
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Basically, everyone is having fun.

238
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Masao-san, where is Yoshino?

239
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Yoshino-san.

240
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
This is a so-called mother.

241
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm not a comedian, but...

242
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
An amateur?

243
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,300
An amateur. Well, an amateur with bad temper.

244
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
I hate it.

245
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I hate it.

246
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
You do that.

247
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Thank you.

248
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
The example.

249
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Thank you very much.

250
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
Surprisingly, that's what you're looking for.

251
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
It may be a half-hearted person.

252
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Yoshi-kun, we're ready!

253
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Yoshi-kun!

254
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Hard Wave!

255
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Come on out!

256
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
To a new world!

257
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Come on out!

258
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
This is fun!

259
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm not going to do it.

260
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Good.

261
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Your legs are like this.

262
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm not moving my waist at all.

263
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Move your waist more.

264
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
The sound of the wind.

265
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,300
If you move your waist more, it might come out.

266
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Move your body.

267
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
More, more, more, more.

268
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
More, more, more, more.

269
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
More, more, more, more.

270
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Good, good.

271
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Look at me.

272
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I'm not going to move.

273
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Look at me.

274
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
More, more, more.

275
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Here comes the tiger.

276
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,300
More, more, more.

277
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Shoot more, more, more.

278
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm happy.

279
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm happy.

280
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Shoot more.

281
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
More.

282
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Shoot more.

283
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I can't move at all.

284
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
I want to see more.

285
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
What is this?

286
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I don't know.

287
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
What is this?

288
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
You are just an amateur.

289
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
What is this?

291
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
I don't know.

292
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Nakamura-san, go home.

293
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I have a friend here.

294
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
You are so mean.

295
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Don't joke around.

296
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Go home.

297
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
You are acting like you are not going to win.

298
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
You should do it properly!

299
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I couldn't even speak in the second half.

302
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I don't know what to do.

303
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Ko-san.

304
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
I don't know what to do.

305
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
I want to go.

306
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
You don't like me, do you?

307
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
It's different from that.

308
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,300
I don't want to see you get hurt in the first half.

309
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
I see.

310
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
I like high tension.

311
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
You like it too much.

312
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I see.

313
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Then,

314
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Yashika-kun, this time a proper comedian will do it!

315
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,300
You're right.

316
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
It seems like you're ready, Dayama-chan.

317
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,300
I, Murayama Toyunichi, will be appointed as the Prime Minister of the Cabinet.

319
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
That's old.

320
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Yoshikun, what kind of Takako do you know?

321
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
I don't know.

322
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Yoshikun, what is this?

323
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,300
My opinion, my opinion is accepted and everyone is happy.

324
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,300
That's no good, that screen!

325
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
It's too early.

326
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Is this person really a comedian?

327
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
No, no.

328
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
What?

329
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I'm sorry.

330
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Please do it with someone else.

332
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
I think it's too early to say that.

334
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
I was thinking about it.

335
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
There's still a lot of time.

336
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Please do it with someone else.

337
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
I'm sorry.

338
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Then I'll do it honestly.

339
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Honestly,

340
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Honestly, I thought I wouldn't be able to show my sincerity until I came here.

341
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,300
Yoshi-kun, I'm glad! It's Shoji! Shoji will do it for you!

343
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Huh? Shoji?

344
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Okay, I'll call him.

345
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Please, Shoji.

346
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Please, Shoji.

347
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Please give it to him.

348
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Okay, I've called him. I'm sorry.

349
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Yoshi-kun, I'm ready.

350
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm so happy!

351
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
It's amazing.

352
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
I want to do it.

353
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Oh, interesting.

354
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
What is this?

355
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I don't know.

356
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
I always do this, but what is this?

357
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
It's like a simple exercise.

358
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
You're pumped up.

359
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm pumped up.

360
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Let's see.

361
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,300
There are many Papi-Pu-Pepos in the world.

362
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
The Papi-Pu-Pepo of the vertical.

363
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Papi-Pu-Pepo of the vertical.

364
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Oh, fast.

365
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm really happy.

366
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Papi-Pu-Pepo of the horizontal.

367
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Papi-Pu-Pepo of the vertical.

368
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Not at all.

370
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Thank you.

371
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Good job.

372
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Are you okay?

373
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm fine.

374
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
It's not like this.

375
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
From here...

376
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,980
The challenge is quite different like seeing a picture

377
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm laughing

378
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,000
易3

379
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,500
Look Leslie pjiang is opening

380
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,640
An same blue

381
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
It's coming out a little.

382
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
A little more.

383
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Keep going.

384
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Keep going.

385
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
You can do it!

386
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
You can do it!

387
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Edo! Edo!

388
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Edo!

389
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Wait! Wait!

390
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Wait!

391
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:59,700
Destroying the

392
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
That was amazing!

393
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
That was so much fun!

394
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Thank you! Thank you!

395
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
It's finally happening!

396
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
It's been a while since we've had a talk like this.

397
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Really?

398
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
It's been a while, but you still haven't had a good time.

399
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,700
There were some games that were really bad.

400
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
There were a lot of games.

401
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Well, it doesn't matter.

402
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
What?

403
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
My license...

404
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm sorry for saying it so casually.

405
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
No, no, I was just saying it.

406
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
It's okay.

407
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
It's not that bad.

408
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I'll tell you now, but the other day, on October 10th, there was a rumor that there was a big earthquake.

409
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
There was.

410
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Oh, you know about it?

411
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
I do.

412
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Why do you know about it?

413
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Did you know?

414
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
It's true.

415
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,200
I left to Nagoya right after work.

416
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
That's...

417
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
That's... No!

418
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,700
I was in the army.

419
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,200
I left in a hurry.

420
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
What the hell?

421
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
You ran away?

422
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,700
No, no, no.

423
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,200
It's true.

424
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I went to the store.

425
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:25,200
I was so excited that day, I was so excited that I couldn't run away.

426
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I jumped off the train from Shinagawa.

427
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,200
And you were left there, right?

428
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
When you entered the tunnel, it was dark, right?

429
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
You suddenly moved, right?

430
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
You were smiling.

431
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I was laughing behind you!

432
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I was just saying it.

433
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Well, well, you know.

434
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Well, well, Koka, Fukuoka.

435
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I thought, if it was a little bit shaky, it would be a joke.

436
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,200
In the end, I was back on the 10th at the last minute, as close as possible to 12 o'clock.

437
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
So, I arrived in Tokyo at 11.40.

438
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I thought, if I came in these 20 minutes, I would really be done.

439
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I was surprised when I heard that.

440
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I get angry when I think too much about safety.

441
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
What do you mean?

442
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
For example, there is a function that is not necessary even in a car.

443
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I can't forgive it.

444
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
If I drive a little, it will be locked.

445
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Do you need that?

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Why?

447
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
The car before didn't have that.

448
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
So I bought a new one.

449
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
And I bought a new one.

450
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,200
And when I started to run, I heard a bang bang.

451
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
That's good, that's rock.

452
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
But I don't remember doing rock for 10 years.

453
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I stopped and met people.

454
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
People came from over there.

455
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
And when they came, they were like,

456
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Gah! Gah!

457
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Outside.

458
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
So you were not doing rock?

459
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I don't remember doing rock, so I was like, Gah!

460
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I thought, oh, I see.

461
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
And they were like, bang bang.

462
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Bang bang bang bang!

463
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
The other side, too, was like, BAKU BAKU!

464
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
BAKU BAKU!

465
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
And I was like,

466
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Wait! Wait!

467
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I was like that.

468
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
But it was closed, so I was like,

469
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
BAKU BAKU!

470
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
And when I opened it,

471
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
It was open!

472
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
It was open!

473
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I couldn't hear anything,

474
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
So the window was like, BAKU BAKU!

475
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
It was open!

476
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,200
That's not the case every time.

477
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
It's almost every time.

478
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I was really angry.

479
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I don't want to do that anymore.

480
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Child something.

481
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
There is a child something.

482
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Child rock.

483
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Child rock.

484
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I don't want to do that anymore.

485
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I don't want to.

486
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I don't understand.

487
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
If you put out a car wash,

488
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
If you open the door,

489
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It's around here.

490
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,200
When I took out my car, my brother was pushing the switch.

491
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I don't remember what he said.

492
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
There was a junior in the back.

493
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I said, I got it.

494
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
He said, I won't open it.

495
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
You have to open it from the outside.

496
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I usually escort juniors.

497
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Why am I a junior?

498
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
All cars are like that now.

499
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
All of them are like that.

500
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Navi is Navi.

501
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,200
From here on is important, but after that it's like searching for yourself.

502
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
That's not true.

503
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
There are times when you can get an ending.

504
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
That's not true.

505
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
After that it's like, look at the map.

506
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Shut up.

507
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
There's something like that.

508
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
There's nothing like that.

509
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
When I went to Okinawa the other day,

510
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I asked a used car for rent.

511
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
A cheap used car.

512
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
It's the one I put on after that.

513
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Navigation?

514
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Navigation.

515
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
It's different now.

516
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
It's from when it came out.

517
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
The image is not as beautiful as it is now.

518
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
It's like the Invader era.

519
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
It's a bit greenish.

520
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
It's a liquid crystal ball.

521
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Where are you running?

522
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
It's like that.

523
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm talking, but it's old.

524
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Somehow...

525
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Turn left.

526
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
No, I'm not that stupid!

527
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
You're really scary!

528
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
What are you talking about?

529
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
You're right-handed!

530
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,460
That's hot!

531
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,020
Mo Third�о's edited!

532
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
Thank you.
