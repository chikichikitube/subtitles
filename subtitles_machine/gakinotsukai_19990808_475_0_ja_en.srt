1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next match is En-do vs Guts.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Kogon Tozai.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The store name of the convenience store.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ready.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Lawson.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Seven... Seven Eleven.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
AMPM.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Jona-san.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes!

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, start.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is...

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's like something that happens in a general house.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
After this, Guts is still not correct.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In a flash, he reaches the fourth question.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is amazing.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's amazing.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a title match.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Japanese Prime Minister of the past.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ready!

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hara Kei.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ito Hirofumi.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Kaifu.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going!

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mom, please stand over here.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Wasewasa, go over there.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Seiki, Seiki.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, do your best.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then why did you stop twice?

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right, I can't do it.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm the one who should stop.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you ready?

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please, J.K.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, J.K.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, me.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Please, J.K.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What?

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll go first.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll go first!

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go first!

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hamada-san, you go first!

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hamada-san, you go first!

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The first one is...

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The name of the state in America.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's good.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's easier!

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's easier, isn't it?

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's Hamada!

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Say more!

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't know that!

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know that!

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's easier!

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's actually easier.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You guys are so dumb!

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Speaking of summer's seasonings...

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Hamada, please.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Watermelon.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Windmill.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What about us?

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ice strawberry.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Wait a minute.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You don't say that?

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, no, the ice is my...

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,860
My

85
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
I'll be in the Kourin series from now on.

86
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
I have a lot of friends.

87
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
I wish I could find a series.

88
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
That's right, Katsuo-san.

89
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
I see.

90
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
I always talk about it.

91
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
I see.

92
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Yoyo Tsuri.

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Yoyo Tsuri.

94
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Ok, it's a book store.

95
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
There is a book store.

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
I said OK.

97
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,860
You are so mean to the talent.

98
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,860
OK.

99
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
OK, Mr. Matsumoto.

100
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Super Bowl Tsuri.

101
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
Hey!

102
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,860
OK.

103
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,860
OK.

104
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
Safe.

105
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,860
Safe.

106
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,860
The shaved ice is just the smell of strawberry and lemon.

107
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,860
There is a reading rule.

108
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,860
Yes.

109
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Mr. Matsumoto.

110
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,860
Tube.

111
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
Oh!

112
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
Oh!

113
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,860
It's coming!

114
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Okay!

115
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Eh...

116
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,860
Sadan!

117
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,860
Wait a minute!

118
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,860
You said Sadan!

119
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
That's not right!

120
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
Ah, Sadan is not good!

121
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
The tube is a bit...

122
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
What?

123
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,860
What?

124
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,860
What?

125
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,860
What?

126
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,860
What?

127
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
What?

128
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
What?

129
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
What?

130
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
What?

131
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
What?

132
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
What?

133
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
What?

134
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
What?

135
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
What?

136
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,860
What?

137
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
What?

138
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Please, please, please, please, please, please!

139
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Out!

140
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
You guys are really annoying!

141
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,860
Hey, come on, come on, come on!

142
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
Yeah, come on!

143
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Here we go!

144
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,860
The second question is...

145
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
Guts-san will be the one to answer.

146
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,860
The world champion of boxing history.

147
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
Start!

148
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,860
Guts Ishimatsu.

149
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
That's right.

150
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
I'm laughing, so I'll just say it.

151
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Pim-pom!

153
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
Pim-pom!

154
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Toka-chan.

155
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Pim-pom!

156
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
What is the correct way to say Toka-chan?

157
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Tokashiki Katsuo!

158
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Tokashiki Katsuo!

159
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
Fighting Harada!

160
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,860
Pim-pom!

161
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Piston Horiguchi!

162
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Boo!

163
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
And...

164
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
It's over!

165
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Thank you.

166
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Why do you look so sad?

167
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
The third question.

168
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,860
The name of the talent who has been in the east, west, south and north for a long time.

169
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
Kitajima Saburo.

170
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
Minami Kousetsu.

171
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,860
Minami Haruo.

172
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Minami is in it.

173
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Minami is different from Minami.

174
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Oh!

175
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Oh!

176
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Oh!

177
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Oh!

178
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
OK, OK.

179
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
It was a good show.

180
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Thank you.

181
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Let's go to the next one.

182
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Tokyo, 23 districts.

183
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860

187
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Edogawa-kun.

188
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Pimpo.

189
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860

2.

193
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
1.

194
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
What?

195
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
What is this?

196
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
What?

197
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
What is this?

198
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
What?

199
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
What?

200
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
What?

201
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
What?

202
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
What?

203
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
What is this?

204
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Hey! Hey!

205
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
What is this?

206
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Here it comes.

207
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Here it comes.

208
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Here it comes.

209
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
Let's go.

210
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Let's go.

211
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Should we say four letters?

212
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Then, from Matsuboshi-san, go ahead.

213
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Eh, Sessa Takuma.

214
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Oh.

215
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Ichigoichi.

216
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Eh, Baji Tofu.

217
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Eh,

218
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
What was it?

219
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Shochiku Bai.

220
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
Yeah!

221
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,860
Thank you!

222
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Thank you!

223
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I'm not going to do it!

224
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Please go to the first round!

225
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
It's D1!

226
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
Hamada-san, D1!

227
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Can you move a little bit to the side?

228
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
A little bit more.

229
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Face the front.

230
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
Scary!

231
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,860
You won't be able to break the sunken glass.

232
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Let's go with the names of the couple.

233
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Well, that is...

234
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Sonomama-san and Kato Kazuko-san.

235
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Yes.

236
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
Well...

237
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Ikue-chan and...

238
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
No, not Kato.

239
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Watanabe Toru-san and...

240
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
Yes.

241
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Nagato Hiroyuki and Minamida Yoko.

242
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Oh!

243
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
He knows a lot about that!

244
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Who would do that?

245
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
There are still a lot of people.

246
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Well, well, well, OK.

247
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Why did you get caught by that?

248
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,860
You're not allowed to get caught!

249
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,860
You're done!

250
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Out!

251
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,860
That was a good one.

252
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,860
That was a good one.

253
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,860
That was a good one.

254
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,860
That was a good one.

255
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
You're still here.

256
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
Okay, last one.

257
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Not yet.

258
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
You're still not ready.

259
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Not yet.

260
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
You're still not ready.

261
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm trying to do it.

262
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
You're still not ready.

263
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,860
I'm trying to do it.

264
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
You're still not ready.

265
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Masato-san, Kounin!

266
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,860
The name of the person who was on the Choja Banzuke in 1999!

267
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Best 10!

268
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
How is it?

269
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Ah, then...

270
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Hamada Masatoshi

271
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Yes, that's right

272
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
The one next to me

273
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860
The one next to you, that was included too

274
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
What kind of way is that?

275
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

276
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

277
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

278
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Um, Ishibashi Takahaki.

279
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Yes.

280
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
I don't know from there.

281
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
But I don't know from there.

282
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
I don't know from there.

283
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Well, it's a lie.

284
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
There are seven more.

285
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Well, that's not an example.

286
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
An example?

287
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Let's go.

288
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
What do you do with an example?

289
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Please stand up.

290
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Um, Akashiya-san.

291
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,360
Eh?

292
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
It's not in!

293
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Ahhhh!

294
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
No!

295
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Thank you!

296
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
No!

297
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
It's not in!

298
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
It's not in!

299
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
It's in!

300
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
It's not in!

301
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
It's not in!

302
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
It's not in!

303
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
It's not in!

304
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
No, it's not in!

305
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
It's just a little bit in!

306
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Now!

307
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
Mr. Tanaka!

308
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,000
I strong

309
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,040
веро Nee

310
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,060
Takahashi

311
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,200
Make come

312
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,180
The There

313
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,620
Sak revealed

314
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,680
Kirby

315
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,180
Yamaguchi

316
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,000
видео

317
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm so tired!

318
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm so tired!

319
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm so tired!

320
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm so tired!

321
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm so tired!

322
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hamada, did you gain more weight?

323
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yo, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

324
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The innkeeper is a good friend.

325
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We always drink together.

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The innkeeper's wife.

327
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The innkeeper's wife.

328
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The night is a dark inn.

329
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Ha ha!

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The next day

331
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let me introduce you to Seiro-kun

332
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He's not that popular but you're also black

333
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not that popular, you shouldn't think about me

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm a summer holiday

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm not working at all!

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're not thinking!

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're a fool! You've been on a trip twice!

338
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, I was in Okinawa for a while.

339
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So you were in Okinawa before that?

340
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, I was working in Okinawa.

341
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I had no choice but to go to work.

342
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

343
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's fine.

344
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You were in Guam?

345
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was in Guam.

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
People who have been on this channel will be surprised!

347
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What are you talking about?

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Probably the darkest combination in Japan.

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, well...

350
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, for now.

351
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
With the collar too.

352
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's funny.

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But in Okinawa, you wore a typhoon, didn't you?

354
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I wore a typhoon. You wore a typhoon.

355
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And then, what was it...

356
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
For about two days, something terrible happened.

357
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

358
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It was like a festival.

359
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Rain and wind.

360
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It was like a whirlwind.

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I was wondering how strong the wind was.

362
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I thought I would slip and fall down.

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have a weird back.

364
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I can't help it.

365
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I was like,

366
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't do that.

367
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You know, you didn't do the earth's work.

368
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're so bad at this.

369
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're not even good at it.

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

371
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're so noisy. You're scary.

372
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can't do that.

373
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, I can't do it if my blood pressure changes.

374
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What's that?

375
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I get on the plane, I'll get a fever.

376
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, really?

377
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No, no.

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're saying that.

379
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're scared, right?

380
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I was in Okinawa and I was taken to a place called Hakunijima.

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was put on a plane and it was really small.

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I got on it suddenly.

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What does it mean to get on it suddenly?

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was like this.

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have been on a plane with 6 people.

386
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You are a woman who has been on a plane with 6 people.

387
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
It's like you said.

388
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
You're kidding me!

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When I got on the plane, you said you were scared.

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I thought you would definitely be scared.

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because the captain would hand me a towel.

392
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Behind me.

393
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was like, what the hell?

394
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
The passengers would hand me a towel.

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's right.

396
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't have a towel.

397
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm a person who treats people with kindness.

398
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I was so scared of that thing!

399
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But it's fine, you've experienced it, right?

400
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm laughing, but usually, when there's a big plane, they say,

401
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Turn the door mode on.

402
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's just a voice, but there's no way the door mode would go off.

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I thought I had to say something, but I thought,

404
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What should I say?

405
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I turned from the right propeller.

406
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I told the audience about it.

407
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, really? I turned.

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was looking right.

409
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I looked left. I turned left.

410
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I went back and forth.

411
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was burned like a local old man.

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I felt like a man who was wrapped in a towel.

413
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I was wearing this and that when I was in Nankai.

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I explained the situation to the stewardess and the old man went back.

415
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I said, I'll go around from the right propeller.

416
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll go around from the right propeller because I'm in a good mood today.

417
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't say anything.

418
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why did you put it on?

419
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I didn't say anything at first because I was in a good mood.

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What is this?

421
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I thought I could do it, so I took it off.

422
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I thought I should say left, but I think it's better to say right.

423
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How many days did you go?

424
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
About 4 days.

425
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Ah, 4 days.

426
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, 4 days is the best.

427
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

428
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not like it's cut off.

429
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm taking videos from far away.

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes, yes, yes.

431
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
How many times did it cut off?

432
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But I'm more angry at the fact that she's so far away from me.

433
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's the thing I want you to stop the most.

434
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's a first-class thing in Tokyo.

435
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a first-class thing.

436
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you go to a place like that, I don't think you should stay still.

437
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
No matter how many times I go, the old lady in Osaka is the most powerful.

438
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In Osaka, in the whole world, all over the world.

439
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That old lady in Osaka is...

440
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
She's powerful.

441
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Did you go there?

442
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes, I did.

443
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I slipped on the mat.

444
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You were wearing a swimsuit.

445
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I slipped on the long mat.

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't understand.

447
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There was a swimming pool.

448
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There was a Tartar.

449
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It wasn't Tartar.

450
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't think so.

451
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There was another one.

452
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There was another one.

453
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was like, whoaaaa!

454
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then, I took a picture of the old lady.

455
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I was doing the video.

456
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And then, I took a picture of the old lady.

457
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
At that time, you were so excited?

458
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I was like, this is so funny!

459
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I thought I should run and run again and take a picture of her.

460
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I was doing it all the time.

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
She was obviously taking a picture of me.

462
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I was like, excuse me.

463
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was like, excuse me.

464
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But the worst thing is that I have no children.

465
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
When I look at my bag, I have no one!

466
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What the hell is this?

467
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is what I look like.

468
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Right?

469
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Really.

470
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

471
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Really.

472
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What is that?

473
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I was taken this kind of face.

474
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I remembered that, but it was still funny.

475
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There's a guy like that, a slider. He's always so excited.

476
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He's like, Mr. Matsumoto, you go this way, I'll go this way.

477
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Let's see who's faster!

478
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And then he goes,

479
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When he goes,

480
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
His head goes like this.

481
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
When I came out, I was like this.

482
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was very excited.

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is a Soba-don, so I bought it!

484
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm angry.

485
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What are you angry about?

486
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm angry.

487
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,500
I'm sorry.

488
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
It's your fault.

489
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's my fault.

490
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This pool is so hot.

491
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What kind of way do you use to hit here?

492
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know.

493
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know.

494
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Marimo was playing and he said,

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That was painful.

496
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It was scary.

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And he was really scared.

498
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Was it this kind of face?

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What?

500
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're making it sound like a movie.

501
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
As the winner, I have a question for you, Mr. Matsumoto.

502
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
In pro baseball, the coach often goes to the referee's decision and leaves.

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
How do you decide whether the referee will let you leave or not?

504
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I see.

505
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There are people who often get hit in the shoulder.

506
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What about that?

507
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If the judge thinks it hurts, he will be released.

508
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If the judge thinks it hurts when he hits you with his shoulder, will you be released?

509
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You will be released.

510
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What if he hits you with his shoulder?

511
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Can you hit him with your shoulder?

512
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You tell me.

513
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Please try to hit my face.

514
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,020
I'll show you just for your own good.

515
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
What the hell is that?

516
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
What the hell is that?

517
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,020
What is that?

518
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
For example, if you say, I'm the one who did it!

519
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm the one who did it!

520
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
You're saying that, right?

521
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
I'm the one who did it!

522
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,020
If you say that, you can't be released.

523
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020
If you touch it like this...

524
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
This is...

525
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,020
This is not for you...

526
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
Stop it!

527
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
But you're the one who did it!

528
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,020
What are you doing?

529
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
What are you doing?

530
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm doing it!

531
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,020
So, if you feel pain...

532
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Pain is absolutely no good.

533
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,020
So, you're going to be discharged from the hospital if you make fun of me?

534
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
Making fun of you?

535
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Judgment.

536
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Judgment?

537
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Isn't that a possibility?

538
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,020
For example, if you approach me like this...

539
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
What's that black thing?

540
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,020
That's not something you can laugh about and keep laughing about.

541
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
What is it?

542
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Something like this.

543
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,020
That's not something you can do and keep laughing about.

544
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
But I've been doing it all this time.

545
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,020
From the front of the second floor to the back of the eighth floor.

546
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
I can't fight anymore.

547
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
I'm told to go back to the bench.

548
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
I'm doing it even if I go back to the toilet.

549
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
I don't care about that.

550
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,020
This is a question for Matsumoto-san who is going to be 500 years old soon.

551
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,020
Please tell us your impressions of the battle at Sekigahara.

552
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
I was nervous.

553
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Hey, hey!

554
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,020
Before it started.

555
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
That's funny.

556
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,020
I was nervous before it started.

557
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,020
I was so excited.

558
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
When it started,

559
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
It's not like that.

560
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I was already excited.

561
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
I was already excited.

562
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
I was like,

563
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Waaaaaaah!

564
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
But before it started,

565
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,020
Before it started,

566
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
I knew it was going to be like that.

567
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,020
What kind of story?

568
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,020
I was told to wait a little bit more for the setting.

569
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,020
Which one is it?

570
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,020
No, I was waiting.

571
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Which one is it?

572
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
But it's like this.

573
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
It's like the story of the Seki girl.

574
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
I don't know.

575
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
We are in trouble.

576
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
No, no, no.

577
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
No, no, no.

578
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
What is it?

579
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
How was it?

580
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
How was it?

581
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,020
In the end, there were so many people that we had to fight.

582
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
The battle at Sekigahara was amazing.

583
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,020
I thought, this will be remembered in history.

584
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
Really?

585
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,020
When I heard the sound of the gun, I thought, this will be remembered in history.

586
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,020
Who did you tell that to?

587
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
I told him I knew him.

588
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
You were friends?

589
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Yes, we were friends.

590
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
We were in the same school.

591
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,020
Oh, I see.

592
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,020
I asked him how he was doing.

593
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
He said he was nervous.

594
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
I told him I was nervous.

595
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
We became friends.

596
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
He said, wow.

597
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
He was also pushing me.

598
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
I'm done.

599
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
This is a historical document.
