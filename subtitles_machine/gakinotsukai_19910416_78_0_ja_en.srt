1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chikitsuki Forest Project!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is the Demon King asleep?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You should be more motivated from the opening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's just a movie.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Even if it's a late night show, it's not like that.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's not like that.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a dodgeball match between 500 people vs 500 people.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How much time does it take to dodgeball?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's from a viewer.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Miki Satoru.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Miki Satoru from Hachioji City.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to give him a T-shirt.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't do that.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know if Satoru will give me a T-shirt or not.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll be in a bad mood.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't do it.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll do it.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll do it.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know what's going on.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Next, Lotte Kawasaki Stadium.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why do we have to meet Lotte?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a human dominos tournament.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What are we going to do?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Are we going to line up?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then we'll go one by one.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's dangerous.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're going to show that to the Laffy Nose.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's scary.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've already forgotten.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Next, 1000 people home drama.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What about this?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There's a drama with 1000 people?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There are already about 30 fathers.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The one who plays the father?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The one who plays the father is already 30.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The one who plays the mother is 50.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you don't do that, there won't be 1000 people.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think it's going to be fun.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's going to be fun.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Next.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's call the UFO.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's call the UFO.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So we're all going to call the UFO?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The way to call the UFO.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How do you call it?

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't know if it's going to be a gong show.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's do it without expectations.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you don't do it, you'll be disqualified.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's a stupid thing.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If 1000 people do it over and over again,

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the aliens will bring garbage and do it.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's call the UFO.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's call the UFO.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's better not to see it.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's make a promotion video.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm participating in 1000 people.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We've been doing a lot of things in the world.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We've been doing a lot of things for 10 years.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
At the end, 1000 people will make fun of us.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The ending song that Mr. Yami Ozaki told me about will play in the back.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I see.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Depending on the script, I think I can take it off.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If it's necessary?

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If it's this work?

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think it's okay to look at it at the end.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's 10 years, right?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
About once.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Last.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Put your butt out.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I say that if you put your butt out, it will be a mountain.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you put your butt out, it will smell like the poop of a streamer.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can't smell it with a streamer.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If there are 1000 people.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's get rid of what we don't need.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's get rid of what we don't need.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is a little better.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is a little better.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's dangerous.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know what this means either.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's dangerous to walk.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What about this?

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Should I leave this?

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Leave it.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How many cents do you have?

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's like a piece of sense.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's like a promotion.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is a little expensive.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is expensive.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes, it's expensive.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't throw this away either.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It will cost money.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Certainly, it will cost money.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't get rid of it with this.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why can't you get rid of it with this?

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is also expensive.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a big deal, isn't it?

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't enter the stadium.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can't ask people to give me money.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's 1000 yen for 500 yen, isn't it?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can't do that.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You want to eat grilled squid, don't you?

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's my money.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's why I can't do that.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Come on.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
One drink, one food.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Which of these two?

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This one seems to be more exciting.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is not exciting.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's like putting out your butt and saying,

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey, it's over.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's right.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't have such an interesting butt.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't have such an interesting butt.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That means.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go with this.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A dodgeball match between 500 people and 500 people.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is the guy who lost.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's fine.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But women can't enter the stadium.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's right.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What are you going to do?

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't be funny.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a penalty game that women can play.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's a penalty game that 1000 people can play.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Right on the spot.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a penalty game that 500 people can play.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a penalty game that 500 people can play.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't want to cry.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now that we've wasted some time,

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
let's play with 1000 people.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's play with 1000 people.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why do you want to play with 1000 people?

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Look, I'm Lupin-san.

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How many times have you seen this kid?

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm Lupin-san.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you do this normally,

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm Lupin-san.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's totally like Lupin.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you mean?

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's like putting out your butt and saying,

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey, it's over.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's right.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's right.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you okay?

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hello.

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hello.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Excuse me.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's something happening in the program.

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a little late, isn't it?

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This guy, Shomei-san, is a girl,

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but he fell from the stairs.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, no, no.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I was really surprised by that.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, no, no.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What is it?

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What is it?

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm not surprised.

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You know, he always has a camera here

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
before he comes out.

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's taking pictures with his sleeves.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, before he comes out.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And Shomei-san is a girl,

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and he's doing this with both hands.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I said,

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yuruya, I'm going to squeeze you.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why are you saying that?

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why are you squeezing me?

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She's illuminating you.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yuruya, you're a moon.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's the sun!

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He fell down the stairs.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We were like, are you ok?

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And he was like...

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That was so sad.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did he spin once?

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Where did he go?

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Poor guy.

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sorry.

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:04,640
Then the

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Seiri left for a while again.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Idiot!

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He did a triple spin!

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Giiiin-chan!

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Gin-chan!

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why?

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why?

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yasuka!

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't do this anymore.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What?

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have to show your warm side.

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't care about my warm side.

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What do you mean?

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You always show your warm side.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where do I show my warm side?

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hey!

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I did my best.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You'll go home soon, right?

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes, I'll go home soon.

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll stay until the end.

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll shake hands with everyone.

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No matter how many times you do it,

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
if you do it once, you'll be late.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you do it three times, you'll be late.

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If I do it again, you won't show your affection?

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If I do it again, you won't show your affection?

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You won't show your affection?

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hey!

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Sorry, it was my fault.

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was your fault.

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I showed my affection.

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You showed your affection.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The other day, I didn't do much,

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I don't like gambling,

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but for the first time in a long time,

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I won a lottery.

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was a big lottery.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It was a big lottery.

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There was good information.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, there were two,

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but I won 50,000 yen each.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, yes, yes.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're a fool, aren't you?

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is what happened yesterday.

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In the end, I did it all.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I won 3 million yen.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's 23 million yen!

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey!

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hey, are you late?

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll call you.

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It seems that there is a way to understand something.

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have a little bit of foresight.

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't you?

246
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can't say that you're a fool.

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, no, I really have a little bit of foresight.

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I live in the tower of Babylon.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're a fool.

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No, no, I really have a little bit of foresight.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I have a little bit of foresight.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Everyone has a little bit of foresight.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Has anything happened so far?

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There was a time when I ate a little too much.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No!

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm getting fat!

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You know that, don't you?

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I have a little bit of foresight.

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Does your previous life know anything about you?

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, me? I don't know anything about me.

261
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I was wondering if you knew anything about me.

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I know about your teacher.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Aoki sensei.

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know anything about you.

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't care about this.

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's just a little thing.

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Everyone thinks that humans are the best.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But humans are not the best.

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't you think so?

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is there anything better than humans?

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know. Try it.

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I just don't know.

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There must be more fun animals.

274
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm just flying high.

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It feels so good.

276
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I feel like I'm having sex all the time.

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can't stand it. It feels so good.

278
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Sometimes I get stuck in shit.

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't stand it.

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It feels so good.

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's all I can think of.

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For example, crying.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is what God decided.

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He gathered all these animals.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't talk to you.

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why? Why?

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why? Why?

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why? Why?

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why? Why?

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wait, wait.

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't be in a hurry.

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why? Why?

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Wait, wait.

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't run away.

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're going to be called a cheater.

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm not going to run away.

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I thought about it.

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to make you cry.

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What? What?

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What about me?

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can decide for yourself.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
First of all, I'm going to have a dog.

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You should have said that.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry, but I don't let anyone have a dog.

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm going to have a dog.

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The one who says the most is the winner.

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's enough.

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You have a dog.

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm going back.

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Run away!

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Who is it?

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's me.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A cat came out.

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
A cat came out.

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Everyone decided for themselves.

316
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Who are you?

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm an elephant.

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm the elephant.

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There was a guy in the book who was bullied.

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What are you going to do?

321
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hurry up and decide.

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We don't have time.

323
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Everyone decided for themselves.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you going to do?

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can't do anything about it.

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think humans still have something.

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But humans may be able to fly.

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There may be some kind of code.

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No one has found it.

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you do it three times, you may be able to fly.

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But you haven't flown so far.

332
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't you want to fly?

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It would be nice if I could fly.

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's natural.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How nice would it be if a comedian could fly?

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't you think so?

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If you fly when you fall, you'll get hit.

338
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It would be interesting to use that way.

339
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It would be interesting.

340
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
My prediction is right.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You haven't said it yet.

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Make a prediction.

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
For example, I know when the earthquake will come.

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What's the magnitude?

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Magnitude.

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What?

347
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's magnitude.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's called magnitude.

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's coming.

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How big is it?

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's as big as a disaster.

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's great.

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The Earth is in trouble.

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you noticed, there was an Eskimo sitting next to it.

355
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's terrible.

356
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's terrible.

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't know much about it.

358
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The Eskimo is here.

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The Eskimo is here.

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What is it?

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The Eskimo is here.

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't understand one word.

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry. I didn't study enough.

364
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What is Eskime?

365
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Eskimo, Eskime, Osukime.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You said it.

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hello.

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you from Ippan today?

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm a girl from Ippan.

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Her name is Eri Kobayashi.

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
She is 21 years old.

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She is from Aichi Prefecture.

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What are you doing now?

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you unemployed?

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No.

376
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I went to Eikawara School.

377
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Eikawara School?

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let me talk to her.

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

380
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let me talk to her.

381
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let me speak in English.

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
How are you?

383
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm fine. Thank you.

384
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You are quite successful.

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Where?

386
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you very much.

387
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you.

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I received this.

389
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This is a message from a person who is a double matcha poop.

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
A guest from the first or second time of the program, which was broadcasted on TV from 12 o'clock on Saturday night,

391
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
was on the show.

392
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We were on the show.

393
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
My acquaintance is a member of that program.

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He said this about the program.

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They are very rude,

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and they are both late.

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They are not good.

398
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Do the staff of the program think the same way?

399
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you think so?

400
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you think so, Saku?

401
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Be more polite.

402
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I do.

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I do.

404
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You should never make a mistake in your greeting.

405
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What?

406
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You should never make a mistake in your greeting.

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Is that so?

408
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
First, look at the person.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
When you look at the person,

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
you should analyze the person in your head.

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You are a robot.

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You can see the person.

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You should not make a mistake in your greeting.

414
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's right.

415
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You should make a mistake in your greeting.

416
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You should say,

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You are my friend.

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You should not make a mistake in your greeting.

419
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You should have the energy of a friend.

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You should not make a mistake in your greeting.

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Do you use that energy?

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Of course.

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
For example,

424
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you should say hello to a friend.

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You should say hello to the guy who is a double matcha poop.

426
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right.

427
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Really?

428
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's right.

429
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
In Otomo version.

430
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Otomo.

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm AD Otomo.

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm analyzing now.

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Good morning, Otomo.

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Did you say that once?

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Good morning, Otomo.

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Next.

437
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's normal.

438
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Who's next?

439
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Saito, our chief director.

440
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's AD Otomo.

441
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's because he's the chief director.

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Good morning, Saito.

443
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Did you say that once?

444
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't pull even one page with one piece of paper.

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Let's go.

446
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's a bit long today.

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I love Yamazaki from Team Zero.

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He's cool no matter what he says.

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't you think he's fashionable?

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Please give him more opportunities to appear on TV.

451
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Please.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Please.

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's what he said.

454
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Really?

455
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He moved recently.

456
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's amazing.

457
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I was surprised when I went to see him once.

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There's a road like this.

459
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's a road like this.

460
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When the road is like this, there's a door here.

461
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is the room.

462
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's because there's a staircase next to the road.

463
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No, it's just a door.

464
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So be careful when you sleep at home.

465
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
There's a car running.

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There's no fence or anything.

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, no, no.

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Really?

469
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Only the window is big.

470
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The one on the back?

471
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No, not the back.

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There's a big window here.

473
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Next to the door?

474
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's transparent.

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you go in there...

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It can't be transparent.

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's transparent.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Really?

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's transparent.

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He doesn't have money, so he doesn't have a curtain.

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You can't see anything.

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's right.

483
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When he stopped and tried to think,

484
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I thought he was a mannequin.

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I thought he was a show window.

486
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He came to me like, where are you?

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Now, let's go to the Yamazaki house.

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's go to Yamazaki house with the kids.

489
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll laugh.

490
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yamazaki house home tour.

491
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Home tour.

492
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll laugh.

493
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll be surprised.

494
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Anyway, that's it for today.

495
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's right.

496
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's enough.

497
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's enough.

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you doing?

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Do some Japanese dance.

500
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What?

501
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Japanese dance.

502
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You...

503
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Japanese dance...

504
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You do it.

505
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Japanese dance.

506
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Do some jazz dance.

507
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you want?

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Jazz dance.

509
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What do you want?

510
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What?

511
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
When I entered Yoshimoto, I was told to do jazz dance.

512
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Jazz dance?

513
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

514
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's strange.

515
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can do this and that.

516
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes.

517
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Do it with switch.

518
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You...

519
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Why do you do this?

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I did it.

521
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I did it.

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Do you know why I do this?

523
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's like that.

524
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This is...

525
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ah!

526
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This is...

527
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes.

528
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This has a seed.

529
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes.

530
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's like that.

531
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's like that.

532
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's made like that.

533
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Does it stick all the time?

534
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes.

535
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Ah, it didn't come today.

536
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's off today.

537
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's off today.

538
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, it stuck.

539
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It stuck.

540
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It stuck.

541
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Wait a minute.

542
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It was late.

543
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Wait a minute.

544
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This is a bean ball.

545
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll put it in here.

546
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Wait a minute.

547
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Wait.

548
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What?

549
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You...

550
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Does it stick all the time?

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You shouldn't do that.

552
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What are you talking about?

553
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Do it.

554
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Everyone, you should cooperate.

555
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Cooperate with this guy.

556
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I see.

557
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This guy...

558
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This guy was a bean ball.

559
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If this guy comes off, everyone will be in trouble.

560
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes.

561
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What?

562
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you understand?

563
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Hello.

564
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hello.

565
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Masato-kun.

566
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You asked me to give you a T-shirt.

567
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I wrote this for a week.

568
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes.

569
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I took a look at it.

570
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
There's a girl who wants this.

571
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, really?

572
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you can draw so beautifully,

573
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you should draw on a white T-shirt.

574
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You should make it yourself.

575
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's enough.

576
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I did it at the opening.

577
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
1000 people.

578
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's an event.

579
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
500 people versus 500 people.

580
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's a dodgeball.

581
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's right.

582
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's an event, but the place is decided.

583
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The girl is a goalkeeper.

584
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll give you a Hachimaki.

585
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, Mach-chan, Jimu, Hama-chan.

586
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's right.

587
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What about the guy?

588
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll give you a jersey.

589
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's good.

590
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The girl is definitely a goalkeeper.

591
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes.

592
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Nice to meet you.

593
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The assistant is my person.

594
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's all the same.

595
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The place of the dodgeball is decided.

596
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The losing team has to play a penalty game.

597
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll tell you what the penalty game is later.

598
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's it.

599
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Hachimaki is the most important thing.

600
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you for watching.
