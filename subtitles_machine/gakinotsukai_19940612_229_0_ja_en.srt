00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening. I'm a kid's teacher.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Actually, I have something to tell you.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hamada-kun is off today.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Why?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well...

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's a TV show.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not sure if I can play a full match.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I want to play baseball.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Baseball?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Baseball?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Baseball?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Baseball?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What are you doing, Hamada-kun?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Shut up!

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So...

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Did you do your job?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, I didn't.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What are you?

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I didn't do my job.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You didn't?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shut up!

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Shut up!

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Shut up!

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Shut up!

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Shut up!

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Shut up!

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Shut up!

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I have to do something for the show.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm off today.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Today, we had a lot of guests.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What are you doing?

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We had a lot of guests.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll show you my skills.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll show you my skills.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll show you my skills.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know if I can show you everything.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Please watch it.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Start!

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Turn the video around!

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please watch it.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're in the way!

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I haven't done any sports in the opening.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
First of all, NAMIKI PRO.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Good evening.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is the commentator.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the commentator.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is the commentator.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't like it.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's wrong with you?

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Is that a real ball?

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't do that.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm the host of Shiki Shiki Manga Dojo.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm the host, Hamada Masato.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the host, Hamada Masato.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Please draw a circle with a hot spring mark.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
First of all, Ebisu.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is a kappa.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The sun is shining on my head.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is a kappa.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is a kappa.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you scared?

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a round sushi.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I drew a round sushi.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I drew a round sushi.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I drew a round sushi.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I drew a round sushi.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm a foolish boy.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A light woman.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, it's something that spins.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's something that spins in Harappa.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good!

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That was amazing.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I went to the Olympics.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It hurts.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, that's it, a wide balance.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're not there yet.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's it, a big jump.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A full turn.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Get it!

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Spin, spin, spin.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I did it!

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've been planning this for a long time.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But I couldn't get their schedule.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We have a great guest.

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's good.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's have him on stage.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yamada Yasuo and Negoro!

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you serious?

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No, I'm not.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I had nothing to do.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's a lie.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not going to let you go.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's good.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's a nostalgic song.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's nostalgic.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard that you were sent to the middle of Shinshu 5 years ago.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If there's a paper to throw away, there's a paper to pick up.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Read it.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There's information that Lupin 3rd is going to join the Sarlowin Association.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So we want to arrest Lupin 3rd with your help.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's also an arrest warrant for Interpol.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Lupin 3rd, I'm counting on you.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Lupin? Are you really Lupin?

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm Yamada Yasuo.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Good evening.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We're going to have a first class English class.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's in English, right?

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's in English.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's the best pattern I've ever done.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Excuse me.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Mr. Kento Teikaku!

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mr. Kento Teikaku

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mr. Kento Teikaku, how are you doing? It's so nice to see you again.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I haven't seen you since that party. Where was it?

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That was a great party.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I can't believe it.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was great.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When did you start talking?

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's start the class.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Kento, look at this.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll do this.

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you do this in English?

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Laura!

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's Japanese!

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's Laura!

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is this Mr. Saejoh Hideki?

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is how you do it.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't use Japanese.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, come on!

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
How many people are there?

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There are six of us.

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We have two guests.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
First, we have Mr. Amikoshi.

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're doing great, Mr. Amikoshi.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not saying anything weird.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Next, we have Mrs. Komori.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you still have a crush on her?

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I have a crush on her now.

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How about you, Mr. Amikoshi?

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mr. Amikoshi doesn't call people like Mrs. Komori.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mrs. Komori doesn't call people like Mr. Amikoshi either.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's not like that.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's get along.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't want to do this anymore.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you doing?

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're annoying.

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't want to do this anymore.

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're annoying.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is the hide-and-seek show.

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There was an unexpected twist.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't think she'd be in the bathroom.

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is the first time she's been in the men's bathroom since 1981.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was a little hard today.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't want to do this anymore.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, Mr. Amikoshi and Mrs. Komori.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You'll be lucky.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Saito, you're in trouble now.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're not good at this.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you for watching.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you for watching.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is the first episode of the hide-and-seek show.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is Mr. Shiro Magi.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How many types can you do?

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can do about seven types.

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You can eat with that.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll never go to the same place again.

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's call the teacher who will do the magic.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is Mr. Sumie.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Nice to meet you, too.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Please shake this.

185
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Three.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Put the three cards in front of you.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Clean up the rest of the cards.

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The back is red.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is red, this is red, and this is red.

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's all red.

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is all blue.

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Even if I shake it like this, the three cards will come out.

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you shake it 10 times, it will come out 10 times.

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The five came out.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What do you mean?

196
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's Trump after all.

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's what you just said.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Who is the real one?

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
First of all, let me introduce the answer.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is Mr. Fuyuki Motoh.

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't usually do anything, do you?

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I usually have a lot of mesh.

203
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Next to me is Mr. Kongo Trunk.

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you shaking it?

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm shaking it.

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mr. Kongo has a lot of mesh.

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I've been shaking it for about three hours.

208
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I prepared this for you today.

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Mr. Kongo.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's a great head.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's like a bad boy.

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The first one is the second one.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The third one is the fourth one.

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The fourth one is too much like Katsura.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This is a lie.

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I see.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm the fourth one.

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There's a big hole.

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's like the most Katsura-like Katsura.

220
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It can't be helped.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It can't be helped.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The second one.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's see the correct answer.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Please.

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The first one.

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No.

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It doesn't fly.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,980
It's a

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's broken.

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's broken.

231
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's not a sound of rain.

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm a little excited.

233
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's broken.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The fourth one.

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's the third one.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's a rehearsal.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is the school.

238
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I set up the place before coming back.

239
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But you're not going back.

240
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm okay.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm not going back.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm okay.

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's where I'm doing now.

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Who did this when I was making the first one?

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Welcome!

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Welcome!

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

253
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, it's the same as the one before.

256
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Dance, dance, dance!

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Good evening.

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Good evening.

259
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We started with dance, dance, dance.

260
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Let me introduce the judges.

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
First, Sugii.

262
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He is the ace.

263
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Wonderful.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What is wonderful?

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Next, Chieko Kishi.

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank you very much.

267
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The way you waved your hand,

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you stopped in the middle.

269
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, yes.

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think it would be better if I didn't stop.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
With that, the waist should be like this.

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Like this.

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Like this.

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like this.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You!

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's finally the last performance.

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The last performance,

278
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
as you all know,

279
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'd like to start right away.

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, he looks quite nervous.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's his 40th performance,

282
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
so it's the last performance.

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No, no, I'm nervous.

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is ridiculous.

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Let's go.

286
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No. 40, pass line.

287
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
How was it?

288
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
How many points did the judges give?

289
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He is a comic artist.

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What a pity.

291
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The judges, please give him more points.

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Are you doing it alone?

293
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes.

294
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He is doing it alone.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Did you make it alone?

296
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What?

298
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Who made it?

299
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

300
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Did you make it alone?

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He made it alone.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The judges, please give him more points.

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He made it.

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Don't fall down.

306
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Congratulations.

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm glad.

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He made it.

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He made it.

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He made it.

311
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He made it.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He made it.

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He made it.

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He is not going to make up like this.

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm glad.

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want to make it and

317
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I want to make it with you.

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to give you a hand.

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I have a wonderful friend like this.

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He made it.

321
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He made it.

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Stop it.

323
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm getting embarrassed.

324
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank you.

325
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you.

326
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He made it.

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He made it.

328
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you.

329
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Here we go.

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Please give him more points.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Please give him more points.

332
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Thank you very much.

333
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's a nice car.

334
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you very much.

335
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a nice car.

336
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Thank you very much.

337
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going home.

338
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm going home.

339
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm going home.

340
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you very much.

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Thank you very much.

342
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Did you get it?

343
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes.

344
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We did a good job.

345
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
How was it?

346
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I couldn't introduce all the guests.

347
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I changed the content of the video.

348
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I sent it like this.

349
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Next week, Hamada will be fine and go home.

350
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I want to show you how to use it.

351
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you very much.

352
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
OK.

353
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm glad.

354
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hey.

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Don't make a mistake.

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not disappointed.

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I thought Yamazaki would drop me.

359
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm not disappointed.

360
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I expected too much from Yamazaki.

361
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's all for today.

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Thank you very much.

363
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Thank you very much.
