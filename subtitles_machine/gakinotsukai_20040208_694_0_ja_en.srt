1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the first episode, we'll show you how to get rid of badminton with the help of kids!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's so cold!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Badminton is something you can do at this time of the year.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It warms you up.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm Kikuchi Otajima.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Mr. Downtown and Mr. Kokoriko are going to have a badminton match.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can be Kokoriko.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You don't have to count.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll be like Doki.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, no, no.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll show you how to do it.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you say that, it'll get worse.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It'll get worse.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It'll get worse.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mr. Otajima, if you get 15 points, you win.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's get started.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's enough for today, right?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's enough.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What do you mean?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What do you mean?

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're standing normally.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's okay.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Do you want to touch each other?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please touch me.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's start with Kokoriko.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's talk about something funny.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're so funny.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A good story from Mr. Kawada.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors of the five groups.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, let's start the Badminton Tournament.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Good.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
100,000 yen.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's go.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Good.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Good.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Good.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Good.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Good.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's winning.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He's still winning.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Good.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wait a minute.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is the sound okay?

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's okay.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You can do it.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Good.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's hot.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's hot.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Good.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a tie.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a tie.

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's cold.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a tie.

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is the sound okay?

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's cold.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's cold.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's cold.

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's cold.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's cold.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why are you still singing at this time?

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because I have a smile on my face.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because I have a smile on my face.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, this is Itao.

74
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Because I have a smile on my face.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's Itao.

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Itao.

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's Itao.

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Itao.

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you doing?

80
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good morning.

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Itao suddenly appeared at the recording site of the game.

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What is his purpose?

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong?

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm having a hard time right now.

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's cold at this time of the year.

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you sleeping?

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There are many people who exercise.

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There are many people today.

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry, but the camera is facing this way.

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The camera is in the back.

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The camera is in the back.

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is the only place I can go around.

94
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why?

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is the only place I can go around.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Really?

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think Itao will understand.

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When I exercise, I have a smile on my face.

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I understand that.

100
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But my life is on the line.

101
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If I don't sell it, I'll be in trouble.

102
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How many did you sell?

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I only have about 10 left.

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is it limited to 10?

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, it's limited.

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't make it.

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tsugawa-san, did you make it?

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't help it.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you want to eat it?

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll give you the rest.

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Really?

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll give it to you.

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

116
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you very much.

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
10 packs?

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
10 packs.

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How much is it?

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's 1,000 yen per pack.

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's expensive.

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Isn't it expensive?

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But the time is the time.

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's why it's strange.

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's why I can't sell it.

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If it's 10 packs, is it 10,000 yen per pack?

127
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's 10,000 yen per pack.

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's 10,000 yen per pack.

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a little expensive.

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a little expensive.

131
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you very much.

132
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's sold out.

133
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is 10,000 yen.

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I understand. Thank you very much.

135
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, no.

137
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry I sold it.

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Good luck.

139
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you very much.

140
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's 1,000 yen.

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you very much.

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you very much.

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you very much.

144
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's sold out.

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What are you going to do if you sell it?

146
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want to sell it at a very high speed.

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't want to sell it.

148
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's fast.

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's fast.

150
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's dangerous in the park.

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please be careful.

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's go.

153
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's go.

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's go.

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go.

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go.

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing?

158
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What are you doing?

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Good job.

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That was good.

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a wind.

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Good job.

163
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Good job.

164
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Wait a minute.

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Bowling.

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Round.

168
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How about a bowling ball?

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Bowling.

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why didn't you stop there?

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Bowling.

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was there.

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I told you not to stop here.

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I stopped here anyway.

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to wait.

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What are you selling?

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Bowling.

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not selling.

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Who are you to say it's not selling?

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's a good thing.

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not selling.

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Did it sell?

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's no hole.

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's no hole?

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's no hole.

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can raise it however you want.

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's like this.

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How many kilograms is this?

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's impossible.

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's slippery.

192
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's impossible for an amateur.

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not like that.

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's impossible for an amateur.

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's good to raise it little by little.

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How much is this?

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's 5,000 yen.

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's expensive.

199
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But it's a little expensive.

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's right.

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But this is also a business.

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't make a living if I'm just a comedian.

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think it's a bad product to go with this.

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But you have to open the hole for yourself.

205
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You don't know how it feels when you get a strike for the first time.

206
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Try it once.

207
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You'll get addicted to it.

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can raise it as many times as you want.

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How many times do I have to raise it?

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can raise it as many times as you want.

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can't stop it.

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What should I do with the board?

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Should I put it here?

214
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No matter how many times you raise it.

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How many are left?

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You have to sell two or three.

218
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There's still a lot left.

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Six?

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know.

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's 33,000 yen.

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know if it's expensive.

223
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't think of anything.

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If it was Yamazaki, it would be a great picture.

225
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's light.

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is it a plus driver?

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It says so.

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't think it's going to open.

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't think it's going to open.

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't think it's a good picture.

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How is it?

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not over yet.

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's almost over.

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Mr. Ito, I'd like to buy this.

236
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Really?

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes, six.

238
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Six?

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's 5,000 yen, right?

240
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's it for today.

242
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right.

243
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's gone.

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

245
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you very much.

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you very much.

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you very much.

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Thank you very much.

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right.

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Please make an opening.

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you very much.

252
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you very much.

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you very much.

254
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you very much.

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you very much.

256
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's 60,000 yen.

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
60,000 yen.

258
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you buy it, it's 30,000 yen.

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

260
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's too early to go home.

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you very much.

262
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not a rally.

263
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a rally.

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come on.

265
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OK.

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's amazing.

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's super good.

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a Super Good.

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I agree.

270
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really.

271
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's amazing.

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you very much.

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Koshiba?

274
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes.

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is Unfortunately.

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Was it in the picture the heater with firewood?

277
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a problem.

278
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's enough, Dao-san.

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Please.

280
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What is this ranking?

281
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What is this?

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What is this?

283
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What do you think?

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What do you think?

285
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is this?

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a family photo.

287
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's wrong with this photo?

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is a collection of various things.

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you'd like, there's more.

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Take a look.

291
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There's a lot.

292
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Can you sell this?

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What is this?

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What's wrong with not being your own family?

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Who is this?

296
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is Machida-san.

297
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you know him?

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No, I don't know him.

299
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Mino-san is sold out.

300
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's a lot.

301
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What do you think of this?

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is taken by someone else.

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's right.

304
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
By the way, how much is this?

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If it's around here, it's 10,000 yen.

306
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's a price tag, too.

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
15,000 yen.

308
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's a lot.

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
1,000 yen.

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
3,000 yen.

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That one is really blue.

312
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, this one?

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I like that one.

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is a little...

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can't sell this.

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is something I cherish.

317
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Is this Itao's?

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is mine.

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is something I cherish.

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This isn't for sale.

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you, but can you sell this?

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I can sell it when I can, but I can't sell it today.

323
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know what to do.

324
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll have to work a little harder.

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think I'll have to work harder.

326
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Even if you work hard, you can sell it.

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll do my best.

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Even if you work hard, you can't sell it.

329
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If this picture comes out at 5 o'clock, it'll be sold out.

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Can you still sell it at 5 o'clock?

331
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can't be a target.

332
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can sell all of this.

333
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Wait a minute.

334
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's a price tag.

335
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's a price tag of about 5,000 yen.

336
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll give you a service.

337
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This one.

338
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't know anything.

339
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll do it.

340
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Really?

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is 5,000 yen.

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you very much.

343
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Excuse me, this is a little rude.

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Excuse me, I'll take it.

345
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you very much.

346
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Excuse me, thank you very much.

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Good luck.

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Excuse me for disturbing you.

349
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you very much.

350
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Excuse me.

351
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's get our spirits back.

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go.

353
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's cold.

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Go.

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you very much.

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm blowing the whistle.

357
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's the same score again.

358
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
OK.

359
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm counting on you.

360
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Go.

361
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
OK.

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Nice.

363
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This one.

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This one.

365
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You're good.

366
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a rally.

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Good.

368
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Good.

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Good.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Good.

371
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Good.

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How was it?

373
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What do you think of a young man who is 150 cm to 175 cm tall?

374
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't stop there.

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's best to stop here.

376
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What is this?

377
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't know anything.

378
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a young man.

379
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What do you think of a young man?

380
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Young man?

381
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Young man of a comedian?

382
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Young man of a comedian?

383
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Young man of a staff?

384
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Young man of a staff?

385
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Young man of a staff?

386
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What is it?

387
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Young man of a staff?

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you think?

389
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is he young?

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The youngest one.

391
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Young man?

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes.

393
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This one.

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, he is young.

395
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He looks older than me.

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He is young.

397
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Wait a minute.

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Where are you looking?

399
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Where are you looking?

400
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This one is a young man of a camera.

401
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Young man of a comedian?

402
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Staff?

403
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There are people like that.

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Is he writing something?

405
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Maybe.

406
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What is he doing?

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He is a comedian.

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Are you surprised?

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What is funny?

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He is a comedian.

411
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He is funny.

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't know anything.

413
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
His reaction is funny.

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know anything.

415
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
His reaction is funny.

416
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He is funny.

417
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is it funny?

418
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can you do something?

419
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He is a comedian.

420
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can do something.

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you want to try something?

422
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No.

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You guys go to the front.

424
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Thank you.

425
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We are checking the cabbage.

426
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is cabbage.

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Conte.

428
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Watermelon.

429
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Go to the front.

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Go.

431
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He is laughing.

432
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He is slow.

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He is like a cherry blossom.

434
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He is like a cola.

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He is funny.

436
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He is funny.

437
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He is funny.

438
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He is funny.

439
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He is funny.

440
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He is funny.

441
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How much is it?

442
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It is 10,000 yen for a set.

443
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It is 5,000 yen for a bottle.

444
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You are a good guy.

445
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Please.

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He is funny.

447
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He is laughing.

448
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Come on!

449
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's no way I can do it!

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If you can do it, sell it!

451
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Hahaha!

452
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Mr. Tsugawa!

453
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes?

454
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's impossible to have a comedian in our show.

456
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Isn't there anyone like Mr. AD?

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why is it written in such an ugly place?

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know what it says.

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But he can do it, right?

460
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He's a comedian, isn't he?

461
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's a comedian, isn't he?

462
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, but...

463
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is it okay?

464
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's 5,000 yen.

465
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll buy it or rent it.

466
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Hahaha!

467
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think he can do something.

468
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
If you'd like, please watch the story.

469
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's 5,000 yen, right?

470
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

471
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, you're going to rent it, right?

473
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes, I'm going to rent it.

474
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Hey, Itao!

476
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes?

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's really over here.

478
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you doing badminton?

479
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I told you earlier.

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you don't stop, you'll be in trouble.

481
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please.

483
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do your best.

484
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes.

485
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Are you okay?

486
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll do my best.

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's starting today, isn't it?

488
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think I'll get a job right away.

489
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Are you okay?

490
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That woman doesn't laugh at all.

491
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hahaha!

492
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Here we go!

493
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
All right!

494
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Good luck!

495
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All right!

496
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's good.

497
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wow!

498
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay, okay, okay!

499
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's a wind.

500
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a wind.

501
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Nice serve!

502
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
All right!

503
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, one more time.

504
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's good.

505
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's good.

506
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Itao, go ahead.

507
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll continue.

508
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No-ban-yaki-mo!

509
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What?

510
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What?

511
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No-ban-yaki-mo!

512
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's stopped again.

513
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Itao, don't stop there!

514
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Dao-san!

515
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes?

516
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's a no-ban-yaki-mo?

517
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's a no-ban-yaki-mo where you can watch a dance.

518
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No-ban-shabu-shabu?

519
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes.

520
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't like it very much.

521
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, I can't help it because it's work.

522
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Imo is definitely delicious.

523
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes.

524
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes.

525
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What do you think?

526
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just a no-ban-yaki-mo.

527
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
By the way, how much is a no-ban-yaki-mo?

528
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
1,500 yen.

529
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Just one?

530
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, it's a little more expensive than a normal no-ban-yaki-mo.

531
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's expensive, isn't it?

532
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's expensive, isn't it?

533
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But, well, there's also the entertainment part.

534
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Just one?

535
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, if it's just one...

536
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, if it's just one, you can see it.

537
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You can see the entertainment part.

538
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You can see who's going to buy one.

539
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry if it's like this, but I'm sorry if you don't get six of these.

540
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
9,000 yen?

541
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
9,500 yen?

542
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
9,000 yen?

543
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
9,000 yen?

544
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, 10,000 yen is fine for six of us.

545
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's expensive.

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's 9,000 yen for 1,500 yen.

547
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, 10,000 yen is fine for us.

548
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's 10,000 yen for six of us.

549
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Is that so?

550
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you very much.

551
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you very much.

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's 40,000 yen.

553
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Excuse me.

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:41,000
By the way, I'm not wearing underwear.

555
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's cold.

556
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's cold.

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's cold.

558
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's 6,000 yen.

559
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not wearing underwear under the jeepan.

560
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not wearing underwear under the jeepan.

561
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm not wearing underwear under the jeepan.

562
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a no-pass.

563
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's longer than I thought.

564
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There's a variation.

565
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There's a lot.

566
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Thank you very much.

567
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It doesn't matter if it's gold or not.

568
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't see anything.

569
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Where are you going?

570
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Thank you very much.

571
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't stay here.

573
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I know.

574
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm afraid of the habit.

575
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I know.

576
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll be careful.

577
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Thank you very much.

578
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The hand I'm holding is cold.

579
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's cold.

580
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's colder than usual.

581
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I can't eat it.

582
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's colder than it is now.

583
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That music is annoying.

584
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't like that music.

585
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't like it.

586
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
2 points.

587
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
America wins.

588
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The final whistle will be blown.

589
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The last whistle will be blown.

590
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The final whistle was blown.

591
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The final whistle was blown.

592
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What is this?

593
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What do you mean?

594
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's like cash.

595
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There's no waste.

596
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is a waste collection vehicle.

597
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What?

598
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Hidao-san, what?

599
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We're doing a waste collection.

600
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What do you mean by waste collection?

601
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We don't need it anymore.

602
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Do you have a ball?

603
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I have it already.

604
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We're selling it.

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
How much will you give us?

606
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well...

607
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's complicated.

608
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Maybe 500 yen each.

609
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If that's the case,

610
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we'll take family photos and ADs.

611
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We'll take them all.

612
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't want it anymore.

613
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's go.

614
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Are you sure?

615
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

616
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Thank you.

617
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This is a waste collection vehicle.

618
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It won't move.

619
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It won't move.

620
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What?

621
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
With your daughter?

622
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
My daughter and I are acting suspiciously.

623
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He took it.

624
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is the worst.

625
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is the worst.

626
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Look at them.

627
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My daughter is a waste.

628
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The 2004 version of the waste collection vehicle has finally been completed.

629
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
One is an Asian Perfume.

630
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The other is an Asian Perfume.

631
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But my mother is the best.

632
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The end.

633
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:37,000
