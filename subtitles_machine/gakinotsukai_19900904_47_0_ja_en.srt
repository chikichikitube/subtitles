1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the Gaki no Tsukai Arai-hen!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The Gaki no Tsukai Arai-hen has reached 1 million yen!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That's great!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First of all, please explain.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is...

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is...

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the wig I've been wearing for the past 3 years.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You...

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You've been wearing a wig like this for the past 3 years?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've been wearing this for the past 3 years.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've been wearing this for the past 3 years.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the one I've been using often.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Isn't there anyone who has grown fond of this?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Kondo Masao.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Kondo Masao, right?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, it's a certain pattern.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is Hagimoto-san.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's Kin-chan?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is a...

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is a...

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is a...

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a...

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You want to do a parody of that show itself?

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, we'll do the special points.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, there's this?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, there's this.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, I'll wear this.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll wear this and go inside.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll go up like this.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, you're wearing this?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, 15 points or more is a pass?

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, it's a pass.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For example, if I stop at the bottom of 15 points,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll make a sound like this.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, I'll stop at the bottom of 15 points.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, you won't stop?

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll stop.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, I'll make a sound like this.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What is this costume? I don't like it at all.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's slippery, it's slippery.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The audience is making noise.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What is this, what is this?

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If I go up to here, you have to do a cartwheel.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're doing a cartwheel.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm doing a cartwheel.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't like this costume at all.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I hope I can get out of here.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everyone is doing this.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You'll go around in a cartwheel.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
When you come out,

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll wear this wig,

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and put on makeup,

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and put on these clothes,

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and I'll be wearing this mic,

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and my eyes will be drooping,

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and I'll come out like a goldfish.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll be like, I'm so glad.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I'll come out like this.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll say, I want to go higher.

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to go higher.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And then you'll be like...

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Booboo booboo booboo booboo

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Congratulations!

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's perfect.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You see, there's a camera right next to it.

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can use this to go up to the top.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, I see.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Like this?

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes. I can use this to go up to the top.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can use this to go up to the top.

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's right.

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Like this?

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is good.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I'm wearing a suit like this.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I'm like,

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm glad.

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to close my eyes.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can do it.

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I can do it.

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can do it.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm confident I'll get a million yen if I pass the audition.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Really?

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The judges might not even know I'm Nozawa.

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I heard you were like that before.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right?

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In that case, I'll say,

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll say,

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll say,

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll say,

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll say,

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll say,

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll say,

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll say,

99
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I really don't believe that.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes, that's true.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It can't be helped.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It can't be helped.

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not anyone's fault.

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's all Nikko's fault.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's all Nikko's fault.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah!

111
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Really.

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I waited for an hour and a half.

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
When I was on the plane at 3 o'clock, I was already on time.

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It was like, bing, bong, bong, bong.

115
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At the airport.

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The 3 o'clock flight to Tokyo is at 4 o'clock.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're lying.

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's like you're stuttering.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not stuttering.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was hungry.

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was hungry.

123
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In the end, I was late for an hour.

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I waited for another 30 minutes.

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was late for an hour and a half.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When you get on the plane, you'll be late again, right?

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's right.

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When I got on the plane, I got on the plane.

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It was annoying again.

130
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When I finally got on the plane, I was surrounded by kids.

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Front, back, and side. It was annoying.

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was hungry.

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't forgive kids.

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why?

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It was annoying.

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I couldn't help it.

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You were happy.

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You couldn't help it.

140
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was annoying on the side.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But it was annoying on the front, back, left, and right.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I couldn't help it.

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
On the seat?

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was surrounded by kids.

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You were surrounded by kids.

147
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I was surrounded by kids.

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The old man behind me was angry because of the pig.

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was a serious situation.

151
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It was hard for an hour.

152
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It was a serious situation.

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It was a serious situation.

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It was hard for an hour.

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
These days, parents don't care about their kids.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I see.

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When I was a kid, my father was very strict.

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He told me that I would lose if I played with him.

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He told you that you couldn't win.

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
These days, parents don't care about their kids.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They tell me not to say things I don't want to say.

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
My father is laughing.

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I see.

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There was a shelf in front of me.

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There was a juice.

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He said, I'm thirsty. Take it.

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I found it.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I was surprised.

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is that?

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is that?

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That kid was very mean.

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If my father wasn't there, I would have dropped him.

174
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's right.

175
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Really.

176
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I whispered to him.

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I said, ready, set, go.

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's hard to forgive.

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
These days, kids have a lot of money.

180
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kids have a lot of fashion.

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right.

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's hard to forgive.

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My father's watch.

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's hard to forgive.

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The other day, he was like that.

186
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Jiro.

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He was on a TV show.

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He was on a TV show.

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There was a pig boy.

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He was in elementary school.

191
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He lost weight by 18kg.

192
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's right.

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Really?

194
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He put a watch on him.

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He was trying to be a diver.

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was hard.

197
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Time doesn't matter to you.

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, no.

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is this?

200
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Time doesn't matter to you.

202
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really.

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I said this when I was a kid.

204
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kids are young when they grow up.

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How much did it cost us to grow up?

206
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Jiro.

208
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Kids these days are growing up.

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They are young.

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Kids these days are growing up.

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They are amazing.

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They are the president.

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They are like a president.

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The other day, he was really lazy.

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He was like this.

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He put a watch on him.

217
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sometimes, he was like this.

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He was like a brother and a sister.

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
His little sister was so lazy.

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So he put it on here instead of here.

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's annoying.

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's annoying to put it on here.

223
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I look at adults.

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I look at adults.

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I look at adults.

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Like this.

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't think about that.

228
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was on a plane.

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I had a question.

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's been a while since you've been on a plane.

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There's a reclining.

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You have to lower it.

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
When you land, you have to raise it.

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why do you do that?

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's dangerous.

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why is it dangerous?

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's like this.

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's dangerous about it?

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What?

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What if you get shocked?

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If I get shocked,

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know if it's better or worse.

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why do you do that?

245
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's dangerous if you're about to be blown away.

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's dangerous if you're about to be blown away.

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why do you smoke when you land?

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You don't know that either, do you?

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why do you do that?

250
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Either way,

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when you fall, you get a little dizzy.

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It doesn't matter if you smoke.

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
When you get dizzy, you fall.

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You get a little dizzy.

255
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's like this.

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
When you smoke, you fall.

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You hit the old man in the back.

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The old man is on the back.

259
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you doing?

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's long.

261
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You get a little dizzy.

262
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You get a little dizzy.

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's how it goes.

264
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why do you like Katsura?

265
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Everyone in the world says that.

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can't help it.

267
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not saying anything.

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But there are a lot of strange things.

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why?

270
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Two people riding a bicycle.

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's been stopped a lot, hasn't it?

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why not?

273
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Someone answer me.

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You don't know, do you?

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, if you say that,

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
it's because it's dangerous.

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's easy to clean up.

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If that's the case,

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
it's more dangerous to ride two people in a single car.

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You can wear a helmet over there.

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Two people riding a bicycle with a helmet on.

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But you're going to a country school.

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're wearing a helmet.

284
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can't ride two people in a single car.

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's what I'm saying.

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's why.

287
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's why.

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can wear a helmet and ride a bicycle.

289
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You can't ride two people in a single car with a helmet on.

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

291
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Damn it!

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then why do you ride a bicycle?

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why can't you ride two people on a bicycle?

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's what I'm saying.

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's why.

296
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why can't you ride two people on a bicycle?

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can't ride a bicycle.

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What?

299
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You can't ride two people in a single car.

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But you can't ride a bicycle.

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No matter how many times you wear a helmet.

302
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know.

304
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
By the way, you looked like a yakuza today.

305
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why are you saying such a bad thing?

306
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm a yakuza.

307
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I got on the plane.

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm still moving.

309
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I landed on the plane.

310
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What?

311
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm going to run for a while.

312
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I have to fly.

313
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm still moving.

314
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please wait for me at the seat belt.

315
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm still moving.

316
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Please wait for me at the seat belt.

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going to run for a while.

318
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Excuse me.

319
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The plane is still moving.

320
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm still moving.

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Please wait for me at the seat belt.

322
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You looked like this.

323
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What is this?

324
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What is this?

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No.

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I was stopped.

327
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was told to go.

328
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I couldn't get out of the plane.

329
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The seat belt was in the back.

330
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So I went to the seat belt.

331
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Then I got on the plane.

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I couldn't make it to work.

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's not what I said.

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

335
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I couldn't make it to work.

336
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's because I was late.

337
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's go to Haragi.

338
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Please.

339
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hello.

340
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hello.

341
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What about today?

342
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What is that?

343
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't have money.

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Really?

345
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You applied yourself, didn't you?

346
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You didn't apply yourself.

347
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't have money.

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How much do you have?

349
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
22.

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You smile a lot.

351
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why?

352
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know.

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you have a bad head?

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't say that.

355
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is against the rules.

356
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Really?

357
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

358
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I only have this.

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, you can't wear this.

360
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sure of it.

361
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If you wear this, you can't wear anything.

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you don't wear this, you can't wear anything.

363
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This is strange.

364
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can't wear this.

365
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can't wear this.

366
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't wear this.

367
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can't wear this.

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is not a problem.

369
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is...

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Where are you pointing?

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
In the end, everyone will see this.

372
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you don't wear this, the shape will be the same.

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No, I like the black color here.

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You can see it from here.

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I can't see it.

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What are you talking about?

377
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Thank you very much.

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you very much.

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's introduce the postcards.

380
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Good evening.

381
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I heard that there is a new film crew called Black Keys in Osaka.

382
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is that true?

383
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I haven't seen it yet.

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They have a bad attitude.

386
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There are four of them.

387
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
They are all wearing black clothes.

388
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm ugly.

389
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I like that kind of person.

390
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I used to be like that.

391
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When I was a fairy, I liked an ugly woman.

392
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What?

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I liked an ugly woman.

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I didn't like her, but I liked her.

395
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Matsumoto-kun, Matsumoto-kun.

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They always follow me.

397
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
At that time, there were only about 10 fans.

398
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The fans gathered.

399
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Matsumoto-kun said, but the ugly woman was a little far away.

400
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hitoshi.

401
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hitoshi.

402
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's really your style.

403
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's go home.

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Where are you going?

405
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What do you want to do?

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There is a woman who uses such a cowardly hand.

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I have a request today.

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I want you to give my grandfather a nickname.

409
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
My grandfather is 76 years old.

410
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He is completely stupid.

411
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
As soon as he was stupid, he got better.

412
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He took a dog and ran around the neighborhood.

413
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And on the way, when there was a pole, he bit the pole and said,

414
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm going to sell it.

415
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Children in the neighborhood are called stupid in Iwasaki.

416
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's not funny, so please give me a good nickname.

417
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
By the way, stupid is not a joke, but a real stupid.

418
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What kind of nickname do you have?

419
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't follow such an old man.

420
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Grandmother.

421
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm old, so I can't understand it.

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm very tall.

423
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm 186 cm tall.

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's why I stand out more in school and on the train.

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm a high school girl, so I'm fine in school.

426
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But I'm seen a lot on the train.

427
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's embarrassing.

428
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I hate it very much, but I can't do anything about it.

429
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
My grandmother in the neighborhood says,

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm a girl and I can't marry you because I'm so tall.

431
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
How can I not stand out?

432
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm 106 cm tall.

433
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm the most famous person in the family.

434
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I can't think of another nickname.

435
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If I say that, I'll be cut off.

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm the director's favorite.

437
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What do you think?

438
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm short.

439
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But a girl like me is fine with a boy who is shorter than me.

440
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't care if a man cares.

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

442
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There's no problem with girls.

443
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But a girl who is taller than me is fine.

444
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That kind of sex.

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is that so?

446
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is a man's desire, isn't it?

447
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's better than me.

448
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why are you always like that?

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm glad you said yes.

450
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But you're so simple.

451
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What are you talking about?

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I've never dated a girl taller than me.

453
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't know.

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Even if you say that, it's not good.

455
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Men want to have sex with a girl taller than them.

456
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They also want to have sex with a girl they don't like.

457
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you go down?

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Down and up.

459
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's like we're going back in time.

460
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You...

461
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If it's up, what are you?

462
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What's up?

463
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What's up?

464
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Meiji?

465
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's Taisho.

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's Taisho.

467
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's Taisho.

468
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You're a fucking old woman.

469
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But you have feelings.

470
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can say Heisei.

471
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No.

472
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No.

473
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You can think of Heisei.

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But Taisho...

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No, it's Taisho.

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Taisho is a little...

477
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's right.

478
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If it's Heisei, it's enough.

479
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What's wrong with Heisei?

480
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If it's Heisei, how old are you?

481
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
One year old.

482
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
One year old.

483
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You'll be okay in a dozen years.

484
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Can you eat it?

485
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's yakiniku.

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's yakiniku.

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You'll be okay.

488
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes, I can eat it.

489
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You'll be okay.

490
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Can you eat it?

491
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, I can eat it.

492
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Next...

493
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Which one should I choose?

494
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I have one, too.

495
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
When I went to Shinjuku the other day, I bought a down-down T-shirt for 500 yen.

496
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
500 yen?

497
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But when I went home, it said down-down.

498
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And below that, it said Hamada Hitoshi Matsumoto Masatoshi.

499
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Have you ever bought a down-down T-shirt like this?

500
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you have, please tell me.

501
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll be tricked. I have one.

502
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
A cassette.

503
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You have it with me.

504
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's Kenji Sada, right?

505
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Kenji Sada.

506
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Kenji Sada, the best singer.

507
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You two go buy it.

508
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There are about 20 songs in the cassette.

509
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you look at it, it says,

510
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you look at it, it says,

511
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Darling, Tokio.

512
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's go to your house and listen to it together.

513
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's 1000 yen.

514
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
All the hit songs are in it.

515
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It says, Kenji Sada, the best singer.

516
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's cheap.

517
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I went to my house.

518
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
When I opened the cassette,

519
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It said, I'm talking to you.

520
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm talking to you.

521
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't understand.

522
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He's an old man.

523
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He's talking to an old man.

524
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you look at it, it says,

525
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Suzuki Ichiro.

526
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Who are you?

527
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's true.

528
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That was the worst.

529
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It was the worst.

530
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I won.

531
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
There's a trick.

532
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's go to the last one.

533
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tokiotto.

534
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Katsura-chan.

535
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I've been going to the downtown every Monday since the summer vacation.

536
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's where I felt it.

537
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
When the fans of Hama-chan shout Hama-chan,

538
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
They shake their hands and say hello.

539
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Mach-chan is a scoundrel.

540
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you hate the fans of Mach-chan?

541
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
By the way, Nitta-san is also a scoundrel.

542
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He's the manager.

543
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There's a fool who's a scoundrel.

544
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What's that like?

545
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He's a scoundrel.

546
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Mach-chan?

547
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm not really Mach-chan.

548
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I see.

549
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then who are you?

550
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My real name is Ota Souichi.

551
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What?

552
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm not really Mach-chan.

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm not really Mach-chan.

554
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Ota.

555
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm not really Mach-chan.

556
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm not really Mach-chan.

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ota, let's go to the next one.

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's go to that one.

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What do people call you?

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What?

561
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What do people call you?

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They call me Okkun.

563
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I see.

564
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll ask the people who are watching TV now.

565
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll ask the people who are watching TV now.

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Okkun?

567
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's right.

568
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's more like it.

569
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's more like it.

570
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The opening is like this.

571
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The opening is like this.

572
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We're going to do it like this.

573
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I want you to see it.

574
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If you suddenly see it, everyone will be shocked.

575
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a very high probability that we'll win.

576
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's a strong impact.

577
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
In a sense, it's a super zone.

578
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What are you talking about?

579
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You don't know either.

580
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What?

581
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You don't know either.

582
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's true.

583
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's win for now.

584
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think it's better to think about how to use 1 million yen.

585
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Do you use it on TV?

586
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I used it on TV.

587
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I used it on TV.

588
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And the assistant.

589
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's really a little less now, isn't it?

590
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's right.

591
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't think it's possible.

592
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Really?

593
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think it's better to continue until now.

594
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I haven't been recruiting recently.

595
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I see.

596
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm looking for more assistants.

597
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm looking for more assistants.

598
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Please send it to me.

599
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

600
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't have a lot of money now.

601
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I think I can get a lot of money if I send it.

602
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think I can get a lot of money if I send it.

603
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm looking for more assistants.

604
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm looking for more assistants.

605
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Please send it to me.

606
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm looking for more assistants.

607
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm looking for more assistants.

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Bye bye!
