1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We are...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The water bugs of the entertainment world!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This year, the 11th Gaki no Tsukai Kourei Entertainment's Fishing Contest

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the slightly cold autumn of Kawamuchiko, the entertainment world's fishing idiots have gathered this year as well

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But the ones who have been able to climb the Black Bucks so far are Okuda, Matsumoto, Tamada, Aikawa and the only 4 of them in the 9.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The ones who have been able to come to this mountain are...

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's sad.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In the first round of the first round, the fishing competition for the best of the best, the second half of the competition starts.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The rules of the fishing competition are simple. The person who catches the biggest fish in the time will be the winner.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But, it's been an hour since the opening. This year is even more boring than the previous year.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Meanwhile...

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, the people who are going to give us the tickets have brought them here.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, shall we get ready right away?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes!

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then, please give us the tickets!

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They are the people.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's really cool.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That person is this person.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's Ishihara-kun.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, you're here!

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And this time, we'd like to invite everyone from the Itaida group to come to the stage.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you guys doing?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you guys doing?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's been a while.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What are you doing?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's going on, boss?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's not good.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Recently, you haven't gotten rid of your mischievousness, have you?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You should retire soon.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please take a picture of the o-hagi.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please take a picture of the o-hagi.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is pretty good.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's like a hamburger.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, hey, hey.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll take one.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Eat it.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll take one.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
O-hagi.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sorry.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, Tami-Tami.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, long time no see.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't see anything.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mr. Ishihara and Mr. Ishihara.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is a dream-like photo.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Excuse me.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The mirror over there is completely invisible.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, it's the same thing.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,580
Please take a picture of the

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,000
I can see it completely.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr. Daimon, why are you so angry?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Every time.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Daimon is angry.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm gonna get angry.

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
You should get more angry.

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,420
Don't get angry.

61
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,500
Shall we go?

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
We're going to the next one.

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I'm going to the next one.

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Can I come in a moment?

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay.

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Please come in.

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
It's nice to meet you.

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
It's been a while, hasn't it?

70
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Yeah, it's been a while.

71
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
How have you been?

72
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I've been good.

73
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh, I see.

74
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Thank you.

75
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Thank you for waiting, Machan.

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Well, I'm sorry.

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
What?

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I think you're a bit of a fanatic about cheating.

79
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I was going to start a fire, but...

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Asano-san, you're quite...

81
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Recently, you've been acting like you have a taste.

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Asano-san, you're a bit of a fanatic about cheating.

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Hey, you...

84
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Let's go.

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
What are you angry about?

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
What are you doing?

87
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Why are you so angry?

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
What is it?

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Daimon-san, please smile.

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
It's scary, isn't it?

91
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Eh?

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Well, well.

93
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Mr. Yamamoto, you are Yujiro Ishihara. How long have you been doing this? Is this your first time?

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
No, this is my first time.

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
How is it?

96
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I'm always so young, I'm a bit surprised.

97
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Always so young, right?

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Please leave it to me.

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
How is it? Is it fun?

100
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Are you having fun?

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Yes, I'm having fun.

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Shall I sing?

103
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
No.

104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
It's okay.

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
It's okay?

106
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
It's okay.

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
It's okay.

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
It's okay.

109
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
It's okay.

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
It's okay.

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I have my own taste.

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Hey!

113
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
It's Kotaro.

114
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
What?

115
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Haruhiko!

116
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Are you fishing?

117
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Are you fishing?

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
It's a big fish.

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
It's a big fish.

120
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
What are you doing?

121
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Tachi and...

122
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Kotaro?

123
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
That's right.

124
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Why are you fighting?

125
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
The captain is complaining.

126
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Hey, watch out!

127
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
It's delicious!

128
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
It's delicious!

129
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
The chicken is delicious!

130
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Ichido regains his composure and goes to the second half.

131
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Then, finally this person...

132
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Please take me.

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Go further.

134
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
How about this?

135
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
It's strange!

136
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Itoi's miscommunication.

137
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Today, it seems that he is hated by the fish

138
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
At that time, Okuda's boat was lost

139
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Did he get a big one?

140
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Did it fly away?

141
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
No, no, it's a Mew

142
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Unfortunately, Blue Gill

143
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Other than Black Bass, the rules over there

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Hmm, it's close

145
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
On the other hand, even with this boat

146
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh! Oh! Oh!

147
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
It's dead! It's dead!

148
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Ah! Ah!

149
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Ah! Ah!

150
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
What are you doing?

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
But even so, I'm still envious.

152
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Hey, you were watching!

153
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I want it! I want something like that!

154
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
What's wrong?

155
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh, the eyeliner was huge!

156
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Somehow, I'm getting embarrassed like this.

157
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Once again, he has to struggle.

158
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Then, he changes his mood and starts this project.

159
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Everyone, I would like to introduce you to the new project.

160
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Downtown Tour!

161
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
30 minutes of time limit.

162
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
The first person to catch the bus on this downtown tour will receive a prize.

163
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
And the amount is...

164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Last time, nobody said anything.

165
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,500
This year, the carryover is 200,000 yen!

166
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
It's 200,000 yen with a special discount.

167
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,500
And the person who will make this down-down ruler is this person!

168
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Eh, is it another woman?

169
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,500
White and black, ecstasy, Hepolarm!

170
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Aikawa-san, black and white, let's go!

171
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
This is the cover of the book, Hepolarm.

172
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I think it's hard to understand.

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Hepolarm!

174
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
You'll be surprised when you see it.

175
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
This is the cover of the book, Hepolarm.

176
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Don't take it off.

177
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You can't take it off.

178
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Kamata-san and Matsumoto-san.

179
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Show me.

180
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Which one?

181
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
What should I do?

182
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll just go with my own way.

183
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I'll go with the blue one.

184
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
The blue one is for Matsumoto-san.

185
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Be careful!

186
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
What are you doing?

187
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Hey!

188
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
What are you doing?

189
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
What are you doing?

190
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
What are you doing?

191
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
What the hell is this?

192
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Hurry up!

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Be careful!

194
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Don't open it!

195
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Hurry up!

196
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
What the hell is this?

197
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm going to tear it up!

198
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Hurry up!

199
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Hurry up!

200
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Hurry up!

201
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Hurry up!

202
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Hurry up!

203
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Hurry up!

204
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
I'm so tired.

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Hamada's floor is orange and Matsumoto's floor is blue.

206
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Can you choose this one?

207
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Yes.

208
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,500
After you do this, you have to do this.

209
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
What are you doing?

210
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
What are you doing?

211
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
He's swimming! He's swimming!

212
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
He's swimming!

213
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
The hippo is swimming!

214
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I don't like this guy!

215
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Hippo!

216
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
The waves are strong!

217
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Scary!

218
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Let's go back to the starting point.

219
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Sorry for the wait.

220
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Hippo!

221
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Hippo, look!

222
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Where is he?

223
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
There!

224
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
There!

225
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
He is heavy!

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
He is heavy!

227
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
You are so cute!

228
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
You are heavy!

229
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Rua!

230
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Help me!

231
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Rua!

232
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Rua!

233
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Your head is too heavy!

234
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
My head is too heavy!

235
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
What?

236
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
It's heavy!

237
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
It's not that heavy, is it?

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
It's heavy.

239
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Thank you for your hard work.

240
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Thank you.

241
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Young people all over the country, please study hard.

242
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,500
The first prize is 200,000 yen.

243
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Ready, start!

244
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:37,500
All the members are throwing their lures at the same time. Everyone is aiming for 200,000 yen.

245
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I haven't caught anything so far.

246
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I feel like I'm going to catch something there.

247
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,500
And Yamasaki's boat, which was rivaled by Hamada, finally comes to the serious mode.

248
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Oh, no!

249
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Oh, no!

250
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
No, it's a big loss.

251
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Yamasaki and Kato's intentions are intertwined, and the atmosphere is very bad.

252
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Meanwhile, the boys, except Matsumoto, are still...

253
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
What's wrong?

254
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
What?

255
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
This is...

256
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Unfortunately, their voices are weak.

257
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,500
15 minutes have passed since the start of the lure time.

258
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Who will be able to overcome this time?

259
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Basically fishing is in Japan.

260
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
The owner.

261
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
The owner.

262
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Yes, yes.

263
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I think he will spend the second round in a state where no one is fishing.

264
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I think that's absolutely no good.

265
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Please think about that.

266
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
If you think so, then you guys should have let someone else dive.

267
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,500
You should have let someone else dive because you like the hippo ramen.

268
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
And then, today's best friend Itoi.

269
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
I don't have luck or luck anymore.

270
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
He's completely out of it.

271
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I don't want to see a Itoi like that.

272
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I've never heard such a line before.

273
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
And the time limit is 3 minutes left.

274
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
What? What's wrong?

275
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
What's wrong, Pong-san?

276
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You're still with Kotaro-kun?

277
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
You're so stupid.

278
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Which is wrong?

279
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
It's Kotaro-kun.

280
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
It's definitely Kotaro-kun. You can tell by his face.

281
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
If you look at his face, it's Zaki-san.

282
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
It's 100% Zaki-san.

283
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I think Kotaro is very irritated.

284
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What is this?

285
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
And then...

286
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
What is this?

287
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
What is this?

288
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
What is this?

289
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
It's huge.

290
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Did you see it?

291
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
It's huge.

292
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
It's heavy!

293
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
It's heavy?

294
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
It's heavy.

295
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
What is this?

296
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What is this?

297
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
What is this?

298
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
What is this?

299
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
What?

300
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Pet bottle?

301
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
The end!

302
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
The lure time prize will be brought back next year.

303
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
And the fishing competition is over.

304
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:48,500
The men who have finished the battle, are surrounded by delicious food and praise each other's skills.

305
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,500
But, the fate of victory is still worrying.

306
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Who will get the award this year?

307
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
The result announcement!

308
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Please look at my partner.

309
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Please look at his face. It's crazy.

310
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
That's right.

311
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Isn't it enough?

312
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
He's like a sour man.

313
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
First, Koizumi Koudaro.

314
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
He's here.

315
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You won't see him anymore.

316
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
The next one is...

317
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,500
This one!

318
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm so frustrated.

319
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I want him to be on the show again.

320
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Sato Haruko-kun, if I didn't have this, I might have graduated.

321
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Don! High-Five!

322
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
The ship was bad.

323
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,500
What's wrong with that? I want you to work hard with this young power.

324
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Now, Hosei-san, it's the same ship.

325
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Let's go! Hosei-san, here you are!

326
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Don! High-Five!

327
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I think that the power of their anger is amazing.

328
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Senpai, you are so annoying.

329
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Next is Asano.

330
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Don Bonne!

331
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
You were depressed all the time.

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm sorry for the words I said.

334
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm sorry for you.

335
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
When I was eating, I ate a lot of sweets.

336
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
What kind of combination is that?

337
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Please come again next year.

338
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Next, Shigesato.

339
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Thank you for your time.

340
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Ahhhh!

341
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,700
He did!

342
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Here goes a fish!

343
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,000
This is a type of catfish called the mackerel welass.

344
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,640
This was a character And we need to let it go!

345
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,100
The screen cried again!

346
00:16:05,360 --> 00:15:57,140
We couldn't

347
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,560
One day we landed

348
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,640
And caught the fish

349
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,700
She's fcéfé to get.

350
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,260
The next is Hamada-san

351
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,820
Here's the beefing champion.

352
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Thank you!

353
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:34,860
applause

354
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,780
17.5

355
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,780
Well, it seems that you know it.

356
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
Yes, I do.

357
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Let's see the third one.

358
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
Aikawa Sho-san.

359
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Aikawa-san.

360
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Sho-san looks like a cake.

361
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,780
But, he is so careful when he catches fish.

362
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,780
He is so careful when he catches fish.

363
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,780
Let's see.

364
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Aikawa Sho-san, here it is.

365
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Look, it's big.

366
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
That's Bluegill.

367
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
That's the biggest one.

368
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,780
It's a pity that the fish is so big.

369
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
How many centimeters is the small fish?

370
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,780
It's over 17.5 centimeters.

371
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,780
It's coming.

372
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
It's 20 centimeters.

373
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
The small fish is 20 centimeters.

374
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
It's the top fish now.

375
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
It's Matsumoto.

376
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
It's a big fish.

377
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Let's go.

378
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
It's huge!

379
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,780
It's huge!

380
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,780
It's huge!

381
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
It's huge!

382
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Isn't this the bus 3?

383
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,780
The bus 3 is the best!

384
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Isn't this my bus?

385
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,780
Isn't this a small house?

386
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
This is huge!

387
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
But it's only one person.

388
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
26cm

389
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
26cm

390
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,780
26cm

391
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,780
26cm

392
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,780
Amazing

393
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,780
It's smaller than the normal one

394
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
It's smaller than the normal one

395
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
There are many in the box

396
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,780
There are many in the box

397
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
Okuda Tamiyo

398
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,780
Here it is

399
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
There are 8cm

400
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
There are 8cm

401
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
I wanted your size

402
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
How about Kamiyo-san's 26cm?

403
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,780
What are you looking at?

404
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Let's go!

405
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,780
23cm!

406
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,780
The winner is Matsumoto!

407
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
The winner is Matsumoto Hitoshi-dono.

408
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
You are the 11th champion.

409
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
You are a professional fisherman.

410
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,780
You never stop fishing.

411
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
He won the championship with his own style.

412
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,780
I will award him with this achievement.

413
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,780
On October 26, 2017, the producer of Nihon Television, KENJI SUGA.

414
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
Congratulations!

415
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Thank you!

416
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
Thank you!

417
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Thank you!

418
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
Thank you!

419
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,780
Congratulations!

420
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
He's back!

421
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
He's back!

422
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
He's back!

423
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,780
This year's 3-win tournament closed with Matsumoto's 4th win.

424
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Here's a present announcement.

425
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,780
5 special downtown lures used in the program

426
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,780
The winner, Matsumoto Hitoshi's crab-eating house will be given to one person

427
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,780
Please apply for the prize on the day of the prize

428
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
The deadline is December 12

429
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,780
Well, today I tried to do a performance called Donzoko

430
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
I have to make crabs.

431
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
I can't see any hope from now on.

432
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,780
I think it went well as a play.

433
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,780
There are many people who write 2 in the house.

434
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,780
I caught a lot, but I don't think it's reflected in the picture.

435
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,780
I'm happy every day with this tone.

436
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Well, there's a rod, and there's a string attached to it, and there's a hook attached to it.

437
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Well, the fish come up, and if you do that, the fish will come up on their own.

438
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,780
I don't think I'm great at all.

439
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,780
They can't do that, and they're...

440
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,780
Are they stupid?

441
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Idiot!

442
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Are you surprised?

443
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,780
It seems that I don't get along with Haruhiko-kun

444
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,780
Next year, it seems that Haruhiko-kun will graduate

445
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Please let me and the younger ones do it

446
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
With the young weapons

447
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Winx, Rage, Yamagami brothers

448
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,780
I want to do it

449
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
I'm waiting!

450
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,780
It was only the Yamagami brothers.

451
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:31,780
I don't know what to say, but I wanted to catch something.

452
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,780
I want to win against Matsumoto.

453
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,780
I'm sorry for that. I was too emotional.

454
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I don't really say it like that.

455
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,780
On New Year's, I want to go to Tokyo with my family.

456
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,780
Please.

457
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,780
I've never thought about getting on other people's ship.

458
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Other people's ships looked really cool.

459
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,780
I'm very frustrated but it was very fun.

460
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,780
I want to go out again and catch one more fish.

461
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,780
Next year, I won't be on the same boat as Shota Aikawa.

462
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
I have to be careful.

463
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,780
It's okay, Shota-san. It's okay.

464
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
What's wrong?

465
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
This is not true.

466
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Look, you're really drunk.

467
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780
This is not true.

468
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,780
Next year, you will be on the show, right?

469
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,780
Will you let me be on the show?

470
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
I will.

471
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Next year, I will be on the show.

472
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Excuse me.

473
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,780
I will do my best.

474
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,780
Then, I will introduce the last one, Haruhiko Kato.

475
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
I thought you would jump.

476
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,780
It's impossible.

477
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
I will do my best.

478
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Next year, too.

479
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,780
So you're going to give him something again, right?

480
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Yes, yes, yes, something like a murder.

481
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,780
It's a murder, so it's just a murder.

482
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
But thank you very much.

483
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,780
Please do your best next time.

484
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,780
And Uesugi's movie.

485
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,620
This stick happily

486
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,460
I always put it in my bag

487
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,420
Actually

488
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,260
l got a friend who was always good at Highcla

489
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,260
I can't say that TOO

490
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,340
except

491
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,620
The guy I met last year

492
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,380
That guy

493
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,800
He told me to cheer him up

494
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,600
Sorry

495
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,840
I was amazed

496
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,000
Right

497
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,680
Yes

498
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,480
Too

499
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,160
Sorry

500
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,240
How come
