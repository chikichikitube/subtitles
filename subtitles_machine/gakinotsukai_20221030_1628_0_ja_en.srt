1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,620


2
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,540
.

3
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,100


4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,700


5
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,340


6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,720
You picked up a

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,740
hungry,

8
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,140
hungry tonkatsu.

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,140
I can't do it.

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,140
Are you reading the same thing?

11
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,140
What kind of coincidence is this?

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,140
I'm scared.

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,140
Be quiet.

14
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,140
Can you stop doing this to me?

15
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,140
My whole heart is ruined.

16
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
You're blabbering.

17
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:58,140
It's a coincidence.

18
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,140
It's a coincidence.

19
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,140
I can't bear it.

20
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
You can't do that.

21
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,140
What's going on?

22
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,440
One, two, three...

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,640
Ouch!

24
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
What's wrong?

25
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
What is it?

26
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
What is it?

27
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
It's a syringe.

28
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
A syringe?

29
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,140
It's noisy.

30
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:43,140
It's a syringe.

31
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,140
What is this?

32
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,140
What is this?

33
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,140
I don't know what it means.

34
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,140
I don't know what it means.

35
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,140
One, two, three...

36
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,140
Ouch!

37
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Can you help me, Hamada?

38
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,140
What?

39
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,140
Please put a syringe on it.

40
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
I'll hold it.

41
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Can you help me, Hamada?

42
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Don't make a sound.

43
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Don't make a sound.

44
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Don't make a sound.

45
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Can you take it off?

46
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:51,140
I don't know what it means.

47
00:05:51,140 --> 00:06:19,140
I don't like it here.

48
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
It stinks.

49
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
What should I do?

50
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:50,140
I'll help you.

51
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,140
It stinks.

52
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,140
What are you doing?

53
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,140
What are you doing?

54
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Be careful.

55
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
What is it?

56
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:35,140
I don't know what it means.

57
00:07:35,140 --> 00:08:03,140
I don't know what it means.

58
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:27,140
I don't know what it means.

59
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:42,140
I don't know what it means.

60
00:08:42,140 --> 00:09:10,140
What?

61
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,140
I'm scared.

62
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm scared.

63
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm scared.

64
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
I'm scared.

65
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,140
Don't move.

66
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
OK.

67
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
Don't move.

68
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,140
Let's go.

69
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:54,140
I'll hold it.

70
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:06,140
Don't move.

71
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Be quiet.

72
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Don't move.

73
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
Where do you think you're going?

74
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:17,140
Be quiet.

75
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Follow the rules.

76
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,140
It's dangerous.

77
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,140
It's dangerous.

78
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:35,140
That's enough.

79
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:51,140
I don't like it here.

80
00:10:51,140 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm scared.

81
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Don't move.

82
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,140
Put it on yourself.

83
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Put it on yourself.

84
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Look at the screen.

85
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:55,140
It's cold.

86
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,140
I can hear it faintly.

87
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
I'm going crazy.

88
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Don't talk so much.

89
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,140
Don't talk so much.

90
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Don't talk so much.

91
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Don't talk so much.

92
00:12:41,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Don't talk so much.

93
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Don't talk so much.

94
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
It's small.

95
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
It's small.

96
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:38,140
Your nipples are so small.

97
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,140
It's scary.

98
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,140
It's not about the nipples.

99
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Be quiet.

100
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Don't talk so much.

101
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:04,140
Don't talk so much.

102
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,140
What is this?

103
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:19,140
What is this?

104
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,140
It hurts.

105
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
It's spinning.

106
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
It hurts.

107
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,140
That spin is painful.

108
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,140
It looks good.

109
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,140
This is a little better.

110
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,140
This hurts a lot.

111
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
It's not about the left and right.

112
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,140
I'm scared.

113
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,140
I'm scared of my nipples.

114
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Oh, no.

115
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,140
I'm going crazy.

116
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,140
Don't talk so much.

117
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Don't talk so much.

118
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,140
Don't talk so much.

119
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Don't talk so much.

120
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
It hurts.

121
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,140
What is this?

122
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
This is a good flow.

123
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,140
This is good.

124
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Please put this on.

125
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Excuse me.

126
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Please take a good look.

127
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:27,140
Please put this on.

128
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,140
I'm going crazy.

129
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Please put this on.

130
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,140
This is a good flow.

131
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,140
This is a good flow.

132
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
Please put this on.

133
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Please put this on.

134
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:04,140
This is a good flow.

135
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
I'm not confident.

136
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
I'm scared.

137
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
I'm scared.

138
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,140
I'm scared.

139
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:22,140
I'm scared.

140
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I'm going crazy.

141
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:37,140
One, two, three.

142
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
I'm really scared.

143
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm really scared.

144
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,140
I'm really scared.

145
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,140
I'm really scared.

146
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,140
I'm really scared.

147
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
I'm sweating.

148
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:17,140
I'm sweating.

149
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:30,140
I'm sweating.

150
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I don't like this.

151
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:40,140
I don't like this.

152
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
I won.

153
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
I won.

154
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,140
I'm sweating.

155
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,140
I don't like this.

156
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,140
I don't like this.

157
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm sweating.

158
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:10,140
I'm really scared.

159
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,140
I'm going to run away next time.

160
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
I'm going to run away next time.

161
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,140
I'm going to run away next time.

162
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Last one.

163
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Last one.

164
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Why?

165
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,140
Last one.

166
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:42,140
New York and Matsumoto.

167
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
Let's open one by one.

168
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:53,140
Let's open one by one.

169
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,140
What's that?

170
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Let's choose first.

171
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,140
It's a pattern that can be chosen.

172
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
Really?

173
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
Who will go first?

174
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Can you go first?

175
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,140
From Yama-chan.

176
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Put it down.

177
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Put it down.

178
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Put it down.

179
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:57,140
Put it down.

180
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:07,140
1 in 3 minutes.

181
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Which one?

182
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:32,140
This is Matsumoto-san.

183
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:48,140
This is Matsumoto-san.

184
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Let's play rock-paper-scissors with three people.

185
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,140
Let's start with the winner.

186
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,140
There are two here.

187
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,140
I can't do it.

188
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,140
I can't do it today.

189
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,140
That's where the story started.

190
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Rock-paper-scissors with three people.

191
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Rock-paper-scissors.

192
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
I don't like this.

193
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
I don't like this.

194
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
It's not good either.

195
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,140
It's not good either.

196
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,140
It's not a nipple?

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,140
It looks like a face.

198
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140

It hurts!

203
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
You!

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Let's do it.

210
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:44,140
It's a face.

211
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
What is this?
