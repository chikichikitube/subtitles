1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's do it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What do you think about this?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Gakuyo Ballet.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's good.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you play G.O. in Gakuyo?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, I do.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You play soccer.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's too simple.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's too simple.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We can spend some money.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can go to a foreign location.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's go.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's do it.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's money.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's money.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's good.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I like spending money.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I spend it a lot.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's fun.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's a personal matter.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I spend a lot of money.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I spend a lot of money.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I spend a lot of money.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I spend a lot of money.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've never seen G.O. in Gakuyo.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I've heard of it.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've heard of it.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The punishment game I played with my mother.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How much did it cost?

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How much did it cost?

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
7 million yen.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
7 million yen.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's do it.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's do it.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's do it.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's do it.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's do it.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's do it.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Shall we buy it?

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I have money.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have money.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You look alike.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You should buy it.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Shall we buy it?

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You have a meeting, don't you?

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm listening.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We've already decided.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We can go to the meeting.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm fine.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's just buy the money.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's just buy the money.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's just buy the money.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm just kidding.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's fun, right?

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry.

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's fun.

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What is it?

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is it?

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure.

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I...

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to fight with Moriman.

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to fight with him at the Las Vegas.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's good.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you a foreigner?

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes, of course.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A Japanese mizet wrestler.

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A tour guide.

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't find a better place to say that.

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's cool.

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's cool.

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A foreigner who's here to have fun.

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's cool.

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's cool.

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's cool.

79
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But...

80
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But...

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But...

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to do my best at Korakuen Hall.

84
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm Japanese after all.

85
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't spend that much money.

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know if I can do it.

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you mean, you can't?

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, I can't.

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What?

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey.

91
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey.

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

93
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're not good at cutting.

94
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're too round.

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hey.

96
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey.

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The plan is loose.

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, no, no.

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm doing it now.

102
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's okay.

103
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait a minute.

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't spend money.

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't care about the money.

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't care if it's 50,000 or 60,000 yen.

107
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, no, no.

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When you said it was about 10 million, you didn't say anything.

109
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't think I said that.

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No, no, no.

111
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You said it here.

112
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, no.

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When I'm here, everyone's worried about the money.

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll be careful.

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I told them to be honest.

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's something like that.

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Everyone's fine with the money.

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Everyone's saying yes.

119
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really.

120
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you for your hard work.

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you.

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Everyone's saying yes to the money.

123
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I said yes to the money.

124
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You did, didn't you?

125
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, I did.

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Everyone's eating.

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If it's 10 million, we can eat a lot.

128
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What do you want to eat?

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I want to eat the best food in China.

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What kind of food?

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to eat the best food in China.

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's a good idea.

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want to eat a lot.

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's a good idea.

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's a good idea.

136
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's what I want to do.

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Switzerland.

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Can you eat the best food in Tokyo?

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, there is.

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But it's expensive.

141
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's expensive.

142
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can go to China.

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can go to China.

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think that's a good idea.

145
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But I want to eat the best food in a restaurant.

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
These guys are getting angry.

147
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They don't listen to me.

148
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why are you doing this?

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can I talk to you?

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

151
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Again?

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hey.

153
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey.

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What are you doing?

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What?

156
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you going to buy something?

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm worried about the time.

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's okay.

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay.

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go somewhere else.

161
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's go somewhere else.

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go somewhere else.

163
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's go to a crab restaurant.

164
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's a good idea.

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go to a crab restaurant.

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go to a crab restaurant.

167
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go to a crab restaurant.

168
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's buy the price.

169
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's buy the price.

171
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go.

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go to a crab restaurant.

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go to a crab restaurant.

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's.

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's hot.

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's hot.

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Take a look.

178
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's hot.

179
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you play this game every time?

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you play this game every time?

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It was a project where we ate crabs during the meeting.

182
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's a good idea.

183
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's a good idea.

184
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't want it to be a side dish.

185
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Just the crab.

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It wasn't like that.

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Mr. Yoh, look at this crab.

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's so stupid.

189
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mr. Crab Yoh, this is really good.

190
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It keeps coming up.

191
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's good.

192
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's good.

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's good.

194
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's good.

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's hot.

196
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's hot.

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's not worth 10 million yen to go to the south.

198
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's tough.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it's worth 10 million yen.

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll add more.

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right.

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's spicy.

203
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is it okay?

204
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's hot.

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's hot.

206
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is it?

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's hot.

208
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Be careful.

209
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong?

210
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's good.

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to eat some mozuku.

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why are you eating mozuku?

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why are you eating mozuku?

214
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's a lot of it.

215
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey.

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hey.

218
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is good.

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's wrong?

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's taking the boiled one.

221
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hey, Sugahara.

222
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What are you doing?

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What are you doing?

224
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was wondering if this was a good idea.

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What do you mean?

226
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're eating mozuku and you're deciding.

227
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, come home.

228
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When you see Sugahara, everyone is concerned.

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it money?

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Money is fine.

231
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've never complained about money.

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I've never complained about money.

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Really?

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You sound like a drunkard.

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Go away.

236
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm serious.

237
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go away.

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm serious.

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm serious.

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go away.

241
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Good morning.

242
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Good morning.

243
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What's he doing?

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's gone.

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He's gone.

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Eat all of that.

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you.

248
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's get the injured one.

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's get the injured one.

250
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's get the injured one.

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's wrong?

252
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't want the injured one.

253
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's wrong?

254
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want the injured one.

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go home.

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Go home.

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you for your hard work.

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you for your hard work.

259
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Thank you for your hard work.

260
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you for your hard work.

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't know.

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I didn't know you were like that.

263
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I took him out of the house.

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's okay.

265
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's okay.

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Eat.

267
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Eat.

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is grilled cod.

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is this grilled cod?

270
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes.

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's good.

272
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's good.

273
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's good.

274
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll leave it to you.

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's good.

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All right.

277
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The crab...

278
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's wrong?

280
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's have a big crab fight.

281
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But it's not a big crab fight.

282
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What?

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Pickles.

284
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Pickles?

285
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Pickles?

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why don't you eat pickles in a crab fight?

287
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know.

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll have this cucumber.

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why are you eating so much?

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll have a cucumber.

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't want the injured one.

292
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Cucumber is good.

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Bring the menu.

294
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Menu?

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't need the menu.

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm full.

297
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're full, right?

298
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm not full.

299
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There's this much left.

300
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But I can't say it anymore.

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't say it.

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't care about that.

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hey.

304
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What are you eating?

305
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a fish, isn't it?

306
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're still eating?

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why?

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're doing this on purpose.

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're doing this on purpose.

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're doing this on purpose.

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Who is this guy?

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is...

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You know it.

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right.

315
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know.

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What is it?

317
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What is it?

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you eating so much?

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're full.

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Did you eat it all by yourself?

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hey.

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's take a look at each one.

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There's a lot.

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can't do this.

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Right?

326
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Right?

327
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you have an interesting idea,

328
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
it's better to double it or triple it.

329
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've never said anything about money.

330
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Right?

331
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry, but the two of you

332
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
will have to do it with your emotions.

333
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Next week, let's use all the money

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and do it comfortably.

336
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Excuse me.

337
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's hard to eat.

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's hard to eat.

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey, Mr. Hamaya.

340
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes?

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Mr. Hamaya.

342
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What is it?

343
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In the opening song,

344
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
if it's this exciting,

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
it's good enough.

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is this the end?

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's already very exciting.

348
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If we stand like this,

349
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
everyone will jump around.

350
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Isn't this good enough?

351
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's good if we stand like this.

352
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right.

353
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have to say this before I forget.

354
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're trying to run away, aren't you?

355
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There's a punishment game.

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But, Mr. Hamaya,

357
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
it's already very exciting.

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If you keep doing this,

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you'll be like this.

360
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You'll eat mochi and be like this.

361
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You can't do that.

362
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There's a punishment game.

363
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I wonder if it'll be difficult.

364
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Is that so?

365
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I'm starting to move.

366
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
In the real sense,

367
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
in the real sense,

368
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
from morning to night,

369
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
everyone will be on TV.

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't overdo it.

371
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
From morning to night.

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've already decided what to do.

373
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Downtown, 8th anniversary.

374
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Downtown, 8th anniversary.

375
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Downtown, 8th anniversary.

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Everyone will be on TV.

377
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
From morning to night.

378
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's start with the first one.

379
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's getting cold.

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's okay if it's cold.

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Downtown, 8th anniversary.

382
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you forget that.

383
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I didn't mean to make you forget that.

384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I just didn't like the feeling of being tied up like this.

385
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But, it's not like that.

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can't do that.

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What the hell is this?

388
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Who did this?

389
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Who did you do this with?

390
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's a high-profile attitude.

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Who did you do this with?

392
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're an idiot.

393
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're an idiot.

394
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is there anything else?

395
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You have too many things you don't like.

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But, if you don't do things you don't like,

397
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you can't become a punishment game.

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I said this in English.

399
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If you do things you don't like,

400
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you become a punishment game.

401
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's why you want to be happy.

402
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, no, no.

403
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't want to be a punishment game.

404
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You might get sick.

405
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You might get sick.

406
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What?

407
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You might get sick.

408
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Me?

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You might get a chance to play with a dangerous woman.

410
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't want that, do you?

411
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't want to be punished.

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, you'll be punished.

413
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't want to be punished either way.

414
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The three principles of comparison in Japan are

415
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
not to be made, not to be held, not to be brought in.

416
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But, did you know?

417
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Matsumoto-san's...

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Matsumoto-san's...

419
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Non-commentator.

420
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Good evening.

421
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Matsumoto-san, what are the three principles of dandyism?

422
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes.

423
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I want to be a dandy, so please tell me.

424
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You want to be a dandy, don't you, Sora?

425
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Everyone wants to be a dandy.

426
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You want to be a dandy, don't you?

427
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No.

428
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Do you have dandyism in your mind?

429
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I want to be a dandy,

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
but how can I be a dandy?

431
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know.

432
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I see.

433
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But for me,

434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the three principles of dandyism are always there.

435
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do you have dandyism in your mind?

436
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, no.

437
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know.

438
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
More than I have dandyism in my mind,

439
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
dandy is calling me a dandy.

440
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I didn't ask for dandyism,

441
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but dandy came to me.

442
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Isn't that completely different?

443
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hmm...

444
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you understand?

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So dandy came to you.

446
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, dandy came to me.

447
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So you don't have your own three principles.

448
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't have them,

449
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but I want to tell the children of the future,

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
this is what dandyism is.

451
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What is dandyism?

452
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I want to tell them not to leave it.

453
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I see.

454
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Do you understand?

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes, I understand.

456
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It will enter the 21st century.

457
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If I die like this,

458
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
dandyism in the 20th century will be over,

459
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but dandyism in the 21st century will be gone.

460
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I see.

461
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was very sad about that.

462
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So I cried in the kitchen.

463
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You should have cried in a bigger place.

464
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You should have told us at the end.

465
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
These three principles and dandyism are very similar.

466
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They are similar.

467
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can say that they are almost the same.

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I see.

469
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But on top of that,

470
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
there is a word called poop.

471
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What is dandyism?

472
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can say it.

473
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
First, it means not to make.

474
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is dandyism.

475
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You can't take poop with you.

476
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You have to take it out more and more.

477
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What is dandyism?

478
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What is dandyism?

479
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You can't say it.

480
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You understand this, right?

481
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

482
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Not to make.

483
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Not to take.

484
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Not to take.

485
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You can't take poop with you.

486
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can't take poop with you.

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What is dandyism?

488
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can't take poop with you and say,

489
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Good morning.

490
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's dandyism.

491
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Who would say that?

492
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No one would.

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's what it means, right?

494
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Think about that a little more.

495
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then...

496
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What?

497
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What is the last one?

498
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Not to take.

499
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Not to take.

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
For example, when you're at home,

501
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm a dandy.

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm a dandy.

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A friend comes and says,

504
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, Masumoto!

505
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And he takes poop with him.

506
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And he says,

507
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, come in!

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Who would say that?

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I have poop with me!

510
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll say it at the station show in town.

511
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You have poop with you, don't you?

512
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What does your house look like?

513
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't like it.

514
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
First of all,

515
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
First of all, you don't open the door.

516
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't press the open button.

517
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's...

518
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's not just you, it's everyone.

519
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I think the person who protects these three is a dandy.

520
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Everyone?

521
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Everyone?

522
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Everyone?

523
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm protecting you.

524
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're not protecting me.

525
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
When did you take it?

526
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I've never taken it.

527
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You're saying weird things.

528
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I've never taken it.

529
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Then the guest is good.

530
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You can be a dandy.

531
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Wait a minute.

532
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why?

533
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll press the dandy button.

534
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Press me, too.

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
To Yoyogi Park.

536
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's fine.

537
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Why did you have to go to Yoyogi Park?

538
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's Yoyogi Park.

539
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You have to press it one by one.

540
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, you're a dandy.

541
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, you're a dandy.

542
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What's this?

543
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Wait a minute.

544
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What's this?

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If you don't have poop with you, don't you?

546
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What are you talking about?

547
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, you're a dandy.

548
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But I can't press it for you.

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why?

550
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I've never had poop with me.

551
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Press the dandy button.

552
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Press the dandy button.

553
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I have it.

554
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Press the dandy button.

555
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You have it.

556
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't have it.

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You just don't have it now.

558
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You used to have poop with you, too.

559
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Think about it.

560
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You don't have poop with you.

561
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You've never been to the scene, have you?

562
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I've never been to the scene.

563
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's because I'm getting used to it.

564
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But I always have it on my day off.

565
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I've never seen you.

566
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes, I've been to your house.

567
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I've been to your kitchen.

568
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I've got all the families.

569
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
In America, each typhoon has a name like Mitchie, Johnny.

570
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If the typhoon in Japan had a name like Nino Matsumoto, what would the first one be?

571
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I see.

572
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Japan is lame.

573
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They really don't have a sense of humor.

574
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Ah, is that so?

575
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
After all, Americans think that they can play with a typhoon, right?

576
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,000
They think that they can get caught in it, right?

577
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
If it's that kind of name...

578
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
As expected, Americans think like that, right?

579
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Japanese people are scared of typhoons, so they say,

580
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Tojimari, be careful!

581
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Listen to the typhoon information well!

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Are you serious?

583
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No, I'm serious!

584
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's really good!

585
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's big, it's small, it's a little small...

586
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What kind of way of saying that is?

587
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Eh, isn't there a name for Japan?

588
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If it's number 16...

589
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Ah, what number?

590
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What number is it?

591
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Before number 16,

592
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What kind of typhoon came out?

593
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Number 15!

594
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's just like that!

595
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What is that?

596
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If it comes next time, it's number 17!

597
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If it comes next time, it's number 18!

598
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
No, it's number 18!

599
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What do you mean, no?

600
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, it can't be left out.

601
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It can't be left out?

602
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It can't be left out!

603
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It can't be left out?

604
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm angry about that.

605
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What about the name?

606
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Put it in front of me!

607
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You really shouldn't have said that.

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You're angry, but you don't know?

609
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't know!

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You put in a name!

611
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, eh...

612
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Mr. President!

613
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This year's typhoon, Mr. President!

614
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Can't you say it like that, Mr. President?

615
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A big one, a really big one...

616
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Mr. President!

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The typhoon of the wave...

618
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Mr. President!

619
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can't you say it like that?

620
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Even if it comes up to number 17,

621
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
how are you going to put it on?

622
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Even if you say it, there's nothing left.

623
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There's a lot, right?

624
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President...

625
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But it's not like that anymore!

626
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Mr. President!

627
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Mr. President!

628
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I can't say it.

629
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Why can't you say it?

630
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Why can't you say it now?

631
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Mr. President...

632
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
In Okinawa, in the southwest,

633
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Mr. President is coming now.

634
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This year's President is scary, so please be careful.

635
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Mr. President has finally turned into a typhoon.

636
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The secretary has turned into a woman.

637
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Mr. President has turned into a typhoon.

638
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's the answer to the actual question!

639
00:23:39,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I know!
