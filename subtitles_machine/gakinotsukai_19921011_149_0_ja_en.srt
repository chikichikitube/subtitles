1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Special for 4 hours.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What the hell is this?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The second time, we're going to do it seriously.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The entertainer, are you ready?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Grand Prix!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the second time.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let me introduce you first.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mr. Mahoto Otake!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Next to him is Mr. Tenme Kano!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the last one is Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today's question is heavy.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think you can do it without mosaic.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know if you say that.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What mosaic?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You'll write your name here, right?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There's no mosaic here?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes, that's right.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's too much, too much.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But there's no mosaic here, is there?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first question is this!

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He's popular, but he's ugly when you look at him.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What's with this ugly face?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why are you so popular?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's weird.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You look like a monkey.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There are a lot of talents like that.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Please.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't think of a name.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Please explain it to me.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First of all, Mr. Otake's answer.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
First of all, I asked you to ride a horse.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's obvious.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's a monkey?

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A monkey is a guy with a banana-looking face.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Who is that?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The most popular guy in Rock.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Kubota!

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Kubota Toshinobu!

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I see.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're cleaning up with a monkey.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mr. Tenme.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Kubota was in the Japanese Army at first.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're lying.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mr. Ishida.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's the third one.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's got a shy face.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's got a silly face.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Finally, Mr. Matsumoto.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is definitely true.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm right.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yuji Oda.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I see.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's no mistake.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's just a potato brother.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please see the correct answer.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yuji Oda.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Noriuki Makihara.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Otsurugitan.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yuji Oda.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's like a gorilla.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hiroshi Hase.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Toshiro Yanagi.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Noriuki Makihara.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mr. Otsurugitan.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yuji Oda.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's got a human-looking face.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yuji Oda.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hiroshi Fusei.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Toshiro Yanagi.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's got a chicken-looking face.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yuji Oda.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Makihara.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He's got a big mouth.

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Otsurugitan.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Otsurugitan.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Otsurugitan.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The correct answer is Otsurugitan.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The society is worse.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The society is the same.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I thought it was a guitar.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I thought it was a guitar.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The society is not the same.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I thought it was Noriuki Makihara.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I thought it was Noriuki Makihara.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is Otsurugitan popular?

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's in a trendy drama.

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Otsurugitan is the correct answer.

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you going to do when you're together?

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
With a guy who's in a bad mood.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't like this show.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Here's the next question.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
An actress with a big neck.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're good at acting.

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't be stupid.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're good at acting.

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mr. Tenmei.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's got a big mouth.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There are a lot of actresses.

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Please draw an actress with a big neck.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're good at drawing.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you going to do when you're together?

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Otake looks like he's got a big neck.

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's good.

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's good.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is not good.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Otake first.

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
An actress with a big neck.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Get out of the way.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I got it.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I got it.

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Next, Mr. Tenmei.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's obvious.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Does he have a big neck?

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't want to see him.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I think everyone goes to work after watching that channel.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's scary.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Last one.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm good at drawing.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You look like you're going to get a big neck.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know how strict he is.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You look like you're going to act.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're pretty good at drawing.

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Here's the answer.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Kashiwabara.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yoshie.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Iwasita Shima.

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Kato Reiko.

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Koyanagi Rumiko.

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Takesaki Eiko.

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Koyanagi Rumiko.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Iwasita Shima.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Kato Reiko.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Kashiwabara Yoshie.

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Maeda Bibari.

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Koyanagi Rumiko is getting bigger and bigger.

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Kato Reiko.

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Koyanagi Rumiko.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Kato Reiko.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Koyanagi Rumiko.

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's all for today.

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Last time, I was asked by Tokojyozu Taisho,

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Koyanagi Rumiko.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can hear that you can't use anything but the bed.

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not saying that.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think he's a very nice person.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to act.

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think he's a very nice person.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you going to say that again?

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't help it.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Here's the next question.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
A talent that looks like he's going to be a model.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're a model, aren't you?

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please welcome Otake.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Did you all write it?

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, from Otake.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's Tokumitsu, isn't it?

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Toku-san, did you write it at that age?

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I...

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tamori-san.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Kameoka Ryutaro.

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I see.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now, let's see the correct answer.

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Here we go.

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Tantan's Natsumoto-san.

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000

Karasawa-san.

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Kataoka Tsureta.

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jimio Onishi.

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Gobuhei?

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Nanoshiro-san.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Makihara's Ryuuki.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Kase-taishi-san.

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Machan.

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okama-poi.

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Jimio Onishi.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Kase-taishi.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Makihara-san.

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Machan.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Jimio Onishi-san.

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Jimio Onishi.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Machan.

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Makihara-san.

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Kase-taishi.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Machan.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okama-poi.

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Jimio Onishi-san.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But, there is no way.

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So, the correct answer will be the buryin Yuuki.

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Y status is Oh knew Shin-Uros Samei.

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The correct answer is the same because there is a different one to the answer you chose.

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Then...

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What about the correct answer of Tsukihisa?

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Ok, this is the last question!

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The question is...

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What the hell is going on?

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What the hell is going on?

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What the hell is going on?

203
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ladies and gentlemen

204
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sure everyone listens to you in the rain

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You don't have anywhere to go

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But the other day, I rented an apartment in Osaka

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I rented an apartment in Osaka and paid for it

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why?

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why did you leave an apartment in Osaka when you lived in Tokyo?

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's talk about it from there

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then listen

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When I left Osaka and Tokyo, I also paid for the apartment

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You didn't pay for it, you left it

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why did you leave it?

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I had to pay two rents

217
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why did you come so suddenly?

218
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a TV show

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why did you come so suddenly?

220
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why did you come so suddenly?

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why did you leave it?

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you don't have an apartment in Osaka, you have to get a hotel

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
when you come back from work

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's what I'm saying

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's not good

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you have such a heart?

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Even if you look like this, you look like a romanticist

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's why you can't call it a hotel

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When you're alone in a hotel, you get excited

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You don't have to be alone when you're alone

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You don't have to sleep

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can't be called a woman in a hotel

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There are a lot of women in the front

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You don't have to worry about it

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The biggest reason is that you can't watch the video when you're alone in a hotel

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You mean the video you like?

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes

239
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You have a video in your hotel

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes, but there are times when I want to stop and watch it

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You want to watch it as soon as possible

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes, I want to watch it as soon as possible

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What did you forget to do?

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I want to watch it as soon as possible

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's right

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I wanted to watch it myself

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then I watched the video for the playlist

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can bring the playlist

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You want to watch a video like that?

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to watch a video like that

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then I watched the video for the playlist

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Then I went to the hotel's TV

253
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't know if I can go

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then I called my friend in front of me

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I called my friend in front of me

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I asked him if he could watch the video for the playlist

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He said he could probably do it

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then I went to the TV

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was able to do it

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I borrowed money from my friend

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I was selling erotic videos for 1000 yen in Osaka

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I bought it and went to the hotel

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You went to the hotel

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I called my friend in front of me

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I heard from Mr. Matsumoto

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He said he was going to install it

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I asked him if he could do it

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
An electrician and a bell boy came into my room

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then I did it

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think I can do it

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I don't know if I can do it

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can you show me a little?

273
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you have a video?

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have a video but I don't have it

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't have anything to show you

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I said I don't have it

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I said I don't have it

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But it came out of my bag

279
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I could see the boy's eyes

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He looked at me and said,

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't have it

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have it but it's not an erotic video

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He looked at me with his eyes

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't have it

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What are you talking about?

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Can you talk like that?

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
After I came back

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I took it out of my bag

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have a video of the hotel

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The video and the erotic video are the same

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I was screaming

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But there was an escalator

293
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I was excited

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's the same

295
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It was hard

296
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I couldn't see it

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I thought about it

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I turned on the TV

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Listen

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You are a fool

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Listen

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't want to go to the hotel

303
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't want to go

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Then I became a star

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What are you talking about?

306
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't take it

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's an erotic video

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's naked

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I bought a bag

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You are spending a lot of money

311
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I bought a bag

312
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I put it in

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's very heavy

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If it was real, it would be like this

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But when I checked in

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's cool

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's connected

318
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's an erotic video

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know what you are talking about

320
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's very heavy

321
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't take it

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't take it

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's an erotic video

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's hard

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The screen is small

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's hard

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm not hard

328
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You are strong

329
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I can't take it

330
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You are erotic

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm an erotic person

332
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's talk about my Okamoto

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He is terrible

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He is terrible

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Did you hear the reason why he didn't come to my location?

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why didn't you come?

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When I woke up in the morning, my shoulder was off

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There is no reason

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It took me a long time to get up

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm a bad person

341
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm a bad person

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He was here

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He was here

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The other day

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was shooting a program

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I wanted to go home

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I wanted to prepare a taxi

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I wanted to go by my car

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I didn't have time to prepare a taxi

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I didn't have time to prepare a taxi

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I understand

352
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okamoto, where are you going next?

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
To the right

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okamoto, where are you going next?

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
To the right

356
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Next is to the right

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Go back

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There is no left

359
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why are you going to the right?

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Do you have a big will?

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why are you going to the right?

362
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I understand

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Are you going to the right?

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I was excited

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was excited

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You are really stupid

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was excited

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I was excited

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry

371
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry

372
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry

375
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry

376
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry

377
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You are stupid

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This guy

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This guy had sex with me

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You are lying

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This guy

382
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you mean by that?

383
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What happens when you wake up in the morning?

384
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't think you understand my explanation.

385
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You don't understand my explanation.

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm still in a bad mood.

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Are you angry?

388
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No, I'm not angry.

389
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What happens when you wake up in the morning?

390
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
When I wake up?

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

392
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Like this.

393
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No, no. You should try sleeping.

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You should try sleeping.

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Why do you want to wake up?

396
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You're sleeping, aren't you?

397
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's how you sleep?

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, yes.

399
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, that's fine.

400
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And then?

401
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, you woke up.

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's not good.

403
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're not out of it yet.

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not out of it yet.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You're not out of it yet.

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What happens when you're out of it?

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If I don't stretch, I can't wake up.

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm like this.

409
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You're not out of it yet.

410
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If I don't stretch, I can't wake up.

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Don't make a face like when you're talking about sleep.

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm not out of it yet.

413
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But you understand.

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm not out of it yet.

415
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hold it like this.

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Why don't you hold it like this?

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you don't hold it like this, you'll be in trouble.

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What are you talking about?

419
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What happens if you don't hold it like this?

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What happens if you don't hold it like this?

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, I see.

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's scary.

423
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hold it like this.

424
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If you do this, you'll be in trouble.

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you know how to get out of it?

426
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a habit.

427
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like you always do.

428
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Like this.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like this.

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Like this.

431
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Like this?

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yes, yes.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then?

434
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Like this.

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Like this.

436
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Like this.

437
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I want to eat poop.

438
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Here you go.

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I had two of these when I was a kid.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes.

441
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Which one do you want?

442
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This one.

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is the only one.

444
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There's nothing in the letter.

445
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What is Soviet?

446
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm from the North.

447
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What do you mean by the North?

448
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Aren't you from the North?

449
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And there's nothing in the letter.

450
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What's the pen name?

451
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know.

452
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:41,000
In the theme song of the TV anime, Doraemon, there's a line that goes,

453
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
An An An, I love Doraemon very much.

454
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What does An An An mean?

455
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Here you go.

456
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Do you need to repeat it three times?

457
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Here you go.

458
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It means the love for Doraemon.

459
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The love for An An An?

460
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Actually, this is a children's show, so you can't do that kind of thing.

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's why it's called An An An.

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But in the adult world, Doraemon means An An An.

463
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
An An An, Doraemon, shut up!

464
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
In the announcement of the train, there's always something like,

465
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Next stop is the station, subway, transfer, and so on.

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But why do you say it in such a dirty way?

467
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't say it in such a dirty way.

468
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It sounds like it's stuck in your nose.

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Next stop is the station, transfer, and so on.

470
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It sounds like you have something in your stomach.

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Next stop is the station, transfer, and so on.

472
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It sounds like you have something in your stomach.

473
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It sounds like it's stuck in your nose.

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Next stop is the station, transfer, and so on.

475
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What's that?

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I was the most angry on the plane.

477
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What happened on the plane?

478
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There was a brown-haired person on the plane.

479
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
All foreigners are brown-haired.

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There's a brown-haired person who talks a lot.

481
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
His head is like this.

482
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh!

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's like the character in Jump, Tar-chan.

484
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
He was on the plane, and he was reading a story.

485
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He was sitting diagonally behind him.

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
A young woman was sitting behind him.

487
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He was sitting under a juice, like a receipt.

488
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And he was writing something on the coaster.

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He was like a love letter.

490
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And he was reading a love letter.

491
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And he told the girl to give him the love letter.

492
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And the girl who gave him the love letter told him to sit down.

493
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And he said, Tar-chan, sit down and smile.

494
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I was looking at her with a little annoyed face, but when I got there, everyone was going out, and my mother was always there.

495
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Until that woman came, I was waiting for the bomber.
