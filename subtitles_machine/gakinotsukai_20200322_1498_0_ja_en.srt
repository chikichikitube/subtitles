00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukaiya, we'll be doing a 24 hour long interview with Sanshiro Okobiya!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is a bit scary.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Scary?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've had a few drinks with him before, but he's really dark.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is that so?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If he didn't become a comedian, he'd be making a time bomb.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's about it.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's dangerous.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's welcome our guest today, Mr. Haizawa!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Good morning!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How do you feel about this project?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When I first got the offer, I was really happy.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But when I tried it, I didn't want to do it again.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It was really hard.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't remember it because I've been doing it for 24 hours.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think I said something ridiculous.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm doing a great job in the end.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sanziro, Komiya. 24 hours long interview.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The challenge stage is a hotel in Asakusa.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The next day

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Money...

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Money...

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's wrong?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I forgot my wallet.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You forgot your wallet?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How are you feeling today?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm feeling good, but the pollen is a bit...

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a bit painful.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I think it's a medicine for the liver.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I feel a little dizzy.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I thought it was 24 hours.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's hard to check.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sorry.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A 24-hour long interview will be held in this hotel's medical room.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'd like to hear your story.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm Kunikado.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm a media person.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The interview will be based on this year's report.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They will talk about their life and future.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today, we will ask you to answer honestly.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How are you feeling today?

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have a little bit of a hard time with pollen.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't take any medicine for pollen.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But it was really hard to drink, so I felt sleepy.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I felt tired.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think I was in the school.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are crazy.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm from the countryside.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How was your first child, Komiya?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I wonder how it was like when I was a baby.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was told that I was cute.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hironobe Komiyama was born on September 3, 1983.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He was a little boy, so I was happy to have him wear a high-heeled kimono.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What kind of house did you live in?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I lived in a one-bedroom apartment.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I also ran an apartment.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have a house and 6 apartments.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It was a rich family environment.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When I asked about his parents,

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What was your father like?

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Not so much.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't have memories with my father.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't talk much at home.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Your father was scary?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He wasn't scary or anything. I didn't talk much.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I kept a distance.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't talk much.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now, I'd like to ask about your mother.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My mother.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What kind of person was she?

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I didn't talk to my mother at all.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You didn't?

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I lost my mother when I was in the first grade of high school.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was told to study all the time.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't have much memory with your parents.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Did you live separately?

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, we lived together.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes, it's the same.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My grandparents' house was about 20 meters away from here, so I always went to my grandparents' house.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
His parents were busy working together.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He couldn't shorten the distance between his parents and his children, so he went to kindergarten.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Did you have many friends in kindergarten?

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I didn't.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I remember I was always with the head teacher in kindergarten.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why?

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was alone in the school's health room and crying.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What did you talk to the head teacher and the health teacher?

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was very angry with the female teacher.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I started to hate him since then.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He didn't talk to me like a woman.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I thought he was my friend.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But he was totally different.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I really hated him.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
From then on, I became a woman and a man.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is that?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A woman.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He became a man and entered elementary school.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Did you have any trauma in elementary school?

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, I was bullied.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How should I say it...

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Since when?

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Since the second half of my elementary school.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What did they do to you?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They put a land cell in my generator.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I couldn't take it out.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,160
So they took out the land cell by

113
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,160
I was asked to come here and take a picture.

114
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,160
The girl you were bullying may be watching TV right now.

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Please say something to the camera.

116
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Well, at that time, everyone was higher.

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm already higher.

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Thank you for your hard work.

119
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Thank you for your hard work.

120
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Are you okay?

121
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
I'm okay.

122
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
I feel bad.

123
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,160
I hope you live happily and take care of your family.

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Are you okay?

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
I feel strange.

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm scared of the ending.

127
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
If you don't like it, look at me and laugh.

128
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I'll let the past go.

129
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I'm an adult now, so I'll go with this.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I thought he'd use only good parts, but he used all of them.

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
He did a lot of patterns.

132
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Two hours have passed since the start.

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
The interviewer will now take over.

134
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
He will have lunch with me.

135
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Oh, it's coke.

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Huh? Is it coke?

137
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Say something.

138
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
What? Which one is it?

139
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Hey, hey, did you drink coke?

140
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
You shouldn't ask such a thing.

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
It's a special type of food.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Please try the steamed chicken and the maitake salad.

143
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Please enjoy.

144
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
I don't like this.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
It's so good.

146
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's so good.

147
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
What kind of food do you usually eat?

148
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I eat soft food.

149
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I don't have teeth.

150
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
I don't eat much.

151
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
You don't eat much?

152
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
I don't eat much.

153
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
I don't eat much.

154
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I don't eat much.

155
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Oh, really?

156
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Eh?

157
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Wait a minute.

158
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I don't have a tooth.

159
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
You're really slow.

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
He's going to the right.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
He doesn't have a left.

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I don't have a tooth.

163
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Wait a minute.

164
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I have an interview.

165
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
See you later.

166
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
He's getting a little annoyed.

167
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
You should have made it curry.

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
No!

169
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I like it.

170
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I like chicken.

171
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm being teased.

172
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I have to do an interview. Can you eat a little faster?

173
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
I can't do it.

174
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
It's the worst.

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Next, let's talk about the middle school days.

176
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,160
After the junior high school entrance exam, Komia entered a famous private junior high school.

177
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,160
In elementary school, you were bullied badly.

178
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,160
How was the bullying in junior high school?

179
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
There was bullying.

180
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I was told that I would not be able to eat the eraser.

181
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I was given an eraser and I was allowed to eat it.

182
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
During basketball time, I was given a pass.

183
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I didn't know that I would not get a pass.

184
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I was being teased a lot.

185
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I was teased a lot.

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
I was teased a lot.

187
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Komiya became friends with a teased character.

188
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
In the school event held at the beach,

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,160
he was shocked by his partner Aida.

190
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,160
At the beach school, everyone was doing something.

191
00:10:49,160 --> 00:11:01,160
I think of the parody of Mr. Beta from Downtown.

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
The parody was really interesting.

193
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
It was amazing.

194
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
I don't know if it was because my parents were strict, but

195
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I watched Downtown's program because there was no scene until high school students started.

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
No, no, no, it's my parents.

197
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
I like Uchiyama-chan, but I like Downtown.

198
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,160
And then, I started talking to him and we became friends.

199
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Why did you not like Downtown's program?

200
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
There are no pieces of the heart.

201
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
It's my parents.

202
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Even if your parents say it, you have your own way of saying it.

203
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Did you have a crush on anyone?

204
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
In junior high?

205
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I was in love with a class teacher, Madonna.

206
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Did you approach her?

207
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I was in the third grade of junior high school.

208
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I was in the first class.

209
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
There were only four boys in the first class.

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Three out of four girls had a girlfriend.

211
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I was left out of the class.

212
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
I said, I want to be in it too.

213
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
She said, you're not in it.

214
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
So I said, I am in it too.

215
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
But I was really there.

216
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
The class's madonna.

217
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
I said, then confess.

218
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Of course, I like it too.

219
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,160
I went on a school trip to Okinawa.

220
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
There was a male cottage and a female cottage.

221
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
There was a big tree in the middle.

222
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I said, let's meet there at night.

223
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
To the girl.

224
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
The girl came and I went too.

225
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
I went to see her, but she said,

226
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
What?

227
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I said,

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Just enjoy your trip to Okinawa.

229
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
That was it.

230
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I was looking at the footage from the cottage.

231
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I didn't know what was going on.

232
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
So the girl went home, and I went home too.

233
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Everyone was at the cottage.

234
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
I asked, How was it?

235
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
They said, It was nothing.

236
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
They said, You were dating her?

237
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
I thought, I could go.

238
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I said, I dated her.

239
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I thought I was dating her.

240
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I thought I wouldn't be found out because we weren't that close.

241
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I thought I would be found out someday, but I was fine.

242
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,160
One day, it was about six months later,

243
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,160
There are girls who come to class with their faces in any case.

244
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,160
That person was crying next to the window.

245
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
We came to the ground together.

246
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
All the girls in the class were there, surrounded by circles.

247
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I said, get inside the picture!

248
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:45,160
In the middle of the picture, there was a liar, a scumbag, an idiot, a scumbag

249
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,160
One person said bad things about me

250
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
I said I would never talk to them again

251
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
And from there, I became a member of the group

252
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
You were watching it?

253
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I was watching it

254
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
From above

255
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I was watching the people surrounded me

256
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,160
You said you lied for half a year, but all the men were lying, right?

257
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,160
In the end, I lied because I wanted to join the first army.

259
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
In the end, it's the same for everyone, both men and women.

260
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,160
So I never talked about it, but I've never talked about a fat man in the 5th army.

261
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
You said 5th army.

262
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
I'm really fat in the 5th army.

263
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
You're so discriminating!

264
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Three hours have passed since the start.

265
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,160
After the meal, Komiya heads to the city of memories from his school days.

266
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
I'll continue to talk about the car.

267
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Please tell me about your hobbies from middle school.

268
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Hobbies?

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
My hair was really curly.

270
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:58,160
So, I think it was my hobby to read magazines and see their hair.

271
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Was it like that around you?

272
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,160
It was like a city school in Tokyo. There were many kids who were mixed up.

273
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,160
The place where he came was Chetagaya-ku, Seijo, where he spent his high school days.

274
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:22,160
At the coffee shop in front of the station, he gave an interview from his high school days.

275
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,160
I heard that you had a big shock when you were in the first year of high school.

276
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Yes, my mother passed away.

277
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
It was quite a shock.

278
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Well, yes.

279
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:43,160
After all, my grandparents were closer to me, so I didn't get that much shock.

280
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,160
It was so sudden that he couldn't realize what was happening.

281
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Yes.

282
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,160
I thought that people would die any time.

283
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,160
So I stopped studying.

284
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I thought that if I studied, I would die.

285
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,160
So I thought I didn't have to study.

286
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Because of his mother's death, he stopped studying at all.

287
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,160
As a result, he was in high school for two years.

288
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Were you embarrassed?

289
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm not embarrassed. Everyone was satisfied with me.

290
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I was called in the shadows.

291
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
What kind of story was that?

292
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,160
I was hungry, so I went into the living room.

293
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,160
I was sorry that I was coming out very quickly.

294
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,160
I was in a coma, so I couldn't say anything.

295
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I couldn't get out of there.

296
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
It was awkward.

297
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,160
He was a member of the National Police Department.

298
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
He was chosen by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police and was working hard.

299
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,160
But there was an incident when he was in the third grade of high school.

300
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Shukichi was a student from kindergarten to university.

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Everyone used the playground.

302
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
It was a school playground for elementary school students.

303
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
There was a club room next to it.

304
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,160
I felt sorry for changing clothes in the club room.

305
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
I was changing clothes in front of the club room.

306
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,160
When I was changing, a boy came through the door.

307
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,160
He took off his clothes and smiled.

308
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
He took off his clothes and smiled.

309
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
He chased me in the trunk.

310
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
He ran away.

311
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Two days later, he came to school with his mother.

312
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
He said a reporter had appeared.

313
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,160
He chased me in the trunk.

314
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I had a blonde hair and had fox eyes.

315
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
I wanted to catch it.

316
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I was asked to gather the blonde eyes.

317
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
I was asked to gather the blonde eyes.

318
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
My mother told my child,

319
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I was the last one.

320
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I was able to twist my face.

321
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I told my brother,

322
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I was doing something like that.

323
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Then, the rumor was revealed to the whole school.

324
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Everyone misunderstood and scolded me.

325
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I fell down and I had a toothache.

326
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Six hours have passed since the beginning.

327
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Interview at the park of memories in the hope of Komiya.

328
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Wow, the pollen is amazing. Why did I choose this place?

329
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
It's a memorable park, isn't it?

330
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
This place is a bit...

331
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
That pollen...

332
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:05,080
It's a bit of a

333
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
What is this place?

334
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Oh really?

335
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
This place is...

336
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh, I see. It's just my imagination.

337
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I just thought of it.

338
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
But this park is amazing.

339
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Is this a memorable park?

340
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Yes, it is.

341
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
This is the place where I went into the fairy-tale castle

342
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,080
and we had a meeting to discuss the ideas for the live show.

343
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,080
At the high school festival, they performed comedy and comedy.

344
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,080
That was the reason why they became comedians.

345
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,080
After graduating from high school, they went to the comedy school of the people who had the talent.

346
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
They were the most talented in the school.

347
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,080
However, Yoshimoto's combination made the situation different.

348
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
What was the most popular show at Yoshimoto's request?

349
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Oriental Radio.

350
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,080
It was 3 against 3, Oriental Radio.

351
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,080
It was like a multi-battle.

352
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,080
We did the story and thought we got it.

353
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,080
But then Oriental Radio came out and we were defeated.

354
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Oriental Radio was the momentum of Hachiku.

355
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,880
I thought I didn't have a good sense for it.

356
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,080
So I decided to quit.

357
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,580
However, he didn't give up on his dream of becoming a comedian.

358
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,080
He became a freelancer and worked at Trio.

359
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Trio was closed for about a year, but then Aida and Sanshiro were formed again.

360
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,080
After working for about 5 years as a freelancer, he went to Maseki Entertainment, his current agency.

361
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,080
9 hours have passed since the start.

362
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,080
We return to the hotel and ask about the reason why Komiya broke up.

363
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,080
What was the reason for breaking up?

364
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
It was a TV Tokyo program where comedians were chosen.

365
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,080
It was a program where comedians were chosen.

366
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,080
They were ranked first and they voted for me.

367
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Could you tell us more about the recording?

368
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Two days ago, I fell down and hurt my teeth.

369
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I also had a bone fracture in my knee.

370
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
I was in the wheelchair.

371
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I was going to do a full-time job, but I couldn't do it.

372
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I felt like it was over.

373
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,080
I think it was good to think of it now.

374
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
It was a very good student.

375
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:56,080
The appearance of the impact and the excellent performance called for a reputation, and gradually the TV exposure increased to the rep game.

376
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,080
And the longing from the school days, the co-star of Downtown.

377
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,080
What kind of existence is downtown for you?

378
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Hmm...

379
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Oasis.

380
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,080
I was bullied in high school.

381
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,080
I watched DVDs and they made me digest them.

382
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
So, Oasis.

383
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,080
I was a real pervert in class.

384
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,080
I was laughing at the very sharp downtown DVDs of that time.

385
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm not a criminal who is against society.

386
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
That's not true.

387
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,080
You don't get along with the members of the group.

388
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
No, I don't.

389
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Mr. Kawada.

390
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
What?

391
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,080
To be honest, I'm sorry to say this, but...

392
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,080
I look like the person who bullied me when I was a student.

393
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
His face is so similar to mine.

394
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Matsumoto-san, how do you feel about this?

395
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,080
This time, you're drinking with a person you've met before.

396
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Ah, but now that you mention it, I thought I said that before.

397
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Anyway, I'm talking about the lack of quality of downtown.

398
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
You said that before.

399
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
But I feel like I was told that before.

400
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
There are times when you don't have the quality.

401
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I bullied him when he was a student.

402
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,580
The person and Hamada-san's visual, hair, and body position are all the same.

403
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,080
Isn't that me?

404
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,580
The way he throws the land cell in the train, that's the funniest.

405
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
It's the same, right?

406
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
This part is the most funny.

407
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,580
Next week!

408
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,580
That's not cool.

409
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,580
24 hour long interview, the end!

410
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm going to be a monkey in the morning and night.

411
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,580
A storm of bomb remarks.

412
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm going to die now.

413
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,580
Will it be possible to do it for 24 hours?
