1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A-Generation!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hey, what's wrong?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My nails are peeling off.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Really?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Really? Why?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It hurts a lot.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I got a team fight yesterday.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Really?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You should have put something that's not here.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Stop it.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Just coming here is scary.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No, no, no.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's why...

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll do it here.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You shouldn't put something that's here.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It hurts here.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm wearing a double.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My back hurts too.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't know about that.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can't do it.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You really shouldn't be careful.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I shouldn't be careful.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll die.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's not it.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You should be careful.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You shouldn't be like this.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't get it.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm worried about you.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm worried about you.

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When I was doing Ryoma, my nails were like this.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I cut my boots here.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's this?

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I put black magic on my boots.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's...

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're a genius idiot.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There's a cover on your chest.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You shouldn't do that.

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You'll get hurt.

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you listening?

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My back hurts.

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't care about your black magic.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's not black magic.

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know if you want to say that you did your best.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's not it.

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's why you're a genius idiot.

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's not the era of Spokon.

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Spokon?

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's okay.

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Take it off.

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Take it off.

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I can take it off.

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll take it off from now on.

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You'll get hurt.

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll get hurt.

58
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You'll get hurt.

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You'll die too.

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why?

61
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're a genius idiot.

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're a genius idiot.

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, really.

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's hard.

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't help it.

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's wrong with your back?

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know.

68
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you too tired?

69
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't use my back much.

70
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What?

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are you a tuna?

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're a tuna.

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm a tuna.

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Really?

76
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're a tuna too.

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We're both tuna.

78
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm just going to sleep.

79
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My girlfriend is a super tuna.

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are you angry?

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you angry?

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't like it.

83
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I understand that you're a little angry.

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's like you were prepared.

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're saying that I'm not good enough.

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not good enough?

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, well, well.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't you think it's a lie?

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What?

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That I don't have a mirror.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A mirror?

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sure it's a lie.

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I get it.

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't need a movie.

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If that's the case, buy me a phone.

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Tell me what you're talking about.

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll cut it here.

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you get cut, don't talk.

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to talk.

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're going to die.

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're going to die.

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're going to die.

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to kill you.

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to put you in a trunk and take you somewhere.

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Nakamura.

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have a question for the younger brother of the Ultra Brothers.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

108
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What did the Ultra Father say to his sons every day?

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's true.

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you were the son of the Ultra Brothers, would you call him your father?

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
My father.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My father used to say that to me.

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My father was a strict person.

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What was your name?

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ultraman.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Look at your face.

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not Ultraman.

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ultraman Curry.

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's Ultraman Curry?

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know.

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know.

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I didn't do it on TV.

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ultraman Curry?

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why didn't you do it?

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's hard to understand.

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ultraman Curry.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I was told it was okay.

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, of course, the people at the station came.

131
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Always with that hand and this hand.

132
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's okay.

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll transform with a pencil case.

134
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Really?

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't do it.

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't do it with a pencil case.

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can't do it with a pencil case.

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I said, whoa!

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I said, whoa!

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't do it.

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I said, whoa!

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm bleeding.

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's complicated.

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't understand why.

146
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't have a TV station.

147
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I forgot the name.

148
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
D told me.

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not a TV station.

150
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Curry-kun.

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sad.

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll be there.

153
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like a story store.

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The boss kept telling me.

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
For the time being, no matter what you do,

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
where are you an Ultra?

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No matter what you do,

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
where are you an Ultra?

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No matter what you do,

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
when I'm flying,

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm like this.

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I thought it was like that.

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's different.

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For example,

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it's a long-distance call.

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm on a long-distance call.

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey!

168
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
At home.

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hey!

170
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm going to hit you!

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's what he said.

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's an old man.

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you pay for it yourself?

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Wait a minute.

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's an old man.

176
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's an Ultra.

177
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey!

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hey!

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you pay for it yourself?

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where are you an Ultra?

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's weird.

182
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's weird.

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm going to go blue.

184
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you tell me that.

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You were hated.

186
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You might have been hated.

187
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You were hidden for a long time.

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's not what an old man does.

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm going to look for it desperately.

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's not there again.

191
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to look for it in the Ultra.

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't understand the meaning.

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I understand the meaning.

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stop it.

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who is that?

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Only curry.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Who is that?

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The mother of the Ultra says.

199
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The mother of the Ultra says.

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm cute even if I'm a curry.

201
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not going to ask you to look for curry.

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll tell you clearly.

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Actually, every year, 24 hours TV broadcast.

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who keeps running alone.

205
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When Akai scored a goal on 24 hours TV.

206
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What did he say?

207
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Did he involve Japan in the chaos?

208
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm nervous when I'm laughing.

209
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I have a lot of tension.

210
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If I tickle him a little, he'll be in trouble.

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right.

212
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you have anything to say?

213
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have anything to say.

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Tell me.

215
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's start with the NG word.

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't usually say this.

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't say it.

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't say it.

219
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Normally.

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't say it.

221
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't say it.

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's different about me from normal is.

223
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I dare to say something that's not funny.

224
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't say it.

225
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll say it.

226
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll say it.

227
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If you don't say it, you can't see the answer.

228
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you understand?

229
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I understand.

230
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go with the NG word.

231
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Akai-san just came back.

232
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When he came.

233
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Peperoncino.

234
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's the NG word.

235
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can't say this.

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But you can't say this.

237
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was going to say it before I said it.

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't go home just because you got it.

239
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Because there was that gesture.

240
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Akai-san's answer is correct.

241
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't say Peperoncino.

242
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's the NG word.

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's correct.

244
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's go.

245
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's the NG word.

246
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't you run like this and come up like this?

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you want to do that, it's okay.

248
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm wearing a yellow T-shirt.

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is Budokan.

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Who are you?

251
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Tokumitsu-san.

252
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I understand.

253
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Akai-san.

255
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He hasn't started yet.

256
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He's in the audience seat.

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
5 seconds left.

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
4, 3, 2, 1.

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Akai-san has arrived at Budokan.

260
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
100 km.

261
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
100 km.

262
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Akai-san has finished his 100 km journey.

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm wearing a yellow T-shirt.

264
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is...

265
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is...

266
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
NG.

267
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's the NG word.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is wrong.

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was surprised.

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was surprised too.

271
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I thought you were a magician.

272
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is that so?

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I thought you were a magician.

275
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I know you're wearing a yellow T-shirt every year.

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really.

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've become a queen.

279
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Who are you?

280
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Who are you now?

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's me.

282
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm a live parent.

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I thought you were a finished product.

284
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Everyone, apologize.

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Apologize properly.

287
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's the NG word.

290
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Go back.

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Masumoto-san, your feet are heavy.

292
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, it's okay.

293
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you okay?

294
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

295
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Akai-san, are you okay?

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Wait a minute.

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There's something strange.

298
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What?

299
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can't do it.

300
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What is it?

301
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's coming from behind.

302
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't know.

303
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's wrong?

304
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What's wrong?

305
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't do it in a better situation.

306
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's okay.

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Of course, the story has already been decided.

308
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I want to take a picture.

309
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to say it, but it's about to explode.

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wait a minute.

311
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Wait a minute.

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm begging you.

313
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
She's wearing a swimsuit.

314
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Please.

315
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Are you okay?

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No one will kick you anymore.

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Please.

318
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What's wrong?

319
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's okay.

320
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Does your stomach hurt?

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
My stomach hurts.

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't say that to a junior high school student.

323
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I hurt my leg.

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I was treated like a transfer student.

325
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

326
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was treated like a transfer student.
