1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to show you how to break the mountain!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What are you doing?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We've been practicing for two weeks.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's going to be tough today.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Look at this!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is not going to be fun.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Idiot!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're in this situation right now.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's better for us to take turns.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we fall, we lose.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we lose...

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's a punishment game.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But we're hiding something like that.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Don't do that!

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I fell!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The quality of laughter is low.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who's the one who can't do it anymore?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please come over here.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Akashiya-san.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Kasuga-san.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Beat Takeshi-san.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Shimada Shinsuke-san.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Nishikawa Kiyoshi-san.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tamori-san.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Uchanan-chan.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who was that?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Bonjama!

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're not going to do that.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're not going to do that.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Bonjama!

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bonjama!

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't think it's true.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But there's someone who thinks it's true.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Who is it?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I didn't get it.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do it again.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Actually, I think...

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who is it?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My hand...

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My hand is going crazy.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is Margaret.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She's in a different place from what she really thinks.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you serious?

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, no.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Who do you think it is?

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why do you want to know?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who is it?

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's this guy!

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This isn't what you think it is.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You don't have any resistance.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, it's clean.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't get it.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's clean.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's gone.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's hot.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's hot.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's hot.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I got it.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Put a sticker on your face saying you drank too much.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
When?

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There was a sushi restaurant I went to before.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It looked expensive.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll put it up there.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In front of the restaurant.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll go, but I won't put it up if I didn't drink too much.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You drank too much.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's because you drank too much.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Where should I put it?

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Here.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Where?

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Like this.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like this?

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Like this?

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can kick your butt, but you can't kick mine.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I kicked it hard.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I had poop on my shoes.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't do this.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you very much.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think that when I do this kind of work, I live in an apartment.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't want to be noticed by the residents of the apartment.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The other day, I rented an apartment in Osaka.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When I was about to leave, I heard a voice.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
From the outside?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
From the outside.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It was from the other side of the door.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I looked through the window.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A man and a woman were hugging each other.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
In front of your room?

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I saw a couple hugging each other in the park.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They didn't do anything.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They didn't move at all.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They were like,

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you a squirrel?

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's right.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They were in the station.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They were in the station, right?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They were in the station.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They were like this.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They didn't talk.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They didn't talk.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What was that?

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
They didn't leave the room.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They didn't leave the room.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't want to be noticed.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When I left the room, they were like,

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is my room.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They were looking at each other.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was looking at them.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They didn't move at all.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What was that?

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't want to be noticed.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They were in the station.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They were in the station.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't want to be noticed.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I wanted to wait a little longer.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was watching TV for about 20 minutes.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I thought it was about time.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I looked at them again.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They didn't kiss.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What was that?

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They didn't move at all.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They didn't move at all.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's worse than that.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's worse than that.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They didn't kiss.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wait a minute.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They didn't kiss.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
How was it?

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Was it hard?

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was hard for both of them.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was hard for both of them.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It was hard.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They didn't move at all.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They didn't do the dance.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was glad they didn't.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I thought they would come out.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I didn't think so.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I often see couples like that.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In the park, in the station.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They are in the station.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There are many ticket shops in the station.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There are.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
A little to the side.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What was the beginning like?

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Until they go to the park?

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've never seen the beginning and the end.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Everyone is at home.

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Everyone is at home.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I see that.

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What was the beginning like?

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They walk to the station.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They walk to the station.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think they will come back.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The woman.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They want to say goodbye.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They want to say goodbye.

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Until they go to the ticket shop.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's the situation.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
From this situation,

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
how do they end?

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In the end,

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
how do they end?

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They can talk.

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They can talk.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How do they end?

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Even if they kiss,

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in the end,

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
how do they end?

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's the situation.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not a preface.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But,

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the ugly couple

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is doing that.

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The competition is terrible.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's like a roundabout.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There is something strange.

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Something...

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What is it?

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There is something like this.

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What is it?

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There is something like this.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There is something like this.

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey!

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a manjigatame.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Manjigatame is funny.

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's funny.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In the past,

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was angry.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In Osaka,

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
from Monday to Friday,

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I was doing a live show.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
At that time,

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was sleeping.

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you know that?

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It was about 41 degrees.

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It was sunny.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It was so hot.

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I didn't know that.

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was sleeping at home.

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then,

211
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the bell rang.

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Who is it?

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It was my grandmother.

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I came here a few times.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But,

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
she was not here.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
When I saw the program today,

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard that I had a fever of more than 40 degrees.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I thought she would be here today.

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Please give me a sign.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It doesn't matter.

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If it's 40 degrees,

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't care who it is.

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't care about this.

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I feel lonely.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I know.

227
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't stand it.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I've never been noticed.

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't look for big things.

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How about now?

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now,

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm in my eighties.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Eighties?

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You are in your eighties.

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm in my sixties.

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You are a mammoth.

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What is that?

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was a child.

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's right.

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The manager is my grandfather and grandmother.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm a little stupid.

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When I first saw it,

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I thought it was here.

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Excuse me.

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How long does it take to get to the station?

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you walk, it takes 10 minutes.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If I walk, it takes 5 minutes.

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why?

253
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's the other way around.

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When I guide her on the stairs,

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
she doesn't come.

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm guiding her when she doesn't come.

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you walk 10 minutes,

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I walk 5 minutes.

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know if you're using your power.

260
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know if she's holding on until she gets to the station.

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you don't walk, you'll be stuck.

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is the time.

263
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a time of change.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to get a heat stroke.

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I can't stand it.

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You've never had a fever of more than 40 degrees.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No.

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I've noticed that I'm getting a habit of getting a heat stroke.

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's been a while.

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When I first got a heat stroke,

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was surprised because I had a fever of more than 40 degrees.

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was so scared that I went home.

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I thought I had a cold,

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but I thought I'd just go to bed.

275
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I couldn't get a fever in three days.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I didn't want to go to the hospital,

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
so I only took cold medicine.

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I was sleeping alone.

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
My father and mother were sleeping next to me.

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I couldn't sleep because I had a fever.

281
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I woke up at 5 o'clock.

282
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know if my mother was sleeping.

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We were talking.

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, we were talking.

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
My father said,

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't think I can do it anymore.

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I couldn't stand it.

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I couldn't move because I had a fever.

289
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
My father said,

290
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't think I can do it anymore.

291
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What did your father think?

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My father said,

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't say such a thing.

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want you to say it.

295
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm thinking about it now.

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is it true?

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm crying.

298
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have a lot of memories of my elementary school days.

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I had a lot of fun.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
My father said,

301
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is a giraffe.

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When I got on the train,

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I got a big problem.

304
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
My grandmother was sitting in my seat.

305
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
My grandmother was like a high-class family.

306
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've seen my grandmother's belongings.

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
She was sitting in my seat.

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When I came, she couldn't sit.

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
She was sitting in my seat.

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't know what to do, but you know, I'm an adult, too.

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm a young man.

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yesterday, my grandma came home.

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
She looked like Masako Ohya.

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
She must have a lot of money.

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
She came home and looked at me.

316
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Huh?

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Her shoes were shining.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is that my seat?

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Are you serious?

320
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are you still interested in Masako Ohya?

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's a strange Masako Ohya.

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sure it's Masako Ohya.

323
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey, doggy.

324
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey, doggy.

325
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I got up and said,

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello, this is my seat.

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hello?

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Is that so?

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is definitely seat number 10.

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I took it off and it was number 11.

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is number 10.

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's number 11.

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's number 10, right?

334
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Number 10, number 11.

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What? I'm surprised.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This is a different car.

337
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is a different car.

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Your story is very interesting.

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, you're so brave.

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're much bigger than when you talked to me before.

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're so brave.

342
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you still angry with me?

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I enjoy watching Osaka while thinking of Osaka.

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You enjoy watching Osaka?

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes, I always do.

347
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was talking to my friend the other day.

348
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When I was talking to him,

349
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I thought, oh, I see.

350
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I saw my mother's legs shining.

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, I see.

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You're the only one who's shining.

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't know what kind of mother I am.

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I can see it.

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
My mother's legs are yellow.

356
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's hard.

357
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's hard.

358
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Mothers get excited easily.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Especially your mother.

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why?

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, my God.

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, my God.

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
When you say that, you can't stop.

364
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, my God.

365
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's true.

366
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I just remembered it.

367
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What?

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I was at the Shimin Festival in Amagasaki.

369
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We were invited to the festival.

370
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We were invited.

371
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And there were so many people on the stage.

372
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
On the other side of the stage,

373
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
there was a dressing room.

374
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I said, Dantan-san, please come in.

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When I went up,

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
next to the stairs to the stage,

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
my father was holding a video from his neck.

378
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I said, long time no see.

379
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He said, yes.

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He brought a camera and a video.

381
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I went up.

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Dantan-san.

383
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
When I went up to the stage,

384
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
my mother was sitting in the middle.

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What?

386
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What?

387
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There were so many seats.

388
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And there was a phone call.

389
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I thought I'd sit there.

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The girl in the front seat

391
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
was standing in line from 3 o'clock in the morning.

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
My mother was there.

393
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What time did you get up?

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's amazing.

395
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And there was a phone call.

396
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, yeah.

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Dantan, do you know what happened the other day?

398
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's wrong with you?

399
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Did you stop the delivery?

400
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
See, my mother didn't say anything.

401
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Get out of the way!

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Get out of the way!

403
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
In front of the child care center,

404
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hama-chan said,

405
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
if you have a yellowtail teriyaki,

406
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you can eat as much rice as you want.

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm trying to see how many times I can eat it.

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No, it's not like that.

409
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's what it is.

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I'll do it in the open room.

411
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll prepare yellowtail teriyaki

412
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and eat as much rice as I want.

413
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No.

414
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No, you can't.

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It doesn't matter where I'm eating.

416
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It doesn't matter.

417
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Did you lie to me?

418
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You can eat as many times as you want.

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's human.

420
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There's a limit.

421
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But it doesn't say how many times you can eat it in two or three times.

422
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If you can eat three times as much as you usually eat,

423
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that's amazing.

424
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How many times is that?

425
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's not how many times.

426
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's three times.

427
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So how many times is that?

428
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How many times do you usually eat?

429
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
About two times on average.

430
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Two times?

431
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
More than that?

432
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
A lot.

433
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a lot these days.

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know.

435
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How much is it?

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Something like this.

437
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's big.

438
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's right.

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's a lot.

440
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can't eat it.

441
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But if it's yellowtail teriyaki,

442
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
that's a different story.

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I cooked a lot of rice in the opening.

444
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Do it properly.

445
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know.

446
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay, okay.

447
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know.

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't know.

449
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know.

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Next time.

451
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He's refusing.

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
No.

453
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Why?

454
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I was talking to my sister the other day,

455
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and we had an argument.

456
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
There was a big mole on Nishimoto's face.

457
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Where was it on his face?

458
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
By the way,

459
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which one was the smaller mole

460
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
of Naomi Chiyaki, Kenji Sawada, and Kenji Nizuma?

461
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's here.

462
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The mole.

463
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Why is it there?

464
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Where is Naomi Chiyaki?

465
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Around here?

466
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Which one was it?

467
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Here?

468
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where is Nishimoto?

469
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think it was here.

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Around here?

471
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Why am I the mole?

472
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Around here.

473
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Nishimoto was here.

474
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And then,

475
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Senma-san was here.

476
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And then,

477
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Atsumi Kiyoshi was here.

478
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Sometimes,

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
there are people who are pitiful.

480
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You can't make a mistake.

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's scary, isn't it?

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What would you do if you were his partner?

483
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm down.

484
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Right?

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why did you put it on?

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You don't have an answer.

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Who else?

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Kuwata.

489
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's Kuwata.

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Kuwata is...

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Kuwata is...

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Kuwata is like this.

493
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's scary.

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hello.

495
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hello.

496
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Today,

497
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
we have a promotion.

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

499
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's do it again.

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Actually, we made this video.

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's called Dantan no Ryu.

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's been a while since we did a manzai.

503
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's a very exciting video.

504
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It costs 4900 yen.

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When will it be released?

506
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It will be released on November 1st.

507
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you can, I want you to buy it.

508
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's give it to the viewers.

509
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes.

510
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
To the viewers.

511
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
How many people are there?

512
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
97 people.

513
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
97 people?

514
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes.

515
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
3 people.

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
3 people?

517
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
3 people.

518
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's really interesting.

519
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes.

520
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I want you to buy it.

521
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We will give it to the viewers.

522
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Here you are.

523
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll give it to you later.

524
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And...

525
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This.

526
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You have to put a sticker on it.

527
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes.

528
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes.

529
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's good, isn't it?

530
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But Akiko...

531
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Your bangs are drooping.

532
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I can't put it on.

533
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can't put it on.

534
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So, you have to put it up.

535
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If you put it on your hair, you can't do it.

536
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You can't do that.

537
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You have to put it down.

538
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What?

539
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If you put it down, it's funny.

540
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But if you put it down, it's not funny.

541
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
As I said earlier, the video's address is the same.

542
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If you want to see it, the address is the same.

543
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Please come here.

544
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll see you next week.

545
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Bye.
