1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The usual dressing room for children.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A peaceful moment before the show.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But now, a man appears with a foreboding of a storm.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's go.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The director, Hidena Sakamoto.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wherever he goes, he is always with his beloved bird.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
His gentle personality and a calm smile always warmly embrace us.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Life itself is happiness.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But his hidden face is about to be revealed today.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's up, Hama-chan?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're so hot.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I wanted to go with you.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You wanted to go with me?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, I did.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where did you go, Machan?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I went to Chocochoco.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Where did you go?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't usually like it this much.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where did you go to Chocochoco?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I went on a trip.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A trip?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I wonder if it's going to be good.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm looking forward to your lunch.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's this?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's going on?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This egg is not here.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's going on?

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's different.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is it good?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's good?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What's good about this bento?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it good?

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not good, is it?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not good?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not good.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not good.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's not good.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it good?

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's well balanced.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's like this.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not good.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Get out of the way.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't like this bento.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ok, let's go.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Today, I'm going to show you guys something delicious.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's this?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to make it for you.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In front of us, a man takes off his veil.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In addition to birds, he also controls fire.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He makes fire dishes.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is what people call him.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is what people call him.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's this?

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to make it for you.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't need it.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't need it.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why are you sleeping?

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, it's in.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's go to the bed.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's this?

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's this?

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know what it is.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's scary.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, hey, hey.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Open it.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Give me an egg.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
An egg.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
An egg.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it me?

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's an egg in here.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you want me to take it out?

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It would be nice if you brought it.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is one enough?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
One is enough.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hold it.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My partner.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's coming out.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Cut the egg.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you have a knife?

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll do it for you.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What size should I cut it into?

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
About two fourths.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Half.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Huh?

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Two fourths.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Half and half?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You guys aren't doing anything.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You guys are just messing around.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's good.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sakamoto-san, this isn't right.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It doesn't fit in here.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It doesn't fit in here.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You shouldn't have said that.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm losing my energy.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm losing my energy.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What is that?

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What is that?

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What is that?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What is that?

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It can't be helped.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It can't be helped.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's everyone's service today.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yamazaki, did you mix it?

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you mix it?

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is that?

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's written on it?

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's something over there.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's something over there.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is Itamon's wine.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is Itamon's wine.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What?

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a strong wine.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a strong wine.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is that so?

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is that so?

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Is that so?

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is it.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's the vinegar of the grape.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's the vinegar of the grape.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's vinegar.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's vinegar.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Vinegar.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
E.S.T.R.A.M.O.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
E.S.T.R.A.M.O.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, the smell of meat is gone.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes, yes.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's how you put the wine.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The smell of meat.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Boil it properly.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you talking about?

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, he's back.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He's back.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's not coming back.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's not coming back?

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He's back, he's back.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Scary!

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Ta-da!

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Eat it.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Eat it.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It took a long time.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Eat it, eat it.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What kind of food is this?

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is...

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sakamoto D Omelette.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sakamoto D Omelette is tasteless.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
See you next week.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's have a good lunch.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This time, it's not going to be like this.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That was scary.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's been a long time.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Right?

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, well.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's the first time this year.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you know why the monitor is showing?

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, really? Why is it showing?

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's not usual.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not scary.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The amazing thing is...

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The people who are watching you on TV...

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They say you're amazing.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't do that.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There are a lot of people like that these days.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait a minute.

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm praising you.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm saying you're amazing.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Someone else is coming.

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What do you mean?

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You've been called a big brother before.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's not true.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm just a kid.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What? What?

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Last year, you spoke in a talk show.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was perfect.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I...

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, yes, yes.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What is it all of a sudden?

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, I'll watch it.

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've answered a lot of other questions in this talk show.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why are you suddenly feeling better?

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, no, no.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What is it?

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's take a look.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's right.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This way.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's right.

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let me tell you something.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Stop being angry.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you talking about?

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who would be happy with that?

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you were happy with that, you were still eating cup noodles.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In the 1950s.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The air is over.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
After the air is over, we're going to talk about today's event.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Part of the pedestrian heaven in Harajuku, Tokyo.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Due to the noise and traffic jam of the rock band.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
From today, it will be disbanded.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
A year ago.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You predicted a lack of glasses.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How did it turn out?

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What else is going to happen this year?

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The Earth.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a huge planet.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
A very, very big planet.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to go up.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Around Australia on Earth.

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This program was brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
10 items of it, a rare item that can be seen as a meteorite.

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This.

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is the Udo of the employee who was watching the air.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Amazing.

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I didn't get told that he was amazing.

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But he was watching this.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Amazing.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's what he said.

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How many years have you been doing this program?

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
4 or 5 years?

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
7 years.

240
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
7 years?

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You've been doing it for 7 years.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not just this.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I didn't get to say it, but there's a lot more.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What is there?

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There's really a lot more.

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There's really a lot more.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Say that.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There are only two now.

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What is it?

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What did you say?

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Tell me what you guessed.

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's why I said there's a lot more.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's why I said there's a lot more.

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's why I said there's a lot more.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What is it, Kinpatsu-san?

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There's 20 to 30.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This is bad.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, no, no.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Just say one.

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But it's really amazing.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Regarding the meteorite, this is a prophecy, right?

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's a prophecy?

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a divine thing.

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Regarding the meteorite.

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Regarding the prophecy,

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the flow of the world, or rather, what everyone is thinking,

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
all of it, how do I say this,

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
with all the antennas hanging around,

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
all of it, the flow of the world is being read.

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't get it.

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The flow of the world is being read.

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I see.

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I also knew that Murayama-san would quit.

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, I heard it on the phone.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Wait.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's light.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, that's how it is.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm looking forward to this year.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm looking forward to this year.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Because I already knew that you were going to be in Kouhaku last year.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Last year?

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's right.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Last year, I didn't say it yet.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's right.

285
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I said it in March.

286
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's right.

287
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why did I say I was going to be in Kouhaku in January?

288
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I already knew that.

289
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My voice is getting smaller.

290
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why have you been looking at my nipples since this year?

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You bully me.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, it's fine.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You...

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What?

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The story is a bit old-fashioned, but...

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
When you looked at my face,

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
you had a really funny face.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Right?

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Right?

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I said it, but it was a bit high.

302
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It wasn't high?

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
When I was in Kouhaku, it wasn't high.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It was a bit high.

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You...

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
My staff said that you were high.

307
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why wasn't I high?

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why weren't you high?

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's because I was high on stage.

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, no, no.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You weren't high.

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, it was like this.

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
My face was like this.

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
First of all, when everyone was going like this, you were going up like this.

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You were going up like this.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
At that time, I went down like this.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I found Hamada like this.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I didn't know Hamada yet.

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
When I was going like this,

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you had a really happy face.

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A real entertainer is a person whose teeth are life.

322
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Right?

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It was like Miki Sakugawa.

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I said Saki-chan.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You didn't say it.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well...

327
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll start.

328
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The one who eats sardines.

329
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I know, I know.

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
After I was introduced to you.

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The Kitajima Family.

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It seems that they gather once a year as a family and have a banquet.

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They eat sardines and drink alcohol.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What do they do after that?

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mr. Matsumoto of the Kitajima Family, please tell me.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm also a family member.

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No, no, no.

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I've been in the family for a long time.

339
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Who is the one at the top?

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Who is the one under Mr. Kitajima?

341
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The eldest son is George.

342
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Ah, George Yamamoto.

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I understand.

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What's next?

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The one under George is...

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Matsubara Nobue.

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You know it, don't you?

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's right. That's exactly right.

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I mean, you know it, don't you?

350
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm a family member.

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What are you?

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm under Matsubara Nobue.

353
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He's really loved by everyone.

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He's a scoundrel.

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I've always been under Matsubara Nobue.

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're lying.

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm telling the truth.

358
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You've always been under Matsubara Nobue.

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's right. I've always been under Matsubara Nobue.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's a nice New Year's Eve, George.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Ah, you've fallen in love with George.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You were like this at that time.

363
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I've always been like this.

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't lie to me.

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I've always been following him around.

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What do you eat?

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I eat Katsunoko.

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ah, George. It's a nice New Year's Eve, George.

369
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm definitely not a scoundrel.

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm also under the age of my father.

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Under the age of your father?

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
From my father.

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How old are you?

374
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm like a family member.

375
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

376
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What?

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't understand.

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you do karaoke?

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't do karaoke.

380
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Ah, I see. You don't do karaoke.

381
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have an annual event every year.

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Ah, I see.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I write a lot of events.

384
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
From what time to what time.

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you have a schedule?

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, I do.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I've already eaten.

388
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I've already eaten.

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I've already drank.

390
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I've already drank.

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What time is that?

392
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
About noon?

393
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's about 6 o'clock in the evening.

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What time do you do it?

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
About 7 in the morning.

396
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's enough!

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's go home!

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
From 6 o'clock in the evening...

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I start drawing flowers.

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wait a minute.

401
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Drawing flowers?

402
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Drawing flowers?

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well then, let's do it, George.

404
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's do it.

405
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's do it.

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What do you have prepared?

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have thick brushes.

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I have thick brushes.

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I have thick brushes.

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have thick brushes.

411
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I have thick brushes.

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I have thick brushes.

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I have thick brushes.

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I have thick brushes.

415
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Huh?

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You're not going to lose, George!

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
A draw card!

418
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I've eaten.

419
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm going crazy at this point.

420
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Get out of the way!

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What's with you?

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They told me to get out of my way from the ramen.

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to have a cup of rice this year.

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When that's over.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
When that's over, you'll be a threat again.

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Two times?

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Two times.

428
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You guys are pretty funny.

429
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't do anything!

430
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're the funny one!

431
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
When I can't get along with my boss, I don't have the courage to fight or stop the time.

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Please tell us in detail about the incident when Matsumoto-san quit after a big fight with a salaryman.

433
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, yes, yes.

434
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Did you do it?

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I worked as a salaryman for about four years.

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I got promoted pretty fast.

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What do you mean, promoted?

438
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I got promoted fast.

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You were promoted, right?

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I was promoted.

441
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Really?

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What did you do when you quit?

444
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I was a manager.

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What do you mean, a manager?

446
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You've been a manager for four years?

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I forgot.

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I was a new manager.

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Manager...

450
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Manager's secretary?

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Not secretary.

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Manager Kokoroe?

453
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Kokoroe! Kokoroe!

454
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You called me Kokoroe!

455
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What is that?

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was called Manager Kokoroe.

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is that?

458
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What is Manager Kokoroe?

459
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What company was that?

460
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Interior.

461
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A company that makes lighting equipment.

462
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What were you doing there?

463
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

464
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
A company that makes lighting equipment.

465
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Presentation.

466
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What?

467
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Presentation.

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What's a presentation?

469
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's a presentation.

470
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You went to a pretty good place. Why?

471
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, this time, I had a lot of...

472
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I had a business trip overseas.

473
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I see.

474
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I had a fight.

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
With the Arabs.

476
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
With the Arabs?

477
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I had a fight with the Arab manager.

478
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The Arab manager kept pushing me.

479
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I was really angry.

480
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You didn't quit?

481
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No.

482
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If I do this again tomorrow, Yutaro will...

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, at least for a day.

484
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
At least for a day.

485
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't know if it was my imagination.

486
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't know if it was my imagination.

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know if it was my imagination.

488
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's funny.

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The story behind the necktie.

490
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The story behind the necktie.

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Tell us three things you've gained from having your necktie under your belt.

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Of course there are three.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The first thing.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
First of all, when you go to a butcher shop, even if you say 300g, they usually put in 400g.

495
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
Eh? Eh? Put it in?

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes, put it in.

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You say, is it okay?

498
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
It's funny.

499
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's the funniest.

500
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You say, is it okay?

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You say, is it okay?

502
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You say, please give me 300g of this part.

503
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes, Mr. Inga.

504
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You say, is it okay to put in 300g?

505
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When you go home, they usually put in 400g.

506
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, they also take 400g of money.

507
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What is that?

508
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Toku-chan!

509
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Well, there's a lot of other things.

510
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
After that, there's that thing, right?

511
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's that thing where you can hug a woman as much as you want.

512
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why?

513
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
First of all, if you're seen by me...

514
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you're seen by me?!

515
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What kind of guy are you trying to hug?

516
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you going to the hospital?

517
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If you're seen by me...

518
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If I look at you...

519
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
If you look at me and say, I like you, I can definitely do it.

520
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is the power of the tie.

521
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I wonder why that happens.

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't know why.

523
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't know why you put it in.

524
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I didn't put it in today.

525
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I didn't put it in today, so I don't have any strength.

526
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If you put it in, most of them will be like this.

527
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What?

528
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
In sports, your muscles are more activated than usual.

529
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's why.

530
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You get the power you don't usually get.

531
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What do you mean?

532
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
For example, I usually run at 50 meters in 6.5 seconds.

533
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Usually.

534
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Depending on whether you put on a tie or not, it's about 4 seconds.

535
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Even now?

536
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If you put in a tie, your feet won't move, right?

538
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
My feet move fast.

539
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If you put it in a tie.

540
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What do you want me to do?

541
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's okay.

542
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's okay, but when you're running, you have to take it off.

543
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
All at once.

544
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

545
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's going to be a mess.

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, no.

547
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, no.
