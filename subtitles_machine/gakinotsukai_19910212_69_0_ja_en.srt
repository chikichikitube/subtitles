1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No, really

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
No, no, no

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, I think more than half of you have noticed

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hamada-kun is off today

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It can't be helped

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, I know that

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Since yesterday, the wind has gotten worse

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It can't be helped

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's not like I'm taking a break for him

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll do it alone today

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I thought I'd get more booing

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But it wasn't like that

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Today's good friend was amazing

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's so annoying

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And he's off

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Really

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's hard to do it alone

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I have an opportunity to see Hamada-kun today

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm shooting a VTR

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's watch it together

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've been saying this for 3 or 4 weeks

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I did a baseball tournament

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I want you to see the results and the atmosphere of the game

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Good luck

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We divided into the Towns team

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We played 5 games in total

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The result of the game was that one of us had to be punished by 9 people

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You'll see the results today

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I haven't told you the results yet

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you see this, you'll know that Hamada-kun has a black stomach

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's watch it together

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Chikitsuki All-Star Dream Q&A

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's go

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The teams that won each game are all here

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Downs

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
5 games

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No goal

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No goal

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No goal

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No goal

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No goal

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There are a lot of people who are not good at shooting

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But you're good

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't see the goal from there

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's dangerous to look at it in a different way

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I finally got a bandage off my head

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's a punishment game

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you lose, we have a terrible punishment game

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I won't say it here

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's do our best

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's start the game

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's do it

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's do it

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's do it

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's start the All-Star Dream Q&A

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Matsumoto Toshu threw a big ball

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a drive

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hamada is the second batter

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a catch

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hamada is the second batter

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo is the next batter

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a high shot

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But it's a batter

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hamada is the second batter

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a home in like a ninja

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I didn't remember that

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This time, the Town's attack continues

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How will the Down's team fight?

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The first batter is Kobayashi

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hamada's fast ball

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hamada throws five balls

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Matsumoto Toshu's cool expression

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The second ball is Matsumoto

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a third ball

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But it's a batter

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Will they win?

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Matsumoto Toshu is the second batter

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a home in like a ninja

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a home in like a ninja

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's a home in like a ninja

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a home in like a ninja

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The first batter is Noriyasu

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a home in like a ninja

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Tsuga is the second batter

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Noriyasu throws five balls

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The Down's team is in the lead

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a home in like a ninja

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's a home in like a ninja

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a home in like a ninja

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The third batter is Hamada

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a home in like a ninja

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's a home in like a ninja

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Next, Ikeagaru Matsumoto.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He shoots!

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He's so careful, he's a Naira-frider.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But, this time, it's a last play for the producer, who's a genius.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He's not even aware of his position.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Next, Occhan Kawano.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a third goal.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He's going to score a third parry.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's going to score a goal again.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Matsumoto's team is in the lead.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a 4-1.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sakamoto is in the lead.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's going left, left, left.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And the runner is in the lead.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The left-hander is in the lead.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The team's mode is on.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's a tense game with a two-point return with an explosion at the end of the first quarter.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, is it a counterattack of the Hamada team on the 4th floor?

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The runner who came out in the middle of the error was hit by the batter Onkomuro.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a left-over hit.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Left Tsuchiya, whose legs are wrinkled.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The runner is a home in. The fifth run of the Hamada team.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Matsumoto, who is anxious about the second half.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The Hamada team is alive.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The batter is also a right-handed hitter.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And the batter, Takasu, is also a center over.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This time, the Hamada team beats Noriasu, who is in the middle of the error.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The batter, Ichiyun, is leading by 7 to 3 with 3 points.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And the 5th run of the Kaihatsu team.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The Hamada team's attack on the strange batter, Matsumoto, has not stopped.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's a home run of the camera Sakanishi.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a home run of Dameushi.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The camera Sakanishi is in a relaxed pose.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a 3 to 9 home in.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The next batter, Takasu, is also a counterattack of the Hamada team.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a home run.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a home run.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Really?

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a home run.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a home run.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a ball run.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a ball run.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a home run.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's a home run.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a home run.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a home run.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a home run.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why did you hit the ball?

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And finally, the final 11 to 3.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Will the 8 points difference be able to return to the team?

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The 5th run of the Hamada team, the battle batter, Hashin.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're not impressed, are you?

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're not impressed, are you?

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you laughing at?

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a home run.

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, Matsuyama, Shiratsuki, Hajime, and Jigoku batters are also out due to the dangerous play of the 2nd baseman.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And the last batter, Sugata, also has a three-point game set.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I lost.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is that?

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What is that?

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
11 to 3.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Time's up.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
11 to 3.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The Towns won.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
As promised, it's a penalty game.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The Towns.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The whole team.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The 10 of us.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Takatsu.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's how it is.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm going to say this now.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Takatsu hit it.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't know if it was a home run.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No, no, no.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was completely a home run.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It was totally...

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It was completely...

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I knew it was a home run.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And that's it.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's it for the baseball game.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Matsuyama, Shiratsuki, Hajime, and Jigoku batters.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The penalty game is yours.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But the game is not a result.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't say anything about losing.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Your hard work, determination, and sweat.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's more wonderful than winning.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, Towns.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The Hall of Fame doesn't shine on you.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's it.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I lost.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The penalty game is coming soon.

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'd like you to watch it.

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My team.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Team Zero.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Where?

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
These guys.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
These guys.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They said it was a high school baseball game.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, no.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What are you doing?

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, it's not.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I was disappointed before the game.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Matsumoto's long-distance practice.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why?

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Matsumoto was so good.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He was a good hitter.

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He ran like this.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Like a mother.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Like a baby.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The director.

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm disappointed.

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not good at running.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I'm fast.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you fast?

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I've caught the tail of a running cheater.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was surprised.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Actually, I want to complain.

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Noriyasu was injured.

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I was hiding it.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I had a fracture in my ribs.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I had a fracture in my ribs.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's a good part.

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I had a fracture in my ribs.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I had a fracture in my ribs.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's call the winning team.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What?

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Talk to me.

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't talk much.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Are you from the Philippines?

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is the winning team.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This guy.

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This guy.

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He played a lot of Asian games.

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I was surprised.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I caught the liner.

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You were doing it in practice.

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I caught the liner.

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I saw it.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I heard it from the person who caught the liner.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I heard it from the person who caught the liner.

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why did you win?

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I was strong.

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You didn't lose.

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I didn't have a good shot.

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My shot was faster than I thought.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You thought.

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
My shot was faster than I thought.

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You thought.

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I thought you were strong.

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I thought you were strong.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
My shot was faster than I thought.

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was doing my best.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was unlucky.

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will play a penalty game.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will never play baseball again.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will never play baseball again.

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What are you going to do?

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will play soccer.

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's bad.

262
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You will play in this team.

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you going to do?

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You will play in this team.

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Soccer.

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You will play in the down team.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You will do it.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You will do it.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's right.

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't hit me.

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's already decided.

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's already decided.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You are a silver-field killer.

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I will do it.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's do it in another sport.

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's do it in another sport.

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's do it in another sport.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I want to do something other than baseball.

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Thank you.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What did you say?

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't think I can win.

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Everyone in my team runs fast.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How fast are you?

285
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm 6.6 meters.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you doing?

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I rarely appear on TV.

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm getting better.

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm 6.6 meters.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm 7 seconds flat.

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm 7 seconds flat.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You are fast.

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm 2.9 seconds flat.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I will write a letter.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I will write a letter.

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Please bring a letter.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hello.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is a man in the team.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There is a man in the team.

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I will introduce him.

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
His name is Asako Imachi.

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
When she played baseball, she got a scoreboard.

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A scoreboard?

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I have a scorebook.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Is your boyfriend here?

306
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No.

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No?

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Who will you choose?

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will choose you.

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will choose you.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No.

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No.

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Everyone knows it.

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you put me in the team, people will say that we are the same age.

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What should I do?

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I will get a scoreboard tomorrow.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you very much.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Goodbye.

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We always do it together.

321
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Today, we will say whatever we want to say.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I will do whatever I want to do.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I am excited.

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This person is angry.

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is a girl who is 15 years old.

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I am Matsumoto.

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't bully Otomo.

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am a girl who likes Matsumoto.

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But I like Otomo more than Matsumoto.

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Matsumoto, please let Otomo play with a girl.

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Otomo is amazing.

332
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I saw his letter.

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There were about 10 letters.

334
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Otomo is good.

335
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Otomo, do you have a girlfriend?

336
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If she is my friend, I will do it with her.

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

339
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't like it.

340
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Good evening, Matsumoto.

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I always enjoy watching your show.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Actually, I was watching your show on January 30th.

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was watching the draft meeting with my girlfriend.

344
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I decided to write a letter.

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He wrote to Hama-chan.

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She is a big fan of Matsumoto.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
While we were talking to each other,

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I wrote a letter with a diamond.

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hama-chan, please help me.

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Matsumoto, I will definitely ask you for a diamond.

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I wrote this letter while watching the TV.

352
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Diamond.

353
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Women say it easily these days.

354
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Change the diamond.

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Have you ever bought something expensive?

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I bought a silver ring.

357
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
For your girlfriend?

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes.

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How much was it?

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, it was 10,000 yen.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
10,000 yen?

362
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I bought a silver ring for her.

363
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But when I met her a year later,

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
it became a gold ring.

365
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The next man bought it.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes.

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Matsumoto, what kind of ring do you give her?

368
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Something expensive.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Really expensive.

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, for me...

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, if it's something expensive,

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I give her a Rolex.

373
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What kind of ring do you give her now?

374
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you give her such an expensive thing?

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Isn't it a pair watch ring?

376
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Isn't it?

377
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think it's a Rolex.

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think it's a Rolex.

379
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What?

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Look!

381
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a Rolex!

382
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm wearing a Rolex,

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
so what's the big deal?

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a Rolex!

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You probably don't know Team Zero,

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
but it's better not to get involved with them.

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Both of them are crazy.

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The other day,

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I went to a cafe in Roppongi.

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There's a cafe cappuccino.

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Look, there's a piece of dough.

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You mix it with a spoon.

393
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
As soon as it's done,

394
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
this guy says,

395
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm so lucky.

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I got some sweets.

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This guy says,

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Really?

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Really?

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What do I do with this?

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You mix it,

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you mix it with this,

403
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and you eat it.

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I went to Disneyland with him before.

405
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He was having so much fun,

406
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because he was an idiot.

407
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He was like,

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Peter Pan!

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is a story

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
about a friend who had an accident.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
His friend was riding a bike,

412
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and he was about to pass next to the car.

413
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Suddenly, the door of the car opened,

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and his friend fell down

415
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
as if he were being pushed by the door.

416
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The first thing the woman said

417
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
when she got in the car was,

418
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I did it!

419
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I saw it!

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
She didn't even apologize.

421
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
When her friend came to her head

422
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and asked her for her name,

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
she said,

424
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm Taihei, nice to meet you.

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She said she went somewhere.

426
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Have you ever had an accident like this?

427
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You've had an accident in your car, haven't you?

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It wasn't a truck.

429
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was a six-ton truck.

430
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
A six-ton truck

431
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
was riding on your leg!

432
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What happened?

433
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I got off the bus,

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and I thought I'd go to the side

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and hit the order board.

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Then, the truck tried to overtake the bus,

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and it got out of the bus.

438
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What?

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What?

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It got out of the bus?

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What do you mean

442
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the moment it got out of the bus?

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The bus stopped,

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and the truck tried to overtake it,

445
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and it tried to get in front of the bus,

446
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and it got out of the bus.

447
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, I see.

448
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The six-ton truck was riding on your leg.

449
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It was just for a moment.

450
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Did you get hurt?

451
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It hurt.

452
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It doesn't hurt at all!

453
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So, today,

454
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'd like to end it here.

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But since Hamada-kun isn't here,

456
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
it can't be helped.

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's end it here for today.

458
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What?

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Sappu?

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Sappu,

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
you can't get along with him anymore.

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Someone said,

463
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
you can't get along with him anymore.

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
There's no one who can get along with him.

465
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's important to get along with him

466
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
when he's stupid.

467
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Do it again.

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I can't get along with him even if I do it again.

469
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I can't get along with Sappu anymore.

470
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You idiot!

471
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Today's musical instrument was amazing.

472
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's been a year and a half.

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's been a long time since I've been this sweaty.

474
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I can't believe that everyone can't talk this much.

475
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well, that's fine.

476
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Next week,

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
a wonderful punishment game will be delivered to everyone.

478
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Please look forward to it.

479
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What else?

480
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm looking for a talent like Mr. Ishii.

481
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm looking for an assistant.

482
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm looking forward to writing a fun story

483
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
that can be spread even in the city.

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm looking forward to it.

485
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Next week,

486
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hamada-kun will definitely come.

487
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm looking forward to it.

488
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
When Hamada-kun comes,

489
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I want to take a break once.

490
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm looking forward to it like this.

491
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's all for today.

492
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm not a playwright.

493
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
See you next week.

494
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Goodbye.

495
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not a playwright.
