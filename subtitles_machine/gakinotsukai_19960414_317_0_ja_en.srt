1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today, we're here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's like we're being called.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're being called here.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hotel Charum.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's Hotel Charum.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're supposed to wait here at the parking lot.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is that so?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't know.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is a love hotel, right?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a love hotel.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's also an air-conditioner.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we wait here...

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is there something fun?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today's star is going to appear.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Why are we being called?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well...

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sure you're confident.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Is that so?

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think you can guess who it is.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're on this show, but you're being called.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anyway, at the love hotel parking lot,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we were told to wait.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's a car coming in.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There's a car coming in.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Good morning.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good morning.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is this guy being called?

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Good morning.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good morning.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is this guy being called?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, this guy.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's not me.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Good morning.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Listen to me.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What is it?

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today's opening.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I came up with it.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please use it.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is it a project to attract people?

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a project to attract people.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Please use it.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I thought about it.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm in my 30s.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm in my 30s.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're not in your 30s.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not in my 30s.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm in my 30s.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're in your 30s.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to be an old man.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to be an old man.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If I think about it,

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I can't get out of downtown.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I see.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Even if I continue to be a celebrity,

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can go to a good place like downtown.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's great.

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But I can't get out.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I see.

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll give you a character.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A character?

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is it?

63
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Super dirty.

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is there anyone who sells that?

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've heard that kind of legend.

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is that so?

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Super dirty.

68
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's just a legend.

69
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But it's a little thing.

70
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can't be super dirty.

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right.

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right.

73
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't be crazy.

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

75
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What?

76
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Dori.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Dori.

78
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, this guy.

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm serious.

80
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Can you sell that?

81
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to do something special today.

82
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm looking forward to it.

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Show me your partner.

84
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My partner?

85
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's in the car right now.

86
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I came with him.

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What is it?

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yamada-san.

89
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a surprise.

90
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to do this today.

91
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's cute.

92
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's cute.

93
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yamada-san.

94
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

95
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want you to see this.

96
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm in a hotel room right now.

99
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm wondering if I can really see the legendary super dirty.

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is all private.

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

103
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go, Sumire-chan.

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't like this room.

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's big.

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Look at this.

107
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's called Sumire-chan.

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's a cute name.

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's sit down.

110
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come here.

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Look at this.

113
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Really?

114
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know.

115
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's still early.

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wait a minute.

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's still early.

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sumire-chan.

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is this picture?

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What do you like about Sumire-chan?

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Look at this.

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't stand it anymore.

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sumire-chan, I can't stand it.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I want to go out with you.

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't put a video of you dating.

126
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I want to go out with you.

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
what?

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What are you doing?

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Stop it.

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Look at this.

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Look at this.

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Look at this.

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sumire-chan.

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look at this.

135
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please forgive us.

136
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Dad and mom.

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you want to buy something?

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sumire-chan.

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you want to buy something?

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's wrong with you, Sumire-chan?

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Show me your bag.

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What is this?

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Show me your bag.

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I like you.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come here.

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What is this?

147
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What's wrong with you?

148
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't you like me?

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Show me your bag.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why are you here?

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why are you here?

152
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You know that, don't you?

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You don't like me, do you?

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't like you.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm going to take a shower.

156
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wait a minute.

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll be right back.

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It felt good.

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Did you take a shower?

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Come here.

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ouch.

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What are you doing now?

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing?

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you doing?

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't do that.

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You scratched me.

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You look like this.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Did you take a shower?

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's take a picture of Sumire-chan.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You are cute.

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Look at me.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I like the way you tie your ribbon.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Take a picture of me.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Take a picture of me.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Take a picture of me.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Take a picture of me.

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take a picture of me.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Take a picture of me.

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why are you so angry?

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why are you so angry?

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How is Sumire-chan?

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Did Sumire-chan take a shower?

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sumire-chan, don't do that.

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sumire-chan, don't do that.

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't break your promise.

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sumire-chan, don't do that.

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are so mean.

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Come here.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come here.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You are so mean.

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What did you say?

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are so mean.

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are funny.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you tired?

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Drink something.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm not tired.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Really?

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I thought you were tired.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you talking about?

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not tired.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sumire-chan is acting like a fool.

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He is acting like a fool.

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are acting like a fool.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You are acting like a fool.

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's not true.

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's hard to act in a drama.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
From the third time, it's 38%.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's not true.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I went to the filming site.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The atmosphere is different from variety shows.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's not true.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you so quiet?

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Especially before the show.

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't do that.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Really?

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I experienced it for the first time.

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Is that so?

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did something happen?

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Dreams are strange.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Why do people dream?

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It has nothing to do with dreams.

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
People dream even if they don't think about it.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
People dream even if they don't think about it.

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Recently, I dreamed of Miyazawa Rie.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
With Rie-mama.

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
In my dream, Rie-mama and I were in the corridor.

231
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was angry.

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I fell in love with Rie-mama.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why do people dream?

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I used to be like that.

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I dreamed of Yashiro Aki.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I fell in love with Rie-mama.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I feel good.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
When I wake up, I feel empty.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Sometimes I fall in love with Rie-mama.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I used to be like this.

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I used to be like this.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I used to be like this.

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is that true?

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In winter, I used to kick the stove.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's true.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I dreamed of a taxi driver.

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I used to fight with a taxi driver.

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's true.

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I dreamed of a taxi driver.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I used to kick the stove.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I used to kick the stove.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
At that time, I was walking on the cliff.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I fell in love with Rie-mama.

256
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I used to be like this.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Now you live in a big house.

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's true.

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What is this?

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know yet.

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know either.

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's really strange.

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't write it.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well.

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What do you think?

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There is no such thing.

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There is no such thing.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There is no such thing.

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There is no such thing.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There is no such thing.

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What is it?

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What is it?

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please show me the picture.

275
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes.

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't say anything.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Time is running out.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has travelled around the world twice.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In Japanese toilets there are only Japanese-style toilets.

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are there only these two toilets around the world?

282
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No such thing.

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They exist.

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What is that?

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What kind of toilet is it?

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There are many types of toilets.

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can see various cultures.

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't say such boring things.

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Where was it?

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Was it when I went to New Zealand?

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's kind of easy, isn't it?

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I went deeper into New Zealand.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Where did you go deeper into?

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I went up to the 23rd floor.

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay!

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I went into a fairly secluded area of New Zealand.

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The 23rd floor?

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes, I went there.

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That was amazing.

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think it was right in the middle.

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, I see.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The area between the Japanese and Western countries.

303
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What was it like? Were there people playing with each other?

304
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, this side was like this, and this side was like this.

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It was like this.

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Isn't that a picture of me standing on my knees?

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What is this?

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If you're going to do this, then stand up!

309
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Also, if you went deeper, there was something like this.

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Ah!

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sticky, sticky, sticky!

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sticky!

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, there were a lot of things like that.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There are a lot of things like that in the world.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm not a old man!

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not an old man.

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So you mean that the toilet was here?

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right.

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There were only holes in the toilet.

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What do you mean by holes?

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There were only holes for poop.

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So, there were holes for poop, and there were holes for ass, like this.

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Like this, like this, like this.

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I've never done that.

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There were countries like that, too.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I've been to a lot of places.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Really?

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What surprised you the most?

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That surprised me.

331
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Where?

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't know if you said that.

333
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I was surprised all the time.

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, really?

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's a lot, isn't it?

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was a lot.

337
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:14,000
My face was surprised all the time.

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why are you like this?

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What kind of face is that?

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What kind of face is that?

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You can't make that face.

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was surprised.

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Where?

344
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That was in Riviera.

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You remembered the song.

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's Riviera, right?

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Where is Riviera?

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Riviera is not directly from Japan.

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Then where is it?

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's outside.

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So, where is it outside?

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What is it?

353
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What shape was it?

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What shape?

355
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What do you mean?

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's the most important thing.

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why do I have to tell you such a thing?

358
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's the opposite.

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's the opposite.

360
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You've been like this all the time.

361
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then let me tell you.

362
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What I saw and heard,

363
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I have to tell you everything?

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I have my own precious memories.

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
My precious memories.

366
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
A postcard.

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why do I have to tell you?

368
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I have a wooden sword.

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Say sorry.

370
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What?

371
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What?

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can't tell me what it is.

373
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was surprised.

374
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's why I told you to say it.

375
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are you going to say that?

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Please tell me.

377
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry to say this.

378
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Please tell me.

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The toilet is small.

380
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's very small.

381
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The toilet is like this.

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's the shape of the toilet.

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's a toilet with a gold cover.

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is it Japanese style?

385
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's Japanese style.

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's Japanese style, but it's this small.

387
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
When I opened the toilet, there were about 20 of them.

388
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Riviera is amazing.

389
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Riviera is amazing.

390
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's coming out little by little.

391
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's right.

392
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's coming out little by little.

393
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If it goes all the way, it won't be washed away.

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I see.

395
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There's also time.

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is there time?

397
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There is time.

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's like a game.

399
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The end.

400
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Who said that?

401
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How to measure the time without a clock

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How can I measure the time without a clock when I make cup noodles?

403
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You can measure it for about 3 minutes.

404
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What?

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't have a clock.

406
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,500
Don't you know how to measure 3 minutes by yourself?

407
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't know how to measure it?

408
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Everyone needs to know how to measure 3 minutes.

409
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Is that so?

410
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
That's right.

411
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
What should I do?

412
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
What?

413
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
3 minutes...

414
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
That's scary!

415
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
For example, you can do anything, right?

416
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Yes.

417
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Hmm, let's see...

418
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Then...

419
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Let's do this.

420
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's do this.

421
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Right?

422
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
How many seconds is this?

423
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
I don't know.

424
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
There's no way I'd know.

425
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Please measure it.

426
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Can you hold your watch?

427
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Please measure it.

428
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I'll do it.

429
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I don't even know how to measure it!

430
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
How many seconds is this?

431
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
It's 3 seconds.

432
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
How many seconds?

433
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
If you do this 10 times...

434
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
That's enough!

435
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
That's enough!

436
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Don't say it!

437
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
10 times?

438
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Yes!

439
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I can't do it!

440
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I can't do it 10 times, but...

441
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
It's a simple story, right?

442
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
So, how many seconds is this?

443
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
I don't even know how to measure it!

444
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
That's not it.

445
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I...

446
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I...

447
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
If I knew that it was 3 seconds,

448
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I wouldn't be in any trouble at any time.

449
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You just need to move it until it's 3 minutes.

450
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I just need to move it.

451
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
It doesn't have to be this, right?

452
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
It can be that.

453
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
This is fine, too.

454
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
This is fine, too.

455
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
How many seconds is this?

456
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I don't know!

457
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Measure it!

458
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
I can't do it!

459
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Measure it!

460
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
That's right.

461
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Okay, let's go.

462
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm so stupid.

463
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
How many seconds is this?

464
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
4 seconds.

465
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
4 seconds.

466
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
That means you just need to do this 80 times.

467
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
4 seconds...

468
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
This is 60 seconds, so I'm in trouble.

469
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't want to be asked the first question.

470
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'll get hurt.

471
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Then, please watch the next one.

472
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Yes, yes.

473
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I get hurt dozens of times a day because my intestines are different from others.

474
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Right?

475
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,500
If I get hurt in the elevator, what should I do to trick them?

476
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
It's a matter of sense of value.

477
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Sense of value?

478
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
It's a matter of sense of value.

479
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Don't you think it's embarrassing to get hurt in the elevator?

480
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I see.

481
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I'll make a normal face.

482
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
I won't close my butt.

483
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I'll get hurt, so I can't help it.

484
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I'll just go straight to the elevator.

485
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I'll go straight to the elevator.

486
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I'll make a normal face.

487
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Why don't you get hurt?

488
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I'm scared.

489
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Why don't you get hurt?

490
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I have a question for you.

491
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
The last question.

492
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
When does a chick become a chicken?

493
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
When does it start crying?

494
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Please tell me.

495
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
14 years old.

496
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
14 years old?

497
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
From a girl.

498
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I see.

499
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
When does a chick become a chicken?

500
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,500
I've never seen a chick become a chicken.

501
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
I've never seen a chick become a chicken.

502
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
It was a chick on Wednesday, but it became a chicken on Thursday.

503
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I've never seen a chick become a chicken.

504
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
That's not true.

505
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
There are times when a chick becomes a chicken.

506
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
One thing I can say is that it's an earthquake.

507
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
An earthquake.

508
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,500
For example, when you're not confident, your voice gets smaller.

509
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I don't know. I didn't notice that.

510
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
If you say that, I'll end the conversation.

511
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:38,500
For example, if you know a difficult question, you can answer it with a loud voice.

512
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
That's true for everyone.

513
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
That's true for everyone.

514
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
But if you're asked a question you're not confident in, you're like...

515
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I see.

516
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
That's what happens.

517
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
I see.

518
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,500
In the end, the chick says it's an earthquake.

519
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Are you nervous?

520
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm not confident.

521
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I have a strong feeling that it's something like me.

522
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It still looks like that.

523
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
That's right.

524
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Right?

525
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I respect chickens.

526
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
When you're older...

527
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
When you're about 20, you can't say that because you're older.

528
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I can't say that.

529
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
I understand.

530
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I understand.

531
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
That's why the chick says it, but it's...

532
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
It's like, huh?

533
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
It's like, huh?

534
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
It's like, huh?

535
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
It's like, huh?

536
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
It's like, huh?

537
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
It's like, huh?

538
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
It's like, huh?

539
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
But it's a big change.

540
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
What change?

541
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
It's the same as being a talent.

542
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
When you debut, you become obsessed with it.

543
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Among the big talents...

544
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Among the big chickens...

545
00:21:49,500 --> 00:22:08,920
Among all those chick

546
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
One chick...

547
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
That's the worst.

548
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I can't talk about it.

549
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
I can't talk about it.

550
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I can't speak about it.

551
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
That's right.

552
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
That's right.

553
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
From now on, there are chickens on TV.

554
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I understand.

555
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I don't think I can speak.

556
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I don't think I can speak.

557
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I don't think I can speak.

558
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
I don't think it's something like me saying that, do you?

559
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
That's how I feel.

560
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
What do you mean by that?

561
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
That's the only thing I can say.

562
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Let's just say it for now.

563
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
But you can't say it out loud, right?

564
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
So if you have a chick at home,

565
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
I'll ask you slowly.

566
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Put it on like this.

567
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Put the pin mic on the chick.

568
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Make it yellow.

569
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Make it yellow.

570
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Make it match the clothes.

571
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
If you put it on, it'll say,

572
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Kogeko!

573
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Gradually, you'll gain self-confidence.

574
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
You'll grow up.

575
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll be the big brother.

576
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
You'll be the big brother.

577
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
You'll get a lot of regulars.

578
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
You'll get a lot of regulars.

579
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
You'll be able to talk to the people below you.

580
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
And you'll have a big group of people.

581
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
And when that happens,

582
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
gradually, until yesterday,

583
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
you'd say, Kogeko.

584
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I understand that.

585
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I'll act it out now.

586
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
But if you don't do it on time, you'll get in trouble.

587
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
I'll get in trouble.

588
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
With the big brother?

589
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll get in trouble.

590
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Even though I haven't even started wearing Tosaka yet,

591
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
he'll say,

592
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
in that scene,

593
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
you're a cocky cocky guy!

594
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
He'll say that, but...

595
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I can't do that.

596
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
He'll say that later,

597
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
and I'll be like,

598
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
what's going on?

599
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
He'll say that.

600
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
You've been through a lot.

601
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
The manager will be rambling.

602
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I'm sorry, I still don't get it.

603
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I can't do it.

604
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
If I get on top of the guitar,

605
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
everyone will be against me.

606
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
They'll be against you?

607
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
I can't say that.

608
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You can't say that?

609
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
The big brother won't say it.

610
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
He won't say it.

611
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
But if you really say it,

612
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
you'll get in trouble later.

613
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
I won't get in trouble.

614
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
What are you trying to say?

615
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I can't say it.

616
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I can't say it.

617
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Oh, I said it.

618
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
If you say it, I'll get angry.
