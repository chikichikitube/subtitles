1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good evening!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good evening!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we started with Dance Dance Dance!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Every week we have a lot of people participating.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And what kind of dance will they show us?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, so...

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
First, let's introduce the judges!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes!

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First, here!

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Next, Keisuke Sho!

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Wonderful!

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's wonderful?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Keisuke Sho, it's nice to meet you.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Nice to meet you too.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Do you know us?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes!

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm a fan.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you very much.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What do you think of our dance?

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's interesting.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you very much.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You don't look like a real person at all.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Next, we have Kishi Chieko-sensei!

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, hello!

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want you to look at us with professional eyes.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, I feel like I'm already in a dance.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're already dancing like a chicken.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you very much.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Lastly, we have JJ Jefferson-san!

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nice to meet you.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nice to meet you too.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Your Japanese is bad.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's bad.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you married?

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
With a Japanese woman?

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How is your relationship with a Japanese woman?

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's amazing.

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you very much.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you very much.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That was long.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please introduce yourself.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's your name?

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Fumio Fukaba.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How old are you?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm 75 years old.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
75 years old.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you go to the disco often?

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I go there 3 times a week.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's amazing.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Really?

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you really go there 3 times a week?

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, yes.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What's the name of the bar you go to?

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Circus.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Circus?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're so sexy!

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why are you hitting me?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's ask him.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
First, Mr. Sugi.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mr. Heisuke.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How was your dance?

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If I didn't have bad legs, it would have been better.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Really?

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can do anything.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can do anything?

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can't do it if I don't have bad legs.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Shio, you go there 3 times a week.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If it's me, I go there once a week.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You hate losing.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't like losing.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Next person, please.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Entry number 2, Chiki Chiki Hawaiian Sisters.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chiki Chiki Hawaiian Sisters

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you very much.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It was a wonderful performance.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Did you learn the dance right away?

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I learned it in 3 months.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You learned it in 3 months?

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Some people die before they learn the dance.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Was there anyone like that in the past?

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No, not until now.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There was someone like that.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Not until now?

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's ask the judges.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Heisuke.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When you shake your hands, you stop in the middle, right?

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, yes.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think it's better not to stop.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you go with that, your hips will be like this.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you talking about?

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you crazy?

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You!

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you crazy?

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
As expected, it's an interesting reaction.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I see.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is there a age limit?

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How old do you have to be before you can enter?

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not at all.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Not at all?

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you look at it, you're about 1 or 2 months older than your master.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're doing it, right?

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm doing it, right?

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm glad.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm looking forward to what Mr. Jefferson will say.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
How was it, Mr. Jefferson?

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Very, very wonderful.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know the Kura dance, right?

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In Hawaii.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It really feels like Hawaii.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It really feels like Hawaii.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It really feels like Hawaii.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He's such a foreigner.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I got it.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The last person.

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go!

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Entry number 3.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Fujiyama Geisha dancers.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Come on, let's dance.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's okay, it's okay.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Grandma, too.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How old are you?

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm 65 years old.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you look closely, you really look like you have Japanese characters on your face.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And the mother behind you.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm already 1 year old, and I'm 70 years old.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mom, do you eat gold powder?

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes!

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
For today.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I went to the dentist for today, but I didn't make it in time, so I was going to hide my age.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You talk too much about unnecessary things.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Shion!

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How is it?

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey!

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey, what are you doing?

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why did you stop me when I hit you?

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But really.

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're having fun, aren't you?

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm having fun, aren't I?

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Japan has become rich.

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What are you talking about?

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ms. Kishi, how is it?

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But you're pretty good at this kind of thing, aren't you?

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, yes.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The record I'm playing right now is a record I played when I was 16.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, really?

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Fujiyama Geisha came out, but it was flat, wasn't it?

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When I was dancing, I couldn't see my face, and the umbrella was reflected very well.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I see.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The one I like the most is...

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good, good.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I like it.

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I like that one.

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I like it.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you like it, please take one home.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Good, good.

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The best...

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, the best...

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right?

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's going to be an interesting key holder, isn't it?

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're mistaken.

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now, let's announce the winner from the ace final.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was Osomatsu.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, I didn't say that.

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't say anything.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I said it was Osomatsu.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, I...

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
After all, I'm good at hula dancing.

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hula dancing?

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's hula dancing, isn't it?

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This week's champion is number two, hula dancer.

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He won.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I have a championship tournament.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But the championship tournament is five years from now.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I wonder if everyone will be there.

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm really busy.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Busy.

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's a lot of work.

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Today, well...

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know what to say during this broadcast.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The lightning.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right, today.

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There was a lot of lightning.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It was like this.

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes, yes, yes.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's probably because the sky is angry.

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why is that?

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's because humans do things they don't need to do.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you mean by things you don't need to do?

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Like trying to fly into space with a rocket.

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What do you mean by things like that?

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What is it?

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
TBS is making a lot of money.

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, that's fine.

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Next year, well...

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I heard a little bit about my fortune.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Who?

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, on the show.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
On the show?

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The people who came.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I saw their fortune.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't have much luck next year.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you trust them?

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, I don't trust them very much.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't think next year will be good.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They say it won't be good.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They say it won't be good.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It won't be a big deal.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you talking about?

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It won't be a big deal.

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's why I don't think I'll be in the entertainment industry next year.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Already?

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No, no, really.

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Really?

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, really.

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Do you believe in fortune-telling?

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, not really.

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you believe in fortune-telling?

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
For example, what do you mean by fortune-telling?

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, like carrying a coin or something.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, not really.

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, the fortune-telling that used to be described as a normal punch is really annoying.

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't know why.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was so angry that I was about to blow up.

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Last week, you were like...

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You...

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes?

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You should have put it together first.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why are you trying to put it together after talking?

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's why last week you were like...

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know I'm tired, right?

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're always like that.

250
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're laughing because you're always laughing when you're angry.

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm a little...

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm a little old-fashioned.

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It doesn't matter.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It doesn't matter usually.

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I was reading the normal punch on the Shinkansen.

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Last week, did you have a secret?

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This week is bad.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Say it last week.

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm telling you to say it when it's dangerous.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Everyone goes to the Shinkansen for the first time.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And when the exam season starts, they go to get an amulet.

263
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They go.

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can't trust them as much as an amulet.

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The one who has it is a fool.

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There's someone hanging it on the car.

267
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There are quite a few.

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's a fool.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Have you ever had one?

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Never.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Really?

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's that?

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Even if you don't buy it yourself, your fans sometimes give you an amulet.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Can you trust that?

275
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you throw that amulet on the highway and go to pick it up, you'll get pulled over.

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No one does that.

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Can you avoid the car?

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No one goes to pick it up at high speed.

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What would you do if you were in that situation?

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I wouldn't go to pick it up.

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There's no point in getting pulled over.

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's right.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right?

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's strange.

285
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm not saying that I trust them.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm not saying that I trust them.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If you throw that amulet on the exam hall, you'll get dropped.

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm being told to go out because I'm going to throw it.

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm not saying that because I don't have one.

290
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm just saying that because I'm going to throw it.

291
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But normally, if you throw it, you'll pass the exam.

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What kind of amulet is that?

293
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Nothing.

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you throw that amulet on the exam hall, you won't pass the exam.

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm just saying that because I trust them.

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you throw that amulet on the exam hall, you won't pass the exam.

297
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What kind of example is that?

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Then it's your amulet.

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If you throw that amulet on the exam hall, you won't pass the exam.

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's strange.

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then where did you throw it?

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's just an example.

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just an example.

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You won't pass the exam.

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If you throw it on the exam hall, you won't pass the exam.

306
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But if you're throwing it on the exam hall, you won't pass the exam.

307
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Just as he agreed.

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's not true.

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's strange!

310
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're the one who's strange!

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not strange at all!

312
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't understand what you're saying!

313
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're not even born yet!

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I said it so Aoi would understand!

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not like I'm smart, but...

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I said it so Aoi would understand!

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
People will think my head is in a crash!

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, no! You're in a crash!

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A traffic safety warning!

320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There's that thing hanging from the front window!

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For example, there's a bigger traffic safety warning!

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There's a longer string hanging from the front window!

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You'll hit it someday, right?

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Huh?

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Ah!

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If the traffic safety warning is hanging from the front window, you'll hit it someday, right?

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, that's hanging from the front window?

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Can I take a look at it?

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes, yes, yes!

330
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
At that point, that example is impossible!

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why is it impossible?

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You'll hit it because it's hanging from the front window?

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Isn't that annoying? You should have made it shorter!

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If it's too long, you'll hit it, right?

335
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You'll hit it, right?

336
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, no, no!

337
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't understand that!

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then make it even more understandable!

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you make sunglasses out of the traffic safety warning and walk down the street...

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
At that point, it's over!

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's over, it's over!

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why do you have to make that thing into glasses?

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Even so, if you can't pull it off, I'll trust you!

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The warning!

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You understand what I'm saying, right?

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're shaking your neck, right?

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You understand, right?

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
These people are strange...

349
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, that's about it for today.

350
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, that was quick!

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What is it?

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you want to go to the post office?

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was quick?

354
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It wasn't quick at all! I was talking a lot!

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's been 20 minutes since you left, right?

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You can do 100 rounds!

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's good!

358
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I might be in the White Knight 2.

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, really?

360
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
With that technique?

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Do your best!

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes!

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Please bring out the postcards!

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can stay there and look at me!

365
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not a third party!

366
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I thought it was going to be this interesting!

367
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If you want to see the postcards, you can use this ring and the one she's wearing right now.

368
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This blue zone and this ring.

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is similar to my CX, but this is a special edition.

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I did it the other day, so I'll show it to you.

371
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I did it the other day...

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You should have shown it to me earlier!

373
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I did it the other day...

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't care!

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why don't you show it to me?

376
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't care!

377
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If you show it to me, that's the end of it, right?

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She was born in 1945.

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
How old is she?

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
She's 20.

381
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't have one.

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You don't have one?

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You should put on more makeup.

385
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you very much.

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I heard from a friend that you used to do Chichikurimanbo.

387
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What is it like?

388
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't know Chichikurimanbo.

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You do!

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you know Chichikurimanbo?

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I do.

392
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You do?

393
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't know.

394
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You guys don't know Chichikurimanbo?

395
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Chichikurimanbo? Chichikurimanbo?

396
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Chichikurimanbo!

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you very much.

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's dirty!

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why are you doing that?

400
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know Chichikurimanbo.

401
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What are you doing?

402
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do it!

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't make me cry!

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You do it properly!

405
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I can't do it. It's embarrassing.

406
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm doing it.

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't think I'll be able to do comedy from next year.

408
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
After that, you were dancing.

409
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Do it properly!

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't do it if there are so many people.

411
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why?

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's embarrassing.

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I've been told to do it.

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't do it if I'm applauded like this.

415
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Really?

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't do it.

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You know what I mean, right?

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I know.

420
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I can't do it if people expect me to do it.

421
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We've known each other for a long time.

422
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
When I do it, when I don't do it.

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I know.

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I know.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
When I don't do it.

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I can't do it.

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're still doing it?

428
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's embarrassing.

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why am I doing this?

430
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Last one.

431
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Rumi Yoshida from Ibaraki.

432
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's an Olympics in the last corner of the show.

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I watch it every week.

434
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I always think about it.

435
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Matsumoto is motivated.

436
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hama is not motivated at all.

437
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He looks like he doesn't want to do it.

438
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hama, do you hate that corner?

439
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why are you crying?

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm not motivated.

441
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm really doing it.

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm doing my best.

443
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't lie to me.

444
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't pull out your hand.

445
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're the one who's doing it.

446
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I've never pulled out my hand.

447
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What are you talking about?

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

449
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You haven't pulled out your hand?

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I haven't.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You've pulled out everything.

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm doing my job.

453
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I didn't hear you.

454
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What?

455
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What's wrong?

456
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What?

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Have I ever pulled out my hand?

458
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You've pulled out your hand.

459
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
For example, this kid.

460
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Have I ever pulled out my hand?

461
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I've known it for a long time.

462
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You've pulled out your hand.

463
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How many percent do you think it is today?

464
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I've known it for a long time.

465
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How many percent do you think it is today?

466
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Today...

467
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm really your master.

468
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm not.

469
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm not telling you.

470
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm telling you.

471
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You don't even have a breathing disease.

472
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The doctor told me to stop.

473
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm telling you the truth.

474
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
There's a doctor in Tokyo.

475
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What's the doctor's name?

476
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What?

477
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's Dr. Kuwahara.

478
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What?

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's a doctor in Tokyo.

480
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The doctor told me to stop when I go to school.

481
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Osaka!

482
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was working with Aja Kong today.

483
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I was training Aja Kong with a female professional.

484
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You were just laughing in the ring.

485
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I was trying to catch Aja Kong, but you were laughing.

486
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's why I'm pulling out my hand.

487
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You're pulling out your hand, but you're still walking.

488
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Why don't you walk a little more?

489
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's what it is.

490
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll stab you.

491
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's what it is.

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No one watches the 7 o'clock program on New Year's Day.

493
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hey!

494
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Then you're not in the program.

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course!

496
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
By the way, Masahoto is finally going to the bus game next week.

497
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll show it to you.

498
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I remember that.

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sure the viewers are looking forward to it.

500
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm playing the punishment game next week.

501
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Please watch it.

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What are you doing?

503
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And...

504
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What are you doing?

505
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Special!

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Saturday, December 29th.

507
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
From 2 to 3 o'clock.

508
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We're going to have a special program.

509
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's it for this week.

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We're going to play the punishment game next week.

511
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Please look forward to it.

512
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Good-bye.

513
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's fun.

514
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What are you doing?

515
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Okay.

516
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Thank you for your hard work.

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What are you doing?

518
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Thank you for your hard work.

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What are you doing?

520
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Hey!

521
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Otomo!

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
This program was provided by the sponsor you are watching.
