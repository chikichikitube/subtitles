1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the end, there haven't been many guests recently.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a bit of a shame to have a big guest, but we have to think about it.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know if there's a guest like this in Gaki.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
For example, Hiroko Yakushima.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I saw him a little bit.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I called him.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why are you laughing?

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you see.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you come, Hiroko Yakushima will do this.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm here.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Good morning.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'd like you to come out when you're done.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is that okay?

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm in trouble.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

67
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What's going on?

68
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I made something.

69
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I made one and another.

70
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a combination.

71
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's getting bigger.

72
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You made your own.

73
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think it's that.

74
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I think it's that.

75
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I think it's that.

76
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I think it's that.

77
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think it's that.

78
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think it's that.

79
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't like to talk about private stuff.

80
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I thought I'd quit.

81
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm older than him.

82
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I thought I shouldn't do it.

83
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I broke up with him the other day.

84
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's a big deal.

85
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought I'd quit.

86
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He was crying.

87
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He was crying.

88
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I think he was having a hard time.

89
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I said I'd quit.

90
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I told the lady.

91
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The lady packed my suitcase.

92
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you very much.

93
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Thank you very much.

94
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I said I'd never fall in love again.

95
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I said I'd never fall in love again.

96
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You.

97
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I said I'd leave the laundry.

98
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I left.

99
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Laugh a little more.

100
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Where's the fun?

101
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I quit.

102
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How many days have you been quitting?

103
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Two days.

104
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I quit.

105
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I didn't go in.

106
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I didn't quit.

107
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's amazing if you quit for two days.

108
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How many times have you fallen in love in a week?

109
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Three times a day.

110
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Of course.

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't stop.

112
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Who is it?

113
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I quit.

114
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I quit.

115
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's been two days.

116
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For example, it's like a rehearsal.

117
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you practice too much, you can't do well in the actual performance.

118
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you mean?

119
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you spend too much time on practice, you won't get excited in the actual performance.

120
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you understand?

121
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What's the difference between the actual performance and practice?

122
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's different, but I want to be more sensitive.

123
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's because you practice too much every day.

124
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you practice every day, you can't do well in the actual performance.

125
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you like?

126
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, I'm the same as you.

127
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Laugh a little more.

128
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
When I was in junior high school, I didn't think I was doing that much.

129
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I didn't think I was doing that much.

130
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I thought adults couldn't do it.

131
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Now I'm 34 years old.

132
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't do it at all.

133
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm surprised.

134
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're very good at it.

135
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
When I was in elementary school, my father was still doing it.

136
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's right.

137
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I thought I'd quit.

138
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I see.

139
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You haven't been to the video shop these two days.

140
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes, that's right.

141
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Which one?

142
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Which one did you go to and which one didn't?

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well...

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I did it yesterday.

145
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You did it?

146
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why are you lying?

147
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why are you lying?

148
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think it's cool.

149
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is it cool?

150
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm getting angry.

151
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Why are you lying to me?

152
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm laughing.

153
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Why are you lying to me?

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't want to talk about this, but I'll tell you one thing.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I've never done it without any punishment.

156
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I see.

157
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I want to do it once.

158
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I've never tried it.

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I want to do it without any punishment once.

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I see.

161
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I want to do it without any punishment once.

162
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't think I should quit.

163
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why?

164
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I have children.

165
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's not like I'm doing it in front of you.

166
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If I do it in front of you, the kids will be surprised too.

167
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mom!

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Dad!

169
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hurry up!

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It can't be helped if this story gets too big.

171
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It can't be helped if this story gets too big.

172
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's start with the first one.

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You say good things.

174
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Cyborg!

175
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's Cyborg Koichi!

176
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is Cyborg Koichi!

177
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It seems like you've seen him before.

178
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, is that so?

179
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If you talk like that, I'll go to the exam.

180
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You like the name Cyborg Koichi, don't you?

181
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

182
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Who gave you that name?

183
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The president of the gym.

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When he comes back next time,

185
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll give him a name like Soreike.

186
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Like Hatshin.

187
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It might be better to give him a name like that.

188
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hatshin.

189
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It might be better to give him a name like that.

190
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's like a cyborg.

191
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right.

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,580
It's like he's been

193
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think that too.

194
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's better to give him a name with a lot of codes.

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Something like short.

196
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's right. And the president should be more like a doctor.

197
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll prepare it for you.

198
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
When you take a shower and come back to the gym,

199
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
what do you think is the coolest thing to do?

200
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't think it's cool.

201
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What do you do?

202
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
For example,

203
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you say, I'm going to take a shower.

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And you go.

205
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I think it's a bath towel.

206
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not sure if it's my waist.

207
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Your waist?

208
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Your waist?

209
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm not sure if it's my waist.

210
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's like this.

211
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm not sure if it's my waist.

212
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
How long do you wait?

213
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But it's like this in bed.

214
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's like the gate of youth.

215
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're pretty good.

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's not good.

217
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's not good.

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then the woman...

219
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why are you standing up like that?

220
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm talking to you.

221
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's hard for the woman to get in.

222
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's not good.

223
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What do you want to do?

224
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, there are three.

225
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry, but...

226
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you the coolest thing.

227
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why?

228
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because I've been working on it for a long time.

229
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Isn't that right?

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's not good.

231
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I've been working on it for a long time.

232
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I was thinking about it when I was in the first year of high school.

233
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's old.

234
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Are you still working on it?

235
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Then I'll tell you the second one.

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay, then the second one.

238
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When a woman comes out, she's holding her pants up against the wall.

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
She's reading a book.

240
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
She's reading a book when she comes out.

241
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Isn't that cool?

242
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know if I can finish reading it.

243
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's not true.

244
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When she comes out, she's reading a book.

245
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
When she says, Oh, you're here.

246
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is where it gets cool.

247
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
She takes out a bath towel.

248
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And she puts it in her mouth.

249
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You'll know what's next.

250
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The continuation.

251
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The continuation of the next one.

252
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You'll know what's next.

253
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The best one.

254
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I want to hear the best one.

255
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll tell you later.

256
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What do you mean later?

257
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
After a little while.

258
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll tell you the second one.

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't think about it.

260
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't think about it.

261
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It exists in reality.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You just have to untie the ribbon.

263
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You don't have to wait to untie the ribbon.

264
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
There's something like that.

265
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Animals often tell humans about danger.

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
When rabbits make a noise, earthquakes occur.

267
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When birds make a noise, fires occur.

268
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Please tell us about the behavior of animals that tell us about other disasters.

269
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Well, I don't know what's good.

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Anything is fine.

271
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is there a dog that's as loose as that?

272
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There's a dog, too.

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is that so?

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What would a dog do?

275
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's a dog, too.

276
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Cats wash their faces.

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There's a dog, too.

278
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What?

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
There's a dog.

280
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

281
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What are you talking about?

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm talking about a dog.

283
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Is there a dog?

284
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There is a dog.

285
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What?

286
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I told you there was a dog.

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Please tell us about the behavior of animals that tell us about other disasters.

288
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
To put it simply, I can't think of anything.

289
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can't think of anything.

290
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't even panic.

291
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You can't even panic.

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I want to lie down.

293
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But if I say something like this, people will think I'm running away.

294
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
People will think you're running away.

295
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I hate it when people turn their backs on me.

296
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't like that.

297
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't like running away.

298
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't run away.

299
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I want to end it with this.

300
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You want to end it with this?

301
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This time, I'll make you run away.

302
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll make you run away with your back to me.

303
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:14,000
When a woman comes back to a new chair after taking a shower, what is the coolest thing to do?

304
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You're really good at killing your partner.

305
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You're a free hunter.

306
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You know what?

307
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yes?

308
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I really feel it.

309
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I really feel the feelings of each and every one of the guests.

310
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're still trying to run away, aren't you?

311
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I see.

312
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's what you think, right?

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you stupid?

314
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's not true.

315
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Why?

316
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Mama, Aniki, Mama.

317
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm going to end it.

318
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Right?

319
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's right.

320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You're crazy.

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm thinking about it.

322
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm thinking about it right now.

323
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm thinking about it right now.

324
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

325
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I've been lying for a long time, too.

326
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, you're a jerk.

327
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If Akko refused this, let's think about it.

328
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I can't plan anymore.

329
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yes.

330
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm going to the mountain.

331
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah.

332
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes.

333
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Was it like that in the morning?

334
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I want you to come to the party

335
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I want you to come to the party

336
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:19,000
