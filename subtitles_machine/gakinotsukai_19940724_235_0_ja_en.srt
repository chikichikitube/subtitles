1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
GAKUYA before the show.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
As usual, he had a hard time in the opening show.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
However, Mr.Hitoshi Matsumoto wanted to do something.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What should I do?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've tried a lot of things.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Recently, I've been away from the challenge.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to participate in the challenge series this time.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mr.Hitoshi Matsumoto has succeeded in many challenges so far.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What kind of challenge will he do this time?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I ran up the stairs on a motorcycle.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Many people say that I succeeded in many challenges.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But I didn't think it was that big a deal.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's not talk about dangerous things.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's not talk about big things.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I have a different way of thinking.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The meaning of the word Dantan comes from the word Kamihitoe.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's a good idea.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is a talk show, right?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, it's not.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a stunt show.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to die.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In a sense, right?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to die.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Even if you say that, if you listen to my challenge today, I think you'll think it's a good idea.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Speaking of summer, what is it?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've been thinking about it since last week.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Speaking of summer, it's a roller coaster.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why is it a roller coaster in the summer?

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going to be pulled by a roller coaster this time.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is summer, isn't it?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's strange.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A Japanese summer windmill, a roller coaster.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Will it be able to overcome this 10-ton wheel?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a desperate challenge for a roller coaster.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you okay?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think it's okay.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why?

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you okay?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I think it's breathing.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you come to Lamaze 4, Lamaze 4.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If a roller coaster comes at just the right time to breathe, I think you can go there.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it okay?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm going to die.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, it doesn't have to do with ratings.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to do it again.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's true.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't help it if I want to do it.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to die.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Really.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Even if you don't know, I want you to see it.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not doing it.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I want to do it.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm not doing it.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll do it.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I really don't know.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Do it.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll see it.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Do you understand?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
With Matsumoto Hitoshi, who is determined to die, he heads to the scene.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hitoshi's whole body is stiff because of the extreme tension.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is it okay this time?

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Unexpected anxiety surpasses Hitoshi's ability.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hamada can't hide his anxiety in this reckless challenge.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Something's wrong with your skin.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hitoshi wants to get some air outside, so he shows his face from the window.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He desperately fights against the anxiety that comes just before the show.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hitoshi, what are you looking at now?

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's late.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He's late.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's eat.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're ready, aren't you?

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you don't hurry up, it'll be too late.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's hurry up.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's a talk.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here it comes.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's coming.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's good.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He's really strong.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I saw you racing yesterday, but I'm sure you'll die.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's dangerous.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you okay?

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's better to talk.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm focused.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Look at the roller coaster over there.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Look at the roller coaster.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Did you get in?

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please stop.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you doing?

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's okay.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's okay.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Get out of the way.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's dangerous.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't care.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll do it.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's okay.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's do it properly.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's a talk.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's go.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Please start the engine.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please start the engine.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've been waiting.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's okay.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's start the engine.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you for the great adventure.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We will never forget your courage and your way of life.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Thank you very much.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What a wonderful figure.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Look at this.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Pretend you're wearing it.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm not wearing it at all.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll wear it if I wear it.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If I don't wear it, I'll leave it in the dressing room.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But I don't care.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't care.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I want you.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Here.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's nice.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a nice figure.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Is that so?

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm a little annoyed these days.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been doing a lot of Takanohana bashing.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The other day, right?

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I kicked the wall.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I poured water on it.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I've been doing it.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's a Takanohana bashing.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't care.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't care.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I see.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's what you think.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What is next?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What is next?

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yokozuna and?

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's start from the top.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are the top three worst?

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well.

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What is it?

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What is the next best?

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ozeki.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yokozuna should be put here, right?

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yokozuna.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sekiwake.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Komusubi.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wonderful!

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know much, so I can't be stupid.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm scared of saying things I don't know.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If I say it, I'll get hit.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you say it, you'll get hit.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a battle field.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a battle field.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's strange. I've been waiting for you.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
G-5 threw a bat at the ball.

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What do you mean he threw a bat?

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you doing with a fresh ball?

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You guys are kicking that fresh ball.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I just threw a ball and threw it.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's strange.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For example, if you throw a bat at a man you're looking at, he'll get angry.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Of course.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But even if you kick a man, he'll get angry.

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why do you make a soccer ball and a man two?

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A man has nothing to do with it.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But it's an elephant.

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You have something to say about that, right?

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Are you interested?

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was doing it.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're just saying nonsense.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
When did you do it?

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't do it, but I can't complain.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know about that, but you're doing it like this.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What does that mean?

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you mean?

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I just said what do you mean.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why do you say what do you mean right away?

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You do this after you win, right?

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I do it about three times.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Does that mean anything?

211
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Of course it does.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Mom.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Mom.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's my dad's line.

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I can say it now.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You said mom three times.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, no, no.

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mom, dad.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right?

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Who is it?

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Say it.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Relatives.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's not true.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There's a reason for that.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Thank you.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Really.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Really.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I understand that.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why do you say that?

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ah.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's about Sagariko.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sagariko?

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sagariko?

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Did you just say Sagariko?

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's a Japanese national flag.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Before I go to Tokyo, I say Sagariko to Tsukibito.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes, it's Sagariko.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
4,800 yen.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's cheap.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's not cheap.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's expensive.

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's cheap. 4,800 yen.

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Does it make sense?

248
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Of course it does.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Of course it does.

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why are you wearing it?

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can I say that?

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What?

253
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What?

254
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't know. I want to hear it.

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Can I say that?

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Who are you talking to?

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Who are you talking to?

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Who are you talking to?

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No?

260
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No?

261
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No?

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No?

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No?

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No?

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Who are you talking to?

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There's a reason for that.

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You were laughing.

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was laughing.

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I did all of it.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What are your special skills?

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're really stupid.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you have a special skill, it means you have a special skill that you're not good at.

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you go back to the beginning.

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm the almighty.

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So I can't choose what my special skill is.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So what are the skills you've been doing frequently?

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Skills I've been doing frequently?

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Can I say that?

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Kama Soto Gari.

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Kama Soto Gari?

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
From Kama Soto Gari to Uchi Gake.

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Uchi Wake.

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Which one?

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's more interesting.

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
From Kama Soto Gari to Uchi Wake.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Uchi Wake?

288
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Can you do it for me?

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
From Kama Soto Gari to Uchi Wake.

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you do?

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
First of all, how do I get into your voice?

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Just go in like this.

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Wait a minute.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I step on you?

295
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can step on me.

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
From Kama Soto Gari to...

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This is Kama Soto Gari.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
From the outside.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Kama Soto Gari.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Kama Soto Gari.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
From the outside.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's beautiful.

303
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Draw a circle.

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
From there, Uchi Wake.

305
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What is Uchi Wake?

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
In the end, it's a fortune of 4800 yen.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Who is that Uchi Wake?

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You say that to people, but do you play sports?

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't play.

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I sometimes play golf.

311
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I stopped playing once.

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No, I don't understand the rules of golf.

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
When you decide the path, you shouldn't go sideways.

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You don't have to go sideways.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But even if you just walk like this, you'll say,

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's like I'm standing on my own.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, no.

318
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you step on it and go,

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think it's a little hooked.

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
After that, I think it's a little sliced.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't know if there is such a thing.

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then the ball line changes.

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't know if the ball line changes.

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If that's how the ball line changes,

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't do that.

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why?

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why?

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
With a small stone.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But you did it once and quit.

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There was no such scene once.

331
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You quit because you didn't hit the ball.

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No.

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You hit it.

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I didn't hit it.

335
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, you didn't.

336
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I didn't hit it.

337
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No matter how strange it is, you hit it.

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It just so happened that the hole was over there.

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If it was over here, it was in.

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No, it just so happened that the hole was over here.

341
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You hit it with your eyes open.

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No.

343
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was aiming for my own hole.

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No, no, no.

345
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I was aiming for my own hole.

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What are you talking about?

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There's only one.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's only one.

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's only one.

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You hit it with your eyes open.

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You guys were aiming for your own hole.

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't want to do the same thing as you.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Everyone does the same thing.

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, no, no.

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't want to do the same thing as you.

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No, no.

358
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You were aiming for your own hole.

359
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You were aiming for your own hole.

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't want to do that.

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was aiming for my own hole.

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why are you so hard on him?

363
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Japanese people lie right away.

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What are you talking about?

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What are you talking about?

366
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to burn you.

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't change my mind.

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey.

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Ignore.

370
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't care.

371
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Aren't you Japanese?

372
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No.

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I've been wondering about this for a while.

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There are many rescue ships in the mountains of the Alps.

375
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's a small barrel hanging around your neck.

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What is that small barrel?

377
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What is that?

378
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
St. Bernard.

379
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's right.

380
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What is the purpose of the dogs?

381
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Isn't there alcohol in the barrel?

382
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's a mistake.

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Isn't it?

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
There's no doubt about the barrel.

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The reason I chose this document is because there's a big mistake.

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Is it a mistake?

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You've seen a barrel, haven't you?

388
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What is a barrel?

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's something like this.

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The big one.

392
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's a barrel.

393
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But there's a small one.

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, no, no.

395
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's a big barrel hanging around your neck.

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No, no, no.

397
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's small.

398
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No, no, no.

399
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's not a small barrel.

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, no, no.

401
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a dog hanging around your neck.

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, no, no.

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a dog hanging around your neck.

404
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, no.

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a small barrel.

406
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Who is it?

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is it your grandmother?

408
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's your grandmother, isn't it?

409
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's a small barrel.

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a big barrel.

411
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, no, no.

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's a dog hanging around your neck.

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, no, no.

414
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a big barrel.

415
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You see a dog hanging around your neck on TV, don't you?

416
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes, I do.

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Why don't you think it's a big dog?

418
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Why don't you think it's a small barrel?

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The dog is big.

420
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's about this big.

421
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
How can it be a big dog?

422
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Is it about this big?

423
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes.

424
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This is a question for Mr. Hamada.

425
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
When I see your comments, I'm surprised because I see Mr. Matsumoto's forehead and his nose.

426
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I heard that you have 15 other comments.

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I do?

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What kind of comments do you have?

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like this.

431
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It used to be like this.

432
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And then, like this.

433
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And here and here at the same time.

434
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Wait.

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Does it hurt?

436
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A little bit more.

437
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Ah, sorry.

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And what else?

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's strange.

440
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like this.

441
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It used to be like this.

442
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, it used to be like this.

443
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
A little bit more.

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Right now, I'm not fooling around.

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not going to do that.

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You know, right?

447
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes, I know.

448
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I know everything.

449
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I know everything.

450
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's Hamada-kun, right?

451
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's right.

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's right.

453
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You know me, right?

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Matsumoto-kun.

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Matsumoto-kun.

456
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Matsumoto-kun.

457
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Okay, okay.

458
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, there are things like that.

459
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There are, right?

460
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What else is there?

461
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Other than that...

462
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
In my way...

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
In your way, there are 15 things, right?

464
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Well...

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
A little bit more.

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
A little bit more?

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It hurts so much.

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It hurts so much.

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The audience might get angry.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But I was laughing.

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know, I can't bring my hand to my forehead right now, right?

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Right now.

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It hurts.

474
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do you know why?

475
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know.

476
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I feel like I'm bleeding.

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There's something I don't understand.

478
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Why does Love Hotel take 2 hours?

479
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Well, isn't it about 2 hours?

480
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, is that so?

481
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, you can take a bath, too.

482
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Together?

483
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, it's an individual service.

484
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If you're always doing it, you should take a bath together.

485
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I've never taken a bath with a girl.

486
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Have you ever taken a bath together?

487
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes, I have.

488
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm an old man.

489
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why?

490
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Why?

491
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think there are a lot of things to decide with an old man.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Am I one of them?

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's an old man to take a bath with a woman.

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Is that so?

495
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm an old man.

496
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And I'm old enough to eat sushi while laughing.

497
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm young enough to do that.

498
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Young enough to do that?

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's...

500
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's true.

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's true.

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No.

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's funny.

504
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's funny to talk.

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
While laughing.

506
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's an old man.

507
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's not true.

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Old men eat sushi while laughing.

509
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's true.

510
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's not true.

511
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's true.

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's not true.

513
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You're like a kindergarten kid.

514
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Naginagi-chan.

515
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Ko-chan, Ko-chan.

516
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Is that true?

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Is that true?

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's true.

519
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Old man.

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's...

521
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's a funny way to do it.

522
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.
