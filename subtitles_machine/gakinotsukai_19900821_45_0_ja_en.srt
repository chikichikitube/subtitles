1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Eh?

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Eh?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Congratulations!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is from the staff.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's from the heart.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ah! Stop it!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's still going to take some time.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Next time, at the Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Chikichiki's new gym,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
let's dance with Hiroko-chan!

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now...

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The pain in the butt hurts.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What are you doing?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What do you know?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today's opening is...

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to do some new exercises.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Are you okay?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You haven't been using your body too much lately.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sometimes it's good.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Today, I'm going to use my little finger.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's introduce him right away.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's Hiroko Yamazaki-san!

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Nice to meet you too.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You seem to be light.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ah, you're saying I'm thin?

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, you're saying you're going to be able to do it soon.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're saying I'm light from the back of your mouth.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's the only thing I can think of.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What do you mean I'm light?

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're really light, right?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, I'm really light.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You idiot.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're a fairy.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You've been teaching people how to do it for the first time, haven't you?

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The other day, I did it with Ucchan-Nanchan's Sharara.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Please write it down.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I did it.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You were really good at it.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm really good at it.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Comedians are really good at it.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Really?

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They have a good head.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Like this.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really, really.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can't do it at all.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll teach you.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
First of all, I'll teach you the key points.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll show you how to do it.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That was a fierce attack.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where are you going?

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hold on.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's amazing.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I went to the Olympics.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It hurts.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What are the key points of the ball?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There are two difficult points.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The first is a big jump.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A big jump?

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A big jump.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have to step forward with your left foot.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Raise your right foot forward and leave your left foot behind.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's Kin-chan.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A wide balance.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not yet.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A big jump.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't do it at all.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll show you how to do it.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't do it at all.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The ball is difficult.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's really difficult.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What would you score if you won the Olympics?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't do it.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't do it at all.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can't do it at all.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's like a white butterfly floating on the water.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's like a white butterfly floating on the water.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hiroko-chan.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Please show me how to throw it.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This?

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is impossible.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a little difficult.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is that so?

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For an amateur...

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't make fun of me.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not high.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's something like this.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Throw it over there.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't see it.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's coming back.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is amazing.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is it.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Please show me how to throw it.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Please show me how to throw it.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please show me how to throw it.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't have time to change it.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do your best.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
More.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's right.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's right.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't bend your legs.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's difficult.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How was it?

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Compared to Uchiyama Nan-chan.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not just physical training.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Practice is the first.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll give you this.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's have a confrontation next time.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you going to throw it?

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll judge you.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's a good idea.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Uchiyama-sensei.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll practice at home.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The people below are angry.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The clothes have changed.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've been studying a lot lately.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you talking about?

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You touch it.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Men touch it a lot.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They touch it a lot.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's different from feeling.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's meaningless.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's meaningless to touch it.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a religious story.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have to touch it.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I see.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've been doing a lot of research lately.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I want you to listen to my research.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why is the world so self-conscious?

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a mass of self-consciousness.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Women are especially self-conscious.

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Really?

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why?

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Women used to walk on the street at night.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They don't have any intention.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But they want to be popular.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They want to be popular.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's self-consciousness.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But there are people who are actually doing that.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't think so.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I run away, I'll be angry.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you run away, you'll be angry.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll sleep.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I sometimes think that men will be angry and do it.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you do that, you'll be angry.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There are definitely women who get angry because of that.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There are 520,000 women in this summer.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why?

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
520,000 women?

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What is that?

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's a lot of women.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's self-consciousness.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Even animals are self-conscious.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When I was in junior high school, I was a newspaper writer.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I wanted to put a newspaper in the newspaper.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Self-consciousness.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You didn't do anything.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You didn't do anything.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's not good.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's self-consciousness.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is self-consciousness?

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
A pigeon.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It doesn't eat.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't think so.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are people who have been eaten.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's not good.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's self-consciousness.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Even children are self-conscious.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Children are like that.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Children come out.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I press the brake.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This hand is self-consciousness.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My car can't stop with your hand.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A cat is self-consciousness.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll hide it.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No one will see it.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Cats like to be beautiful.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll hide it.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No one will see your poop.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll take it.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There is no such thing as self-consciousness.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There are people who run.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I can't wait as much as you think.

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you talking about?

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you say that, you can't do anything.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you talking about?

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you talking about?

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You are also self-conscious.

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you talking about?

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Everyone is self-conscious.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm just sitting.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's wrong.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There is no such thing as self-consciousness.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why is everyone self-conscious?

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Who?

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why is everyone self-conscious?

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This?

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Self-conscious.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why?

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why?

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is self-consciousness.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why?

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You are thinking while saying.

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not thinking.

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why?

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why?

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't need it.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your hand is holding it.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't care.

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why?

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can't see it as much as you're trying.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can see it.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's in front of you.

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Your hat is also self-conscious.

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why?

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't want to see your head.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're wearing it because you don't want to see it.

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why is the cameraman self-conscious?

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's self-conscious.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why?

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Why?

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't need it.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why?

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Tell me right away.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why?

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Tell me right away.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why?

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't want to see the color of your polo shirt.

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It doesn't matter.

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Everyone says so.

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Everyone says so.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is Tokyo ramen.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Really?

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't understand.

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will continue my research.

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There is no research.

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's self-conscious.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There is no research.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's not self-conscious.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why?

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What?

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Everyone says so.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Everyone says so.

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Everyone says so.

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There is a woman.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
She is a good woman.

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But she wants me.

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There is a woman who wants you.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I want you.

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I want you.

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't say that.

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I didn't say that.

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I didn't say that.

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't want you.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What kind of woman do you want me to be?

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There is a woman who wants to hug you.

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There is a woman who wants to hug you.

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know.

270
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I am old now.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm old.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There is an old woman.

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I am a dirty old woman.

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't see you.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I open my legs and see you.

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't see you.

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What is this?

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is dirty.

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, it's just that I can't find the right position.

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's strange, isn't it?

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If you don't live carefully, I'll be watching you.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't have a blind spot.

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Even if you're watching, there are only a few people.

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's no way everyone will be watching.

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're just watching because you don't want to.

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You think it's a skier lover, don't you?

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's not like that.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's like a woman riding a car with a woman.

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's enough.

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a highway.

291
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I said, let's go to my room.

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You said, huh?

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You said, huh?

294
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You said, huh?

295
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You said, huh?

296
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You said, huh?

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You said, huh?

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You said, huh?

299
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You said, huh?

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You said, huh?

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You said, huh?

302
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You said, huh?

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You said, huh?

304
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You're asking me to go see a doctor.

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why are you saying, huh?

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I know you're a human being, so why are you saying, huh?

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You've already taken one step into the room.

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're always like that, huh?

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're not going to do anything when I give you a room like that, are you?

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're lying, huh?

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If I ask her if she can help me with my knowledge, she doesn't listen to me

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If that's the case, I'll go!

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You're talking and then you close the door and start talking

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not like that, but I'll do it

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hagi!

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Where was I hiding?

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You never show your staff

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Today you're dressed like this

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hello

321
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Let me introduce you

322
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hey!

323
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's dirty!

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did you really just come out?

325
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When you went like this, you looked like a capsule

326
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I said before that I was going to go

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Even then, when you went like this, you looked like a capsule

328
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Capsule?

329
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There are times when you look like a grain

330
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What's white?

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Fuji-kun, Nao-chan

332
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go ahead

333
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's okay, I'm saying it in front of you

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
She's 20 years old

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
She read the book

336
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Eiken 39

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Tekondo 59

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're lying!

339
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you refuse to train?

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Did you refuse to train?

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You said you didn't want to train

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Is there something wrong with your body?

343
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Is there something wrong with your stomach?

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I forgot, it's cool

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's a hole here

346
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is there something cool about it?

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you want it?

348
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't care

349
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's starting to stand out

350
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not me!

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thank you

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I heard you released a photo book

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What is it?

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did it sell well?

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My friend is looking for it in a bookstore

357
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I heard it wasn't in a certain country

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't think you'll find it

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Tell her to give up

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I saw it in Osaka the other day

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's still selling well in Osaka

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How much did it sell?

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's amazing

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think it sold well

365
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The page in the middle

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't see the two of them

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They were in a state similar to Zenra

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It felt good

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Even though it was a joke

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They were doing well

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They were over 5

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let's talk about this

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is 18-year-old Minako from Saitama

374
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Have you two had a scary experience?

375
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please tell us

376
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The other day, I saw a ghost-like thing

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
with the left half of Mach-chan and the right half of Hama-chan

378
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's scary

379
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I saw a dream where I was chased and ran away crying

380
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You ran away

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's scary

382
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's not that scary

383
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's not scary

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's not that scary

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's just a sad story

386
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I've never seen it

387
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There are times when I feel like something is going to happen

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
When you hear a sound

389
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Even if you're in a room

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Like a sound

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Why does it sound like that?

392
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's like a rap

393
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's proof that it came out

394
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Like a click

395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No, no

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's not like that

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's like that

398
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Why does it sound like that?

399
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's not like that

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's like a click

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The click is old

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's not like that

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's not like that

404
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's like a floor

405
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What is that?

406
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't think it's a rap

407
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why does it sound like that?

408
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
When there's nothing in the middle of the night

409
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's a rap

410
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What does that mean?

411
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It came out

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't see it

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can see it

414
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It came out

415
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Why?

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a rap

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't ask me that

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I get it

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Rap

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why does it sound like that?

421
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you talking about?

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Isn't it strange?

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Isn't there a time when you sing?

424
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't know

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're scary

426
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You don't feel like it

427
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You don't know

428
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Ah

429
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If you say that

430
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm scared

431
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ah

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know

433
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Whose ghost is it?

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm scared

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
For example, if I die

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If I die

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If I come out, are you scared?

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm scared

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
In a different sense

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know what to do

441
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's not it

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Are you scared?

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If I come out, are you scared?

444
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't do anything

445
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I just come out

446
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sleeping

447
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you scared?

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know

449
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Are you scared?

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm scared

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I can only see you

452
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't see anyone else

453
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm always there during the day

454
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
When I die

455
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I come out

456
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I can only see you

457
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm always there during the day

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You can see me

459
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yes

460
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't come out

461
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't see anyone else

462
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I can't come out

463
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm always there

464
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Ah

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's amazing

466
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Today, we did the opening

468
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We did

469
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It was difficult

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It was difficult

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You watched it

472
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I think it was good

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
My body is getting better

474
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's right

475
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
My body

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't play

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What do you think about

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the battle with

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Uchiyama?

480
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Ah

481
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If he

482
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
does it according to

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
my schedule

484
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If he does it

485
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
according to my schedule

486
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't care

487
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He's busy

488
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He's busy

489
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Uchiyama?

490
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes

491
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Masaki

492
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
has a lot of work

493
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Then

494
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't refuse him

495
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well

496
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Well

497
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If it's according to

498
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
my schedule

499
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I can do it

500
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And

501
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Next week

502
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll do the

503
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
child's play

504
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll do it

505
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
All the guests

506
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
are men

507
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't know

508
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Please look forward to it

509
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And

510
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
send me more costumes

511
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Well

512
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't care

513
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
about you

514
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't care

515
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
about you

516
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Well

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't care

518
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
There's a limit to what we can do

519
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Well

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There are fans

521
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and fans

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Please send me

523
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
all the costumes

524
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Thank you

525
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And

526
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll do the child's play

527
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey

528
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't know

529
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't care
