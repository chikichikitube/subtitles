00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Tsuki Tsuki Henshin Bijouate Contest!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today's opening act is amazing.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's a person with a slightly frowning face.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a simple game to guess who that person is.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's introduce the answer right away.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The director of Takasu Clinic is Mr. Takasu Katsuya.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm a professional, so please look at me carefully.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Next to me is Ms. Kiyoko Takagi.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And last but not least, Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto, a man of justice.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Have you ever been called a man of justice?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, I have a license for that.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You have two licenses?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I have a license.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You have two licenses?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're a professional, aren't you?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's right.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
With your teacher?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
With a certain eye?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Teacher, that's a license.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Liar!

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's go to the first question.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here it comes!

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How many of you have a license?

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How many of you have a license?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's the first question.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wait a minute.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're not going to tell me where it is, are you?

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can just say your face.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a tattoo.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't really understand, but when was it?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
When did you get it?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got it this year.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This year?

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right. It was about three months ago.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's not a very meaningful question, is it?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then just say it!

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In a month, the tattoo will be gone.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have a question.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What made you the happiest when you got your license?

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, I'm happy when people tell me I'm cute.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
When I put on makeup.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When you put on makeup?

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why is your hair so messy?

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's because I did it.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's because I saw myself.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everyone, please come up to the stage.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's start with Mr. Takatsu.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Number two, number four.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. Takagi.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Number one.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mr. Miyaburiman.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Number four, your hair is so messy, right?

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think that's a fake tattoo.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's not true.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's start.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The real tattooist is this person.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The correct answer is number two and number four.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Miyaburiman.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Amazing.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The tattooist does it to be beautiful.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So if you don't choose a beautiful person, there's no mistake.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But number four has more hair than number four.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's why I know this.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's why I know this.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is the last question.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You successfully went on a diet.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's already beautiful.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's done to be beautiful.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So let's have that person answer.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Please ask everyone a question.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's inside.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Can I ask how many months you lost weight?

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's a good question.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How many months did you lose weight?

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
About half a year.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Half a year?

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How many kilograms?

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How many kilograms did you lose weight?

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I lost 30 kilograms in half a year.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How many kilograms did you lose before losing weight?

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Before losing weight?

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
65 kilograms.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Before losing weight, 65 kilograms.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How many months?

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How many kilograms?

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
17 kilograms in four months.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
17 kilograms in four months.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's the most reasonable number.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The tattooist is...

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's the most painful number.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How many kilograms before losing weight?

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
110 kilograms.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
110 kilograms?

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How many kilograms did you lose before losing weight?

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Before losing weight,

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the tattooist didn't make a fuss if an animal or something approached him.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How many kilograms did you lose before losing weight?

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
30 kilograms.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
30 kilograms?

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ask him what his nickname was when he was fat.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Is that so?

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Fatty.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's a fatty.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What was his nickname when he was fat?

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Dadan.

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What was his nickname when he was fat?

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Butcher.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Butcher.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please draw your answer.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Please draw your answer, Mr. Takahashi.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Number two.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Number two.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Takagi.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Number two.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Number two.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Takagi.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is my hope.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I want this to happen.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You want this to happen, right?

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I understand.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Number two.

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Number two.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Number three.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
One by one, please come out from the box on the back.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
First, number one.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please come out.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm powering you up.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Number two, please come out.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Please come out.

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Number two.

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wow.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're happy?

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you draw your answer, your father will come out, right?

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I drew my answer.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Your father is a cat?

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes.

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's a cat now.

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I'd rather draw my answer before I get fat.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey.

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't say that.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This person is Masumoto's hope.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is...

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's even thinner.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please come out.

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Number three, please come out.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's open.

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wow.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Amazing.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey, hey, hey.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Number two.

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you think of number one and number three?

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I went to an aesthetic shop.

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I recommend that.

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You go to an aesthetic shop.

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you pay first, you can buy it with your guts.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I see.

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So if you say you're going to pay little by little later, it won't last long.

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
By the way, if number three has that kind of money, he'll eat something sweet.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hello.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How are you doing recently?

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What do you mean?

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm thinking.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There are many kinds of luck, right?

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There are many kinds of luck, right?

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you have any good luck?

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Good luck...

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have...

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Chigami luck.

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well...

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is Matsumoto's aesthetic luck.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Chigami luck is really bad.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You can't get it when you want it.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well...

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You go to the toilet, right?

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You poop, right?

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You poop at the public toilet, right?

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I do.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, there are times when you don't have Chigami luck.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You don't check it when you go to the public toilet?

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you want to poop, you should open it first.

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I open it.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I open it.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I open it, right?

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have it.

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's good.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't have to worry about it anymore.

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And when I'm done, I look at it carefully.

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's just a thick roll of paper.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's just one sheet.

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There are times when it's just one sheet.

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's entangled.

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's entangled.

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's entangled.

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you call it Chigami luck in that sense?

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's bad. It's too bad.

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There's a stock, right?

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There is.

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's normal.

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can buy it.

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can buy it?

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If I go in, I can't buy it.

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I see.

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Have you ever bought it?

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I went in this year and bought it about five times.

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Really, really.

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If it's Chigami luck, I've been entangled myself.

220
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't have any luck.

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't have any luck.

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a toilet where everyone goes in and out.

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So I've spent the rest of my life meaningfully.

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong with that?

225
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I raised it.

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There's a guy like this.

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This guy.

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I put this guy in like this.

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And then I put it in like this.

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I see.

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're going in and out.

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I put it in like this.

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What's wrong with me?

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I shouldn't be doing such a thing.

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't help it.

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But I've been in this year and bought it about three months ago.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I've bought it four or five times.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm so angry.

239
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not so much outside.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's sometimes at home.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can buy it.

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I can't help it.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's annoying.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why do you think I shouldn't do that?

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can buy it somehow.

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I've bought a lot of work.

247
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Some things are hard to do.

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I can do it.

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then...

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's like a telecom.

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's like a telecom.

252
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can go up here.

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can go up here.

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have to tear it by hand.

255
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's cheap.

256
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have to tear it by hand.

257
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not like that.

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There's a wire.

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There's no wire.

260
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But it feels so good...

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
when two wires meet.

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I can't use it.

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't cut it by myself.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a lie.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've never done that before.

268
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't cut it.

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,500
I can't stop at the point where the electric wire and the electric wire cross each other.

270
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
That's annoying.

271
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
That's because I'm taking care of that.

272
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
What's the point of this guy?

273
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not that he's different, it's just that he doesn't want to get wet.

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,500
Ah, he doesn't want to get wet.

275
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I can see it, but it's better to do it properly.

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
That's why I don't have that luck.

277
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,900
They're all sitting like a stone water அ

278
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,000
Even if he sits like this in the movie theater,

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,500
Even if it was empty before,

280
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,000
The air is very tight later

281
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,300
Even if it's just a little bit bisa

282
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,000
Pthat's the annoyance when he stands up

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
All the big guys sound like married womenI

284
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't we?

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There is, there is.

286
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's not that big, so I let him sit in the front.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But he's not that tall.

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But his face is like Indica Mai.

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What?

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Indica Mai.

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What's Indica Mai?

292
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's like a long rice.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't get it!

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's like Indica Mai.

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's long?

296
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's good for pilaf.

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know about that.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't like it when people touch me.

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Really?

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't like it when people touch me.

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When I was a kid, I got hit by Warabimochi once.

304
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What?

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Warabimochi?

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Warabimochi is...

307
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like this.

308
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Warabimochi is like this.

309
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Like this?

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I got hit by Warabimochi.

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't get hit by anything else.

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I got hit by gum or something.

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I got hit by two or three things.

315
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I got hit by a super jet.

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What?

318
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I got hit by a belt and a cape.

319
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You got hit by a super jet?

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You got hit by a super jet?

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

323
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You couldn't get hit by it?

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No.

325
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You couldn't get it?

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
heard something.

327
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Is that all?

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I heard you perched for a while then.

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Stop it.

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Really?

332
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Stop it.

333
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I heard it only for a week and then stopped.

334
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Also, you know, there is something like this...

335
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
A yellow aberration hat with dirt on it and it is sour.

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Like a ring.

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
After I threw it, that yellow hat,

338
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
When I threw it, it spread out and

339
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was such a big stick hat.

340
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I twisted it and folded it.

341
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It became a circle.

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was like a bag.

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I put it in and lowered it from the neck.

344
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I said, the sun is coming out.

345
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It spread out.

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I put on such a big hat.

347
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Is that funny?

348
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a real story.

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm making it like you.

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm making it like you.

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a real story.

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There are many things in the world.

353
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We have to use them well.

354
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It can't be helped.

355
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The amount of money you've collected and the amount of money you've lost.

356
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Which one is bigger?

357
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Which one is better?

358
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How many have you collected so far?

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

360
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
When I went to school in junior high school.

361
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's right.

362
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I had about 300,000 yen in my pocket.

363
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's like a bag you carry when you go to the cram school.

364
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm a police officer.

365
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's like a businessman.

366
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I see.

367
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's a black leather bag.

368
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
When you go to cram school, you have a long string attached to it.

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You can hold it like this.

370
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes, Mr. Kajibata.

371
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
A bag of money.

372
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Bang!

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's right.

374
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It was falling.

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
When I went to cram school.

376
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What is it?

377
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
When I opened it.

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
When you went to cram school.

379
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's fine.

381
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's fine.

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When I opened it.

383
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
When you opened it.

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's a envelope.

385
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's an envelope.

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What is it?

387
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why are you peeping?

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Why don't you peep?

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Why don't you peep?

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's amazing.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm peeping from above.

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's fine.

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There's cash and coins inside.

394
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I brought the police.

395
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've never really seen anything on the street.

396
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There must be something.

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've never seen a bag of money like this.

398
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Beautiful people get bored in three days.

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But ugly people get used to it in three days.

400
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is that really true?

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Please tell me about that.

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's not that I get used to it.

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's more like I want to see it.

404
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I really like the story of ugly people.

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Dirty things and smelly things.

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It stinks.

407
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But I want you to smell it again.

408
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's true.

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right?

410
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's true.

411
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The ugly woman appears on TV.

412
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think she's ugly.

413
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I change the channel.

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I feel bad.

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I feel bad.

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I change the channel.

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What did you say twice?

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I change the channel.

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I smoke again.

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to see it again.

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I want to see it again.

422
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If it's still on TV...

423
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's still on TV.

424
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's still on TV.

425
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't stop laughing.

426
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can't stop laughing.

427
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's it.

428
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's what I thought.

429
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's right.

430
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't get used to it.

431
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Did you look for someone after that?

432
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did you look for someone after Gorilla Man?

433
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was asked again today.

434
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What is Gorilla Man?

435
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's a boo.

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It was out.

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You didn't look for someone after that?

438
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I was asked again today.

439
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why do people who play sports do that?

440
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a little tough.

441
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The heavens give you two things.

442
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm attracted to it.

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm attracted to it.

444
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm attracted to it.

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm crying.

446
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're crying.

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Sports players are the only ones in the world of manga.

448
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's right.

449
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's impossible for a lady to be a lady.

450
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
She's very good at tennis.

451
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
She's very rich.

452
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
She's very rich.

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
She's a high school student, but she's allowed to do it.

454
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
She's a lot of money.

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's right.

456
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I won't lose to Hiromi.

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He's not going to be there.

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If he was a real sports player, he would be very popular.

459
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I want to look for more.

460
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to look for more.

461
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Please give me a postcard.

462
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Continue to Gorilla Man.

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The pen name is regrettable, but I'm in love with Hitoshi.

464
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm looking for it.

465
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'd like to tell you something interesting today.

466
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is a postcard.

467
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is the title of Go Hiromi's album.

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
First of all, it's called Hiromi's room.

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's good.

470
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And then, it's called Hiromic World.

471
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's funny up to here, but there's a stronger one.

472
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's called Pyramid Hiromid.

473
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's tough.

474
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's a disco called Jubilation in Osaka.

475
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's a disco for Hiromi.

476
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So I made a disco like this.

477
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What should I call Hiromi?

478
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Jubilation.

479
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Which one?

480
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hiromi.

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Look at the menu of Jubilation.

482
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There's a cocktail called Hiromi.

483
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hiromi will blend it and show it at the store.

484
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No, it's Hiromi.

485
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hiromi?

486
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes.

487
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What do you call that cocktail?

488
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Hiromi.

489
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Who is Hiromi?

490
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's Hiromi.

491
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
When you fight, there's a person who makes a joint sound.

492
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is that for?

493
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a dog sound.

494
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's only heard by dogs.

495
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's the same thing as that.

496
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's why it's called Poki Poki.

497
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
With this Poki Poki, it's called Exciting.

498
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Huh?

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Exciting is always...

500
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Where are you looking at while talking?

501
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Exciting is...

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's hard to talk.

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Exciting is everywhere in the city.

504
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What was the name of that cocktail?

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's Hiromi.

506
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Exciting is feeding on the corner.

507
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Listen to what I'm saying.

508
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm telling you so that you can understand.

509
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Come here.

510
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What are you doing?

511
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Poki Poki?

512
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Poki Poki?

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This Poki Poki...

514
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It rides on the wind.

515
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It rides on the wind.

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It reaches Exciting.

517
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Exciting didn't know that.

518
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It was feeding on the corner.

519
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Right?

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
At that time, it heard Poki Poki from somewhere.

521
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It went into Exciting's ear.

522
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Ah!

523
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's calling me!

524
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And then Exciting came running.

525
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And that fight is Exciting.

526
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I see.

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Do you understand?

528
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes.

529
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Wait a minute.

530
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In an exciting situation, there is something called Exciting.

531
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That thing?

532
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's not that thing.

533
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's not that thing.

534
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There is something like Exciting's life.

535
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's a fairy.

536
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Ah...

537
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Is that so?

538
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Huh?

539
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not a human.

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a fairy.

541
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I've seen that Exciting.

542
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's a man with a scar on his cheek.
