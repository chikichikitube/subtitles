1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next, let's watch the final pro-wrestling match of Ritton Mizuno!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight is the last day of Mizuno's solo life.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's watch the match!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's go!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's watch the final match of Ritton Mizuno!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ritton Mizuno

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm already slipping at this stage.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Human nuclear power!

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The power of art is not just nuclear power.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ritton Mizuno, also known as human nuclear power.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Today, Ritton Mizuno is going to have his first solo match in 37 years.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Will he be able to get a wonderful girlfriend and have the best summer in his life?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How old are you now?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm 37 years old.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're 37 years old?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're 37 years old, and you don't have a girlfriend yet, right?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm already slipping at this stage.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're slipping at this stage.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I see.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You have to do your best.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today, we're going to have a pro-wrestling match.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Her name is Hanatabajo.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I see.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's see how much you can appeal to her.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is your first match.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Your opponent is Hanatabajo!

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What kind of beauty is she?

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What?

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wow!

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm so happy!

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've never seen anything like this before.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let me introduce you to her.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Her name is Rei Morikawa.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
She's currently a female pro-wrestler.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She's going to make a lunch box full of love for her husband.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you good at cooking?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, I am.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're good at cooking?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes, I am.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I see.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's great.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's great.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's start with Hanatabajo.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hanatabajo, please give her a present.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All right.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good luck.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Good luck.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Good luck from now on.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Good luck.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's great.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's great.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I want to sleep with you tonight.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's great.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's get started.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you all right?

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's great.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's a real name.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I just thought of a name.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's great.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's great.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's great.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's great.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's great.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's great.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's great.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's great.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's great.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's great.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's great.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's great.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's great.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Good luck.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Personally, I didn't feel

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
like I could sing this song.

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Thank you.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It was great.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
It's you!

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,480
This is not about winning or losing

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I've already said this to her, but how much water can she drink to appeal to her?

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Now, Morikawa Rei-san, please make your judgement

87
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Okay, I'm ready

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
The judgement is...

89
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Please! Please!

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Why? Why?

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,480
I think she did her best, but I like strong people

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,480
That's not true!

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
You're overreacting!

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Please say it again

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
I don't understand anything

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Please do it one more time!

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Now that she's been asked to do it again, let's have her back on the stage

98
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Ningen Genshi-Ryoku Ritton Mizuno is here!

99
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,480
She's back on the stage again!

100
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
That's enough

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Please welcome Yamato Nadeshiko-san and Fuwa Marika-san!

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,480
She's the type of person who always makes me laugh

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
I see

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Is it hard?

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
No, it's not hard

106
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
It's okay, it's okay

107
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Now, please give her a bouquet of flowers

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Let's do our best!

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Thank you

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Let's go eat after the show

111
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Let's go to my restaurant

112
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Please sit at the back

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Let's go, Ritton Mizuno!

115
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Let's see the pro-wrestling match!

116
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
She's here!

117
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
She's here!

118
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Hey, Mizuno, are you okay?

119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Your opponent is Takano!

120
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,480
We will now begin the first match of today's main event, the time limit

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:16,480
In the red corner, the 300 pound fighter, Kenji Takano!

122
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:28,480
In the blue corner, the 140 pound fighter, Ritton Mizuno!

123
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Kenji Takano!

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
It's been 4 or 5 years!

125
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:47,480
It's been 2 or 3 years!

126
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Mizuno!

127
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
It's okay, it's okay

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
It's okay, it's okay

129
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
It's okay, it's okay

130
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Are you going to hit me with all of them?

131
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
It's okay, it's okay

132
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
It's okay, it's okay

133
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Is this a down?

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Yes, it's a down

135
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,480
3, 4

136
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Fight!

137
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
I can't breathe

138
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
I can't breathe

139
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Really?

140
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I can't breathe

141
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
He's wearing a mask

142
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
He's wearing a mask

143
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
He's wearing a mask

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
He's wearing a mask

145
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
It's a down

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I don't need that

147
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Go! Go! Go!

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Go! Go!

149
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Now! Now!

150
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
The top rope!

151
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Go! Go!

152
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Top rope!

153
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
What's wrong?

154
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
It's a fall

155
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
What's the matter?

156
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
From the top rope!

157
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Go! Go! Go!

158
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
He's being surrounded!

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Go! Go! Go!

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
He did it!

161
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
He did it!

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Mizuno!

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Mizuno!

164
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Mizuno!

165
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Mizuno!

166
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I can't do this anymore.

167
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
You can't do this anymore!

168
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
You're dead!

169
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
You're dead!

170
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
You're dead!

171
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
There are a lot of you!

172
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
He's dead!

173
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
He's dead!

174
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
He's dead!

175
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
But!

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
But!

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
But!

178
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
But!

179
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
But!

180
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Please give me a judgement!

181
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
The judgement is...

182
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
This time too, his nuclear power was unexpected.

183
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
I was just looking at him.

184
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:24,480
I was just looking at him.

185
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:40,480
He's a taxi driver.

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Everyone!

187
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Everyone!

188
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm glad that there are a lot of you here.

189
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Actually, I'm seeing this for the first time today.

190
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Now, let me introduce you to everyone.

191
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,480
This is the new Mizuno!

192
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Hey!

193
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Hey!

194
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Hey!

195
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Wait a minute.

196
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Wait a minute.

197
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
What do you want to be?

198
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
I like you a lot.

199
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Really?

200
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Really?

201
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Really?

202
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Really?

203
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
If that's the case, I think I should be with you even though I'm 25 years old.

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
As a stranger, what kind of person do you want me to be?

205
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
First, let's talk about the person who was more popular in the past.

206
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
As a stranger, what kind of person do you want me to be?

207
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Just ignore that!

208
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
No!

209
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Is that person better than me now?

210
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
No!

211
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
That's good, isn't it?

212
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,480
That's because it's a human voice.

213
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
It's really wild.

214
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
To be honest, I thought it would be even weirder.

215
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,480
When I got home, I was just looking at the mirror.

216
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
It's not wild anymore.

217
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,480
When I had hair, it was wild.

218
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Now it looks like a fur.

219
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
No way! It's really cool!

220
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,480
It looks like I'm being bullied.

221
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
I wonder if it's true. If I get hit like this, I think it's really worth it.

222
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,480
But it's not like I'm doing this all the time.

223
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
When I'm doing it normally, your eyes are big.

224
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
It looks like Boku-chan.

225
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
It's not cute anymore.

226
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,480
It's not scary anymore.

227
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
It looks like it has a lot of hair.

228
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Hey!

229
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I really like it.

230
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,480
But the people around me don't like it.

231
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,480
That's true.

232
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
But today, I went into the opening scene.

233
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
I was in a different room.

234
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
It's finally here.

235
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Yuta-san said,

236
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
It's a great voice.

237
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,480
What is it?

238
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I really wanted to see it from afar.

239
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I've been wearing a towel all the time.

240
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
I'm used to it.

241
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm not used to it myself.

242
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm going to the bathroom.

243
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm afraid it's going to come back.

244
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,480
You have to show the back of the deluxe before you show it.

245
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,480
I don't know.

246
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,480
When I'm in the bathroom, I usually forget.

247
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I'm not wearing my own hair.

248
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm sure I can't do it.

249
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll be in a hurry.

250
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Why are you making that sound?

251
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,480
It's like you have an enemy in your head.

252
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,480
I have beautiful hair, so I had no choice but to go like this.

253
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
But I can go like this, right?

254
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
No, it's not like that.

255
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Everyone says it's good, but I want you to say it's better.

256
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
But the shape of the head is good.

257
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It's really good, right?

258
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
The shape of the head is good.

259
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I can't do that, because I'm perfect.

260
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm just easy to hit.

261
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Also, you're a little too burnt.

262
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
What do you mean, too burnt?

263
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
The sun...

264
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Yes, yes, yes.

265
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Your face...

266
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Yes, yes, yes.

267
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
It's even more like that.

268
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
It's like I'm a botamochi.

269
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Botamochi...

270
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
If you're an amateur, you can't do that.

271
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Um...

272
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Are you a botamochi?

273
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Are you a botamochi with a Regula 4 and 5?

274
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,480
You're really cool when you hit.

275
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Cool?

276
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I don't know what kind of person you are.

277
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I don't know your nationality.

278
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
That's why you're mysterious.

279
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Because you're Machan.

280
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
You shouldn't be called Machan.

281
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
You're mysterious.

282
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,480
It's not that you and I admire each other.

283
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
It's called a double pose.

284
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
No, it's not.

285
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Change your name.

286
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
It's called a double baldness.

287
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Baldness?

288
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
How about that?

289
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
It's not good.

290
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
No, it's not.

291
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
The shape of your head is good.

292
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Yes, yes, yes.

293
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
I can't do that.

294
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Is that so?

295
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,480
If you look from the front, your head is like this.

296
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
It's like a spearhead.

297
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
It's like a spearhead.

298
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
This is hard.

299
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
If you look from the side, it's like this.

300
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
The tip is sharp.

301
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
You don't have a baldness.

302
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I don't have a baldness.

303
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Why?

304
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Because...

305
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
It's beautiful.

306
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,480
I was raised with great care.

307
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
It's true.

308
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
It's true.

309
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I was born at 5 o'clock.

310
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,480
I was born at 5 o'clock, so I don't have time to shave.

311
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I don't have a baldness.

312
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
It's beautiful.

313
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Thank you very much.

314
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Thank you very much.

315
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
It's true.

316
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,480
If you look from the front, your hair is like this.

317
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
It's weird.

318
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Yes, yes, yes.

319
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
It's beautiful.

320
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
It's true.

321
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Thank you very much.

322
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Would you like to be my partner?

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who has been watching Hotaru's wedding scene from the North since the last broadcast.

324
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
I see.

325
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who has been watching Hotaru's wedding scene from the North since the last broadcast.

326
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
I see.

327
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,480
The famous song of Masashi Sada.

328
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
It's la la la la la la.

329
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
I see.

330
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,480
There are lyrics, but what kind of lyrics are there?

331
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
This is really new.

332
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Really?

333
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,480
Masashi Sada and So Kuramoto are...

334
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Sada...

335
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Are you stupid?

336
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
It doesn't fit.

337
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
It doesn't fit.

338
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
You're thinking about it, right?

339
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
This...

340
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
No, it's not like that.

341
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
I don't like it that much.

342
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Please tell me.

343
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
What is it?

344
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
What is it?

345
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I'm saying it from the side.

346
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
The lyrics...

347
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Well, it's okay.

348
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
What was it like?

349
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
You know the most.

350
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
It's la la, not aah, right?

351
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
It says la la here, so I'll just say it.

352
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Aaaaah.

353
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
It's a little embarrassing to do this.

354
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Although I can pretend to be asleep.

355
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Okay, Masumoto-san.

356
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Yes.

357
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I'll sing a different song for you.

358
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
What?

359
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Oh, you have one?

360
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Yes, please.

361
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,480
The pure firefly is la la.

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Lala

363
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Jun Hotaru is a la-la

364
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,480
Hokkaido is coming out

365
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Really?

366
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Is the conversation going well?

367
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes

368
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Did I stop it too soon?

369
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Yes you did

370
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm sorry

371
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,480
It's just that, Jun Hotaru is a la-la

372
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
You should show it from here

373
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
This is too much

374
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Yes

375
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Please.

377
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Jun, Otaru, wa-ra-ra

378
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Tanaka, Kunie, ra-ra

379
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Jun and Otaru are called by their nicknames.

380
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Why is your father called Tanaka Kunie?

381
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Don't just call me by my nicknames.

382
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,480
What's your father's role?

383
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
He's the muscle of the year.

384
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
He's the muscle of the year.

385
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
What's Tanaka Kunie's role?

386
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
What?

387
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
I'm going to do it from now on, you idiot.

388
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Don't call me Tanaka Kunie.

389
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm sorry, I couldn't think of Tanaka Kunie's role.

390
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
What was his name?

391
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Gorou.

392
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
It's Gorou.

393
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
It's Gorou.

394
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I don't know if it's Tanaka Kunie.

395
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Are you ready?

396
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Please.

397
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Jun, Otaru, wa-ra-ra

398
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Gorou, ra-ra-ra-ra

399
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Kuramoto,

400
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,480
No matter what I say today, everyone's eyes are on me.

401
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
That's right.

402
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
It's kind of hard to do, isn't it?

403
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,480
When I talk to strangers, I can't look up, so I look down.

404
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
That's how I feel right now.

405
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Wait a minute.

406
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
You're the farthest from strangers.

407
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I prepared a few strangers in front of me.

408
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Today, I'm going to do it with this hairstyle.

409
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Come to the set like that.

410
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Sometimes it's this long.

411
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Kimura Takuya's long hair.

412
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Sometimes I shake my head like this.

413
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I can't grow my hair for the rest of my life.

414
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
If that's the case, I'll think about it.

415
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
If I don't get caught,

416
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I don't know if I'm doing this.

417
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
If I don't remember,

418
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,480
I'll make my head look like this.

419
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Who's going to say what first?

420
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I want you to do that.

421
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Like that ***.

422
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
It's hard!

423
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Strangers are usually nice.

424
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
When I drink alcohol, I don't know what's going on.

425
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I feel like I have to be nice.

426
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I don't forget that it's hard.

427
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
It's going to be okay.

428
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,480
When I went to drink with someone before,

429
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I saw a man next to me.

430
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
He drank a lot of alcohol.

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
He's writing it down with his hand.

432
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,480
He's writing it down with his hand.

433
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,480
He's writing it down with his hand.

434
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I don't want you to know.

435
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Emergency announcement.

436
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,480
The eternal rival, Moriman and Yamazaki, will finally meet at the venue in Tokyo.

437
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Will it be Moriman or Yamazaki?

438
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:17,480
