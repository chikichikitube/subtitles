1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we have a lot of things to do from the top of our heads.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today we have a lot of things we can't let go of.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we have a lot of things we can't let go of.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Have you watched last week's episode?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I actually forgot about it a bit.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I remembered it now.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You remembered it.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You said you'd give 5% in one minute.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What did I do?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To give 5%...

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In one minute?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can go up again.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's fine.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know about this week.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But how did the players do?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's take a look.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you very much.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is that okay?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wato-san.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is one minute.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is one minute?

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is ideal.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is ideal?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you want to go up 5%, you have to go up this much.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ideal?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I thought it was going up.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ideal?

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
5% means that about 2 million people have joined in at this moment.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I understand.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
About 2 million.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
2 million.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's take a look.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please look at the order here.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes, I'll go in order.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's going up here?

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's going up here?

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The postcard.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The postcard.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's going up.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
From here.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's going up.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's going up.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's going up.

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's going up.

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait a minute.

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This one minute.

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's going up.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's going up?

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait a minute.

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's going up is going up, isn't it?

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's going up a little.

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's going up, isn't it?

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How much did it go up?

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
0.6%.

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it's not going down.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Isn't this amazing?

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But it doesn't have anything to do with that.

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is your punishment game.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why?

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm the one who gave you 5%.

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But this is the reason why it went up.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, well, well, well.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right?

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's why I keep saying it.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But it didn't go up to 5%.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was 0.6%.

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now.

80
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you want me to do?

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What do you want me to do?

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because there's nothing left.

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What?

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, no, no.

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't have money.

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't have anything.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You don't have money.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You have a lot of money.

89
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, no, no.

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What is it?

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After all, it's what you said.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
As I said before.

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Did I say it?

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you doing?

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, I'm doing this.

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm doing this, so my abs are okay.

97
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't come suddenly.

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, I'm glad I have this.

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you're a weak man, you'll be in trouble.

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is it?

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Punishment. Punishment. Punishment game.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why is it a punishment game?

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It went up.

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It didn't go up.

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I said I'd give you 5%.

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
5%?

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It can't go up.

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey, hey, hey.

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You started it.

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It took so much time to spend.

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know.

112
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I know, I know.

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, it's okay.

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you doing?

115
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, we talked to the staff.

116
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What did you just say?

117
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The abs thing.

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, the abs thing.

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
For example.

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's also TV shopping.

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's also TV shopping.

122
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know, the strong-looking foreigner is wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt.

123
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's doing it, right?

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That...

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Otaku-san...

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But wait a minute.

127
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is there such a thing on TV? TV shopping?

128
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, there is.

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Really?

130
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Did you do that?

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, I did.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But that's just a video from overseas, right?

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, I can't do it.

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you going to California?

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why?

136
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't do it.

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Where are you going to do it?

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to get a proper studio.

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can do it yourself.

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I recommend it to everyone watching TV.

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I bought it with my own money.

142
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What is this?

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What else is there?

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Also, the revival of Hitoshi and Akiko.

145
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is the season of Akiko's school festival.

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
School festival...

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want you to wait for it.

148
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Recently, my mother...

149
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She's been in a lot of pictures.

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Again?

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And I got a call the other day.

153
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yesterday!

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I got a call yesterday.

155
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hitoshi said, thank you.

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What?

157
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What do you mean, thank you?

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I said that.

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In Osaka, a commercial was decided.

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wait a minute.

161
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What commercial?

162
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Nishin's Yakisoba.

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This old lady has decided to do a commercial.

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know if it's okay.

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I said, did you say okay?

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She said, yes.

167
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I said, thank you.

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What else?

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is amazing.

170
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What is it?

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lotte.

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Lotte is good.

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you know Cool Mint Gum?

174
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, Cool Mint Gum.

175
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everyone, do you know?

176
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That penguin.

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There's a picture of a penguin.

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you think?

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Penguin!

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you a penguin?

182
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The penguin in the gum is you.

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's because I'm delicious.

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't have to do anything.

186
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll take a picture.

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Really?

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Location, the South Pole.

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't care.

190
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's getting cold in this season.

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's finally getting cold.

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why did you have to go to the South Pole in this season?

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I just wanted to take a picture.

194
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How long does it take to get to the South Pole?

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It takes about two or three hours.

196
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What if it takes that long?

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm half way there.

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It doesn't take two or three hours.

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's right.

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It doesn't take that long.

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It doesn't take that long.

202
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why are you so slow?

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's okay.

204
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It takes two or three hours.

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's okay.

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It doesn't take two or three hours.

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The South Pole.

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't care.

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's funny.

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't care.

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you telling me to choose?

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've prepared a lot of things.

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If it's for us, we don't have to go to the South Pole.

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As a guest, I'm a big fan of Machan.

216
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
As a guest, I'm a big fan of Machan.

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait a minute.

218
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't laugh so much.

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can't get rid of the feeling of pity for Machan.

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't get rid of the feeling of pity for Machan.

221
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hama-chan is arrogant.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Machan is more arrogant than Machan.

223
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's okay to be arrogant.

224
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why are you laughing?

225
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let me tell you the story.

226
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
At this point, I have no other opportunity.

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can go to the South Pole.

228
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm the second one.

230
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go to the South Pole.

231
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Which one do you want to choose?

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The South Pole.

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Which one are you going to choose?

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why should I choose?

235
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I've been to the Arabian Sea and the safari.

236
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I want to go to the serpent, but I can't go to New York!

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I want to go to the Indian, but I can't!

238
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you doing there?

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What are you doing there?

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What am I doing?

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What were you doing when I was being punished?

242
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What the hell were you doing when I went to the Indian?

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
When you were in the Indian, I was about to die!

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The schedule...

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's ask the manager.

246
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No, no, no.

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's all messed up.

248
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why is it all messed up?

249
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't know why, but it's all messed up all of a sudden.

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
For now, on Tuesday, it's all messed up.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you want to go to the language school?

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Give me a break.

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, no, no.

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's all messed up.

255
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What the hell?

256
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Did you do something so bad?

257
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The Japanese national team is in a pretty bad state at the World Cup.

258
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's bad, right?

259
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A lot of people are complaining about this and that.

260
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But this is fine.

261
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If Matsumoto does this, the Japanese national team will be able to go to the World Cup.

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I see.

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Please tell us.

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
First of all, I want to say something to all the players.

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I see.

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Everyone is like that.

267
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
After all, Suonome.

268
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Every night.

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
First of all, from there.

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then?

271
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And then?

272
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's like this.

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Please tell us properly.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's go.

275
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know Lopez, right?

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes, yes.

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
His handwriting is strange.

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It has nothing to do with the game.

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's called Lopez.

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What is that?

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What is Pe?

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What is that?

283
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't know.

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think it's better to go to the north.

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's not it.

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's not it.

287
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Is that Pe?

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

289
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There's no Pe?

290
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There wasn't that much?

291
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to look for it.

292
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm desperate.

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, yes, yes.

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Low Armour.

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's Su?

296
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's Su?

297
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Su is this.

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Su of Nasu.

299
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Nasu Kogen.

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Takasuna.

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right.

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right.

303
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That was good.

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Pe.

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There was no Pe.

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There's a word called Pe, but I don't think this is it.

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know, so I'm going to go with Pe.

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Lopez.

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Lopez.

310
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What is that?

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Sabu.

312
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Recently, there is a tendency to use harsh words to patients in Japan and America.

313
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes, yes, yes.

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't think the doctor will be able to say it well in front of the patient.

315
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thinking about the patient.

316
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What kind of announcement should I make to prevent injury?

317
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I see.

318
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is really.

319
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This program has finally hit the wall of the funeral.

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Speak quietly.

321
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't write it.

322
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm busy too.

323
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
After all, it's a shocking thing.

324
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But you have to say it.

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
One person has to say it to one person.

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I wonder if the doctor will say it too.

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
After all, under the word, there is a word called Noshi.

329
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm talking about whether people live or die.

330
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you a cancer or Noshi?

331
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're going to be beaten to death.

332
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't say the same thing twice.

334
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I see.

335
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Liar.

336
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Liar.

337
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Liar.

338
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
OK, OK.

339
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Are you ready?

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
After all, what makes people anxious?

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It comes from loneliness.

342
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Anxiety.

343
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll get rid of this loneliness.

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Loneliness?

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's not just about cancer.

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can say it about everything.

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Before you say it, say something painful to the other person.

348
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
For example, it doesn't matter if it's a sideburn.

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It doesn't matter.

350
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Before you say something to the other person.

351
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's the same for me.

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know if that's a good thing.

353
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's good, isn't it?

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Is it good?

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But it's a complete lie.

357
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Even if you think it's a lie, it doesn't make you happy.

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I see.

359
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Right?

360
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No matter how kind he is, he can't get angry.

361
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's my sideburn that's bad.

362
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I think so.

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's where it goes.

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I think that's why doctors should be like that.

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I see.

366
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm not like that either.

367
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're a cancer.

368
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Or you'll laugh.

369
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's not good.

370
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's not good.

371
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's not good for me.

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't understand.

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's not good.

374
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I told you it's bad.

375
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
