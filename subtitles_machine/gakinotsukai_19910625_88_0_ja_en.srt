1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm not a kid, so I'm Yamazaki Otaku Omon Prank Camera!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, you've seen Yamazaki-kun.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've seen him.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Actually, it's his second time.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's trick him.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm a little worried if I'm going to say something good.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What are we going to do today?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, to the people who set it up.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Please come in.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
First of all, I've been doing terrible things on Telekura before.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the past, I played the role of being deceived.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm Takasu-kun of Telekura.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Please come in.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Actually, today, Takasu-kun asked me to lend him a room.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yamazaki-kun's room.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He asked me to lend him a room.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He asked me to stay with his girlfriend.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, his girlfriend was this woman.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yamazaki-kun came back and this appeared there.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've been a Yankee for a long time.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was very strong.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You say a lot.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in the class of the boss.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm in the class of the boss.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're a small boss, aren't you?

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm a small boss.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Was I really the boss?

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, let's prank him.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
First of all, please come in as his girlfriend.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's your name?

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Asaki Misato.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Misato-san.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Actually, Takasu-kun is called Yamazaki.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
To her.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
To borrow a room.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's better to call her Yamazaki.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's my room.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
To her.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I'm Yamazaki.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yamazaki-kun came back while I was in the warehouse.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And she's gone.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then this man will appear.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Please come in.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No matter how you look at it, you don't look like an elementary school student.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm Murakami-san, who introduced the villain.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm Misato-chan.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When I was told that I couldn't do anything to my Misato,

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I wondered if Yamazaki would blow out the panchowkaze.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm still in a good mood.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He's here.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Run.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's cold.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm fine.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm fine.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm going camping.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yamazaki-san, what are you doing?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Nothing.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go, go, go.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't move.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't move.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't move.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't move.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't move.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't move.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hello.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Is Yamazaki there?

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hello.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hello.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is Yamazaki there?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's me.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's me?

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Misato.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll kick you out.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Misato?

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't mess with me.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hey.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Who is Misato?

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't talk to me like that.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't think about it.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hey.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Say something.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Say something.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wait a minute.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll be there soon.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait a minute.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Who are you?

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wait a minute.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Murakami.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Wait a minute.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Come here.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll wait for you.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hey.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Say something.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Say something.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Say something.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who is Misato?

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This?

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I just got a call.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
From Murakami.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll be there soon.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Say something.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What is it?

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll wait for you.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No way.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll wait for you.

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
My voice is shaking.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No way.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't stand it.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What did you say?

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just got a call.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll be there soon.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey.

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What is it?

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I just got a call.

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Misato.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Misato?

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who is it?

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't lie to me.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Murakami.

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll be there soon.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is she a Yakuza woman?

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is she a Yakuza woman?

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is the worst.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll be there soon.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll be there soon.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is it?

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's like this.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hello?

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm in Yamazaki.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you Yamazaki?

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, I'm in Takasu.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Get out of here.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yamazaki?

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you mean?

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll be there soon.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wait for me.

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll be there soon.

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wait for me.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll be there soon.

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yamazaki is somewhere else.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What is it?

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm scared.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm in trouble.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know the number.

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know the number.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
By phone?

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't know the number by phone.

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm scared.

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's okay.

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm scared.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know the number by phone.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm here.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you going to do?

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll ask.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who is it?

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Who is it?

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's me.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll go from there.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Are you going to run away?

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let go of me.

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't run away.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't run away.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Excuse me.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm Yamazaki.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What are you?

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm Yamazaki.

185
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yamazaki is over here.

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm Yamazaki.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not Yamazaki.

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm not.

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm not.

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You need to spend more time in your home.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I have my brother with me.

201
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not Yamazaki.

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm not Yamazaki.

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's the leader.

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My brother's not alive.

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not Yamazaki.

208
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hello.

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let me go.

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ouch!

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ouch!

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ouch!

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry!

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ouch!

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ouch!

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ouch!

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Ouch!

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ouch!

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hello, I'm Murakami.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ouch!

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ouch!

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Ouch!

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry!

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I thought I was going to die.

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's get out of here.

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's get out of here.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
When I called you, you said you were fine.

228
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're really bad at this.

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yamada, let me introduce you.

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He's a villain.

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I did it at any time.

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I did it at any time.

233
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're crying.

234
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm about to cry.

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was deceived again.

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm gonna cry.

237
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm gonna cry.

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm gonna grind my teeth.

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will do what I can.

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going to run.

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll talk to you later.

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Please wait a minute.

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You've beenаний.

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
enough

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Stop it!

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You've been khácly!

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ladies and Gentlemen

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hello!

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's have a good time today.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Although I'm a little bit tired.

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's talk a little bit and go home.

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Talk a little bit and go home.

253
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've been saying this for a long time, but I can't reach your hands anymore.

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've been saying that I'm a star.

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But in the end, I'm just a twinkle little star.

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What are you talking about?

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What's a twinkle little star?

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm just a little star.

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not that big of a star.

260
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But...

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hey, wait a minute.

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why are you talking while looking at me?

264
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But we're three times bigger than you think we are.

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Is that what you wanted to say?

266
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's right.

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The next one?

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's right.

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There's one in Yoshimoto Kogyo.

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, specifically, there are two.

271
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The medal has arrived.

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The medal has arrived.

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Masamotoshi Toshi, Hamada Masatoshi.

274
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I wrote it down.

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I wrote it down.

276
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Who sent it?

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I took a quick look.

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I took a quick look.

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Kaifu Toshiki

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The Prime Minister of Japan.

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What does this mean?

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is us.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We are the people of Takane no Hana.

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's just saying it.

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, next up is the Prime Minister.

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's a confederation with a culture person.

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A confederation.

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Miyazawa Rie was here last year, wasn't she?

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right.

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Next time.

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We're next to Kaifu-chan.

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, really.

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He wants to touch our skin, doesn't he?

294
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He wants to...

295
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He wants to grab this fortune.

296
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's what he thought.

297
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, I understand how he feels.

298
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's right.

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is us.

300
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, there are people who can't go.

301
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, this is us.

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's go.

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Right?

304
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
By all means.

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's go by all means.

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What should we wear?

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right?

308
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
By all means, we'll go to a place like that.

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It says, please come to the confederation in your daily clothes.

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But to be honest, there's no one who dresses up like that.

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
T-shirts and jeans.

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's a bit rude.

313
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So, we'll go in matching party dresses.

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're wearing a party dress.

315
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And matching.

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're opening your chest a bit boldly.

317
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Wearing a flower.

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Wearing a net.

320
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think there was a misfortune.

321
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like this.

322
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know if I can talk to them.

323
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know who they are.

324
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Who are these two?

325
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But I'll talk to them in order.

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't think it's about who they are.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Prime Minister.

329
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
When we went before,

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Who are these two?

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Why do you want to talk to them?

332
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How are you doing recently?

333
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's all you can say.

334
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's all you can say.

335
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How are you doing recently?

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can only say something abstract.

337
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't say anything.

338
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What should we do at that time?

339
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know if we should be serious.

340
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's fine as usual, isn't it?

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's up to you.

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When we went before,

343
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What do you think of the song?

344
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe if you do that,

345
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The SP will come and say,

346
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes, wait a minute.

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No way.

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There's a guy like this next to the Prime Minister.

349
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
People will think you're crazy.

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Foreign exile.

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's not that far.

352
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But I wonder how far you'll go.

353
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'd like to hear something about Nepal Pearl.

354
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If you make a suspicious move,

355
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The SP will make a mysterious move.

356
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When it goes like this,

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
People will think you're crazy.

358
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
When the hand goes like this,

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When it goes like this,

360
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're a karate master.

361
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I think you're going to do something.

362
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't want it to be like this.

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You have to keep it tight.

364
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For the time being,

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Just do something.

366
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Make a strange face.

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Is that allowed?

368
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's about it.

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
When I pass by,

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll make a normal face.

371
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where do you do your makeup?

372
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If there's a pencil,

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm a magician.

374
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can do anything.

375
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

376
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I can be a strong tiger.

377
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You don't look like a tiger.

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I can be a dog or anything.

379
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Do it properly.

380
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll stand up with my face.

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you going to do when I do that?

382
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's keep a distance.

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why don't you do it with me?

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Why?

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want to be dragged.

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's wear a costume.

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What kind of costume?

388
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know.

389
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When I saw the costume,

390
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I thought you were laughing.

391
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's write Down Town on the T-shirt.

392
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's not B&B.

393
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why?

394
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I used to wear B&B.

395
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I used to wear a T-shirt with Pionkichi's picture on it.

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You?

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes.

398
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You should wear that.

399
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
With Pionkichi's picture on it?

400
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

401
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's just a shirt.

402
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's a running shirt.

403
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's not naked.

404
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think I can do it.

405
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Or you can dress up as a TV character.

406
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What do you have now?

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What do you have now?

408
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Something that has an impact.

409
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is it Hideki?

410
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But if it's Hideki,

411
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
people will think it's really Hideki.

412
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
People will think it's really Hideki.

413
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hello.

414
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Hello.

415
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hello.

416
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This person is...

417
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mr. Yamada.

418
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a very ordinary name.

419
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's nothing.

420
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If it's Yamada Mari,

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
there are probably tens of thousands of people in Japan right now.

422
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There are?

423
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Mr. Yamada is at the venue today.

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is he here?

425
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes.

426
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hey!

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're a man no matter where you're from.

428
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yamada Mari is the only one who says,

429
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
shut up to you.

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Thank you very much.

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Thank you very much.

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Now...

433
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What?

434
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's move on to the postcards.

435
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's move on to the postcards.

436
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm a very cute middle school girl.

437
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
By the way,

438
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
have you ever thought that Machan and Amachan are so scary that you could die?

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
When I was in elementary school,

440
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was waiting for my friends in front of the school gate.

441
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A strange old man came up to me and pointed at the poster on the wall.

442
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He said,

443
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
this is me.

444
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So I looked at it half-heartedly.

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I was surprised again.

446
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
As the old man said,

447
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
this old man was a criminal who was on the verge of death.

448
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The old man laughed at me.

449
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was so scared that I had no choice but to run and run and run back home.

450
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is scary.

451
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I wonder if he really did that.

452
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is such a guy walking around?

453
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
In front of the school gate?

454
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There are really many things.

455
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You know,

456
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
a long time ago,

457
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I told you about my brother.

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He was running in a single car in the middle of the night.

459
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Then,

460
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the old man was covered in blood and was lying down.

461
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I stopped the single car and asked him what happened.

462
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He was in a state where he couldn't speak.

463
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He was covered in blood.

464
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He was covered in blood.

465
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He was spitting blood out of his mouth.

466
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I wish I had left him alone.

467
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's not a good thing.

468
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But you can't just leave him alone.

469
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What's wrong with you going that far?

470
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's not true.

471
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you go that far, you'll be fine.

472
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I felt sorry for him.

473
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I went to the pharmacy.

474
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I bought disinfectant and gauze.

475
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I went back to the pharmacy.

476
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The old man was covered in blood.

477
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I wish I had left him alone.

478
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Someone called the police.

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The police came.

480
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What happened?

481
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
When I told him about my brother,

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the blood-soaked old man suddenly stood up

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and pointed at my brother.

484
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He said,

485
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He did it!

486
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
My brother was in a state of shock.

487
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I can't believe it.

488
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's love-sody.

489
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
His eyes were like this.

490
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
His nose was like this.

491
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think you should help people.

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Help people.

493
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Can you do emergency treatment?

494
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
For example, if you have blood coming out of your nose.

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes, I can.

496
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I've said this before,

497
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
but I've never fixed my gauze.

498
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Really?

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When?

500
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Two years ago.

501
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why did you cut it?

502
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why did you cut it?

503
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why did you cut here?

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because it hurt.

505
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It hurt? Okay.

506
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why did you cut it?

507
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I cut it.

508
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You cut it?

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Pull out the gauze.

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What are you going to do?

511
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What?

512
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How do you fix your gauze?

513
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What?

514
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Pull out the gauze.

515
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I pulled out the gauze and cut it.

516
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why?

517
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Why did you cut here?

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why?

519
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If you do this, it will stick.

520
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You don't know anything.

521
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you cut it like this, it will stick.

522
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's cut it.

523
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

524
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Let's cut it.

525
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's okay.

526
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I got it.

527
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Wait a minute.

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's okay.

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It hurts.

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's okay.

531
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What?

532
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's okay, but I'll sue you.

533
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You should sue me.

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I don't like it because you cut it.

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I want to see it.

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What do you want to see?

537
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How long does it take to stick?

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Two and a half minutes.

539
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Let's go home.

540
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's enough.

541
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I can't decide when to go home.

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm always surprised when I go home.

543
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay, it's over.

544
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's clean up over there.

545
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's put it all in the back.

546
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Put it in and take out the bean ball.

547
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Shogun, turn off the light.

548
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Turn off the light.

549
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's too hot to touch the bean ball.

550
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's go home.

551
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's clean up the microphone, too.

552
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
We have to get rid of the fire.

553
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Let's get rid of the fire.

554
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay, it's over.

555
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Thank you for your hard work.

556
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Turn around.

557
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Who are you talking to?

558
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hello.

559
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Today's opening is interesting.

560
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Today's opening is interesting.

561
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's the best.

562
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What are you going to do with the pranks from now on?

563
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What do people do?

564
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What kind of prank would you like to try next time?

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What kind of prank would you like to try next time?

566
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I want to try something I think I don't know.

567
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I want to try something I don't know.

568
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I want to change it to a soft temperature meter that I have.

569
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
A stopwatch?

570
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It will take time to notice.

571
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And the ending.

572
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
As I said today, the way to go home.

573
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I always hear people say,

574
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm going home.

575
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
If you say,

576
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm going home.

577
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's think about this.

578
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The most ideal is when you go home.

579
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
From the top,

580
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
How do you say it?

581
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The stars in the sky are falling.

582
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We'll get on there.

583
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Get on and go home.

584
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No matter where you go home.

585
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If you can do that,

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You can go home cleanly.

587
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's right.

588
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The two of us will become stars.

589
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Because I'm a star.

590
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Because I'm a star.

591
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm going home.

592
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, if that's the case,

593
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll ask for it.

594
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What kind of movie do you want to watch?

595
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm looking forward to it.

596
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll do my best until next week.

597
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you.
