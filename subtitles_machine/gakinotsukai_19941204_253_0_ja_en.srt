1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For example, as a man, if you only show your face, you'll get 30 points.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You think you'll get 30 points, but you'll still get 50 points, right?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's what makes you angry!

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You said you'd get 30 points.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've seen the players, but they're still low.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Everyone's bad.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you think, Tabas?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think Yotsukato-san and Hatsumoto are better.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you get 30 points, you'll get 55 points.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why can't I get 30 points?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's about 30.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's the basics.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If I don't get 20 points, I'll get 30 points.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's sad.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is 20 points okay?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
20 points is hard.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's pretty hard.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can go, right?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But who's going to play with me?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't get angry.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't get angry.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you get angry because of that, you'll be an adult.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What do you think?

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think Hama-chan is better.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You think Hama-chan is better than me?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you think?

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There are various opinions.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What do you think?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think Matsumoto-san will get 30 points.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you sure?

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Matsumoto-san is better.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't look down on me.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think so.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What do you think?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The program was interesting.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think it's a good thing.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is that so?

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you think I'm bad?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't think you're bad, but you're not an adult.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think you're a bad person.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't like you at all.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't think you're bad.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think you're a bad person.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think Matsumoto-san will get 30 points.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think Matsumoto-san will get 30 points.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think Matsumoto-san is better.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think Matsumoto-san will get 30 points.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think Matsumoto-san is better.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think Hama-chan is better.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think Matsumoto-san is better.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you think?

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do you think?

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't have a boyfriend?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why do you have to do that?

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You have to be calm.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why do you have to do that?

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why do you have to do that?

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I have a bad feeling about that.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okamoto, you are in the nose.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okamoto, you are a farmer's grandmother.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Suzuki, which side are you in?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've been watching you since I saw you.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okamoto, you are a farmer's grandmother.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm angry.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You are a farmer's grandmother.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You are a farmer's grandmother.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You are a farmer's grandmother.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are a farmer's grandmother.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't say the same thing.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't hear you.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You think it will be fun?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't say anything.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I know why...

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,220
They don't get benefits of course.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Alright...

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,660
Come here girl.

85
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Hold on Motoyachi and Takasu are the worst.

86
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Motoi-Chan is very funny.

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm sorry, but as a producer...

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I'll have to close this.

89
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I'll go home.

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
What are you doing?

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,920
That's right, Tsukasa-san.

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
You don't say anything funny, so I'm going to...

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Shut up!

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
You're fighting, aren't you?

95
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Who are you, a producer?

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
You're going home.

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Shut up!

98
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Hey, hey, hey.

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Shut up!

100
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
But if you think about it...

101
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm still pretty manly, aren't I?

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I'll think about it.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Let's go eat.

104
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
That's right, everyone.

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:49,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Don't fall, don't fall.

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,920
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Ladies and gentlemen.

110
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Um... I overslept.

111
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
You overslept?

112
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I overslept.

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Oh, really?

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
I slept at 5 in the morning.

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,920
When I woke up, it was 5 o'clock.

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I didn't wake up once.

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Doesn't your head hurt?

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
No, it hurts a little.

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Right?

120
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I didn't wake up for 10 hours.

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Oh, right.

122
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,920
I woke up because the prince kissed me.

123
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Where?

124
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Oh, really.

125
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I woke up because it was 5 o'clock in the morning.

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I told you so many times.

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
I can't sleep like that.

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
No, no.

129
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
There's a reason for this.

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
I thought I'd go home after work yesterday.

131
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,920
I was about to turn off my cell phone.

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
It was the moment I was about to turn it off.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
I see.

134
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I said yes.

135
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,920
You're from Matsumoto, aren't you?

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I said, I'm definitely from Yakuza.

137
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
You're from Koi, aren't you?

138
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I said, I'm definitely from Yakuza.

139
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
I saw that.

140
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I said, what's that?

141
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,920
You were imitating me.

142
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm from Wada Akiyo.

143
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
You're from Wada Akiyo?

144
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
That's right.

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
That's right.

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Oh, really?

147
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Hey, come over here.

148
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You're quite drunk.

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I was almost finished.

150
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,920
You were imitating Ako-san.

151
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
During the showdown.

152
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I thought he was a muscle man.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
He was...

154
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
He was...

155
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
He was like this.

156
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
He was like this.

157
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
He was like this.

158
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
He was like this.

159
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
He was like this.

160
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
He was like this.

161
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
He was like this.

162
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,920
He is doing something incredible.

163
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Come here.

164
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,920
You're like an old man.

165
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Come here.

166
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
He was in a good mood.

167
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,920
You're really doing this kind of stuff.

168
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
One thing that's bothering me is...

169
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Why are you fighting with your rival, Koji Matoba?

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I was很 close to him.

171
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Yes.

172
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Yes.

173
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Why are you fighting with Koji Matoba?

174
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,920
I said, I don't know what you mean by that, but can you tell me?

175
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Oh, there you go.

176
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I said, I don't know what you mean by that, but can you tell me?

177
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I gave him a character that seemed to have a lot of guts.

178
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
And he said, why me?

179
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Akiyo doesn't know.

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
If that's the case, then there must be many more like Eikichi Yaza.

181
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
He's talking, but he's saying things about the earth.

182
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
He's got a good sense of humor.

183
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I don't know what you mean by that, but can you tell me?

184
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
I said, I don't know what you mean by that, but can you tell me?

185
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm acting like a fool.

186
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm scared.

187
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
You were amazing.

188
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
What kind of tone is that?

189
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
You were on TV before, right?

190
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I asked some ladies.

191
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Who do you think is the most likely to lose?

192
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I happened to be watching that.

193
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I was watching that, and I was laughing.

194
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
I was laughing too.

195
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
What's so funny?

196
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
I cried watching that.

197
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I was acting like a fool.

198
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I was like, oh, I see.

199
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
You were acting like a drunk.

200
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,920
You were acting like a drunk.

201
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm scared.

202
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Who do you think is the most likely to lose?

203
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I said that before.

204
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
What did you say?

205
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I said that before.

206
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
You said that.

207
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I said that.

208
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
I can't say that.

209
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,920
You're acting like a salaryman.

210
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
You're acting like a salesman.

211
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I said that.

212
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I said, it would be fun if I had one.

213
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I said, this is just a bet.

214
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I said, if I had one, it would be pretty big.

215
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Then...

216
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Okay, let's go home today.

217
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
What was that?

218
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
I wanted to make a decision.

219
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
You wanted to make a decision.

220
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
A decision to go home.

221
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I came to the store.

222
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I said, thank you very much for today.

223
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
I came to the store.

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
I was like this.

225
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I said, that's right.

226
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I said, that's right.

227
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I said, that's right.

228
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I said, that's right.

229
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
That's amazing.

230
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
When I did this, I looked like this.

231
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
I didn't like it.

232
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
What?

233
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
I said, that's right.

234
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
I said, that's right.

235
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
I said, that's right.

236
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
I said, that's right.

237
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
I said, that's right.

238
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I said, that's right.

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
But it's okay.

240
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
It's better to say it.

241
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
The manager is a good person.

242
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
He always has a chain.

243
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Mentally.

244
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
He doesn't really have a chain.

245
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
But he has a chain.

246
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
He has a chain.

247
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I was alone yesterday.

248
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I didn't know I had a chain.

249
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I was dragged.

250
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
I was screaming.

251
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
I was screaming.

252
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
I was about to go up the building.

253
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm a real monster.

254
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I'm a real monster.

255
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
But it's okay.

256
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm a senior.

257
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
And...

258
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm sorry to say this.

259
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I'm sorry to say this.

260
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm sorry to say this.

261
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I don't want to do it.

262
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't want to do it.

263
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
But this season is coming.

264
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
But this season is coming.

265
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I'm going to sing.

266
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Which one?

267
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
It's been a long time.

268
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
It's been a long time.

269
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
I have to do a showdown.

270
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
I have to do a showdown.

271
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Come on.

272
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Come on.

273
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
We're going to do it on Kōhaku.

274
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
We're going to do it on Kōhaku.

275
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Kōhaku, red or white?

276
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Kōhaku, red or white?

277
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
We're doing a Kōhaku program on TV.

278
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
We're doing a Kōhaku program on TV.

279
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
We can watch TV together.

280
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Is that so?

281
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
When Kōhaku is off from work,

282
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
We watch Kōhaku together.

283
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
We watch together.

284
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
We're going to watch it in the studio.

285
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
That's good.

286
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
And then, when we decide whether the red is white or not, I always say something like,

287
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
You decide.

288
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
You decide whether it's white or red.

289
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
You're playing rock-paper-scissors, aren't you?

290
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Rock-paper-scissors is unfair.

291
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Why?

292
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,920
And this time, we have to decide whether the red is white or red before that.

293
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Why do you say that twice?

294
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
And this time...

295
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
No, no, no.

296
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
What do you think?

297
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Can't you just run?

298
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
What?

299
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Run?

300
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
What do you mean, run?

301
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
100 meters.

302
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,920
And then, the winner gets to decide who gets the right?

303
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
You can't blame the staff here.

304
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm not blaming them.

305
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Really.

306
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,920
You run 100 meters, and the winner decides.

307
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
The worst thing is, even though you won at 100 meters,

308
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
the worst thing is if the red is white.

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
That's the worst.

310
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
That's the worst, too.

311
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
See?

312
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Then, there's nothing left for you to eat.

313
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
No, it's not like that.

314
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
If I play rock-paper-scissors, it's easier to decide.

315
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm confident that you'll win at 100 meters.

316
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I can win.

317
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
I can win enough.

318
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
What did you say?

319
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I can win easily.

320
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,920
100 meters.

321
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
How fast can you run?

322
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I don't know.

323
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
How fast can you run at 50 meters?

324
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I think I can run at 7 meters.

325
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
And then, the winner gets to decide who gets the right?

326
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Well, that's...

327
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Why?

328
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,920
I can't talk anymore.

329
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Really?

330
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
It's really fast.

331
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
How fast can you run?

332
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,920
How fast can you run?

333
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,920
It's there.

334
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
It's there.

335
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I went to the emergency exit.

336
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
It's there.

337
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
You went and came back.

338
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
I went and came back.

339
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Then, go again.

340
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
If you have it, you'll go.

341
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Why?

342
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
If you have it, you'll go.

343
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Why?

344
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,920
If you have it, you'll go.

345
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
If you have it, you'll go.

346
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
It's there.

347
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
I don't have it because I have it.

348
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
It's here.

351
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I said it twice.

352
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I said it twice.

353
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
I let you win.

354
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
It's really fast.

355
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
How many seconds?

356
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
I think it's really...

357
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Really?

358
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I think it's really 11 or 12 seconds.

359
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
No, no, no.

360
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
I can't stop it.

361
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
I can't stop it.

362
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
What are you talking about?

363
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
What can't you stop?

364
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I can't stop it because it's fast.

365
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Your words are funny.

366
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
If you have a member, you'll know.

367
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,920
I'll know if I win.

368
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,920
While you're talking like that, I may be in the Geisha Girls.

369
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
That's not good.

370
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
What will you do if you win?

371
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
I don't think I'll win.

372
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
I don't like it.

373
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I hate it.

374
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
I hate it.

375
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I hate it.

376
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
I hate it.

377
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
I hate it.

378
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
I hate it.

379
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I hate it.

380
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
I don't like it.

381
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
I hate it.

382
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
I hate it.

383
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
I hate it.

384
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
I hate it.

385
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I hate it.

386
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,920
I didn't really go to swimming competitions.

387
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Why?

388
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,920
When the kibasen started, I went to the toilet a lot.

389
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Because your father was going out?

390
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Yes, because my father was going out.

391
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I was looking at my mother in a really bad way.

392
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I don't know what kind of face I should make.

393
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I don't know what kind of face I should make.

394
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,920
When the kibasen started, I was looking at my mother in a really bad way.

395
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
I don't really care about that.

396
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,920
I really don't care about that.

397
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I don't care about the drama.

398
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I don't care about the love scene.

399
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I don't care about the bed scene.

400
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I don't care about that.

401
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,920
When the kibasen started, I was looking at my mother in a really bad way.

402
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I don't care about that.

403
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I can watch that.

404
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
When the kibasen started, I was looking at my mother in a really bad way.

405
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,920
You said it was funny, but when you started watching it, it was very funny.

406
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
You are making fun of me.

407
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I don't make fun of you.

408
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
I don't like the bed scene.

409
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
You know, the bed scenes.

410
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
That's a little tough.

411
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
That's tough.

412
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,920
It's so hard to watch the bed scenes on TV.

413
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,920
It was really hard for me to watch the bed scenes of my father and mother.

414
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,920
You can't do anything about that.

415
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
You can't do anything about that.

416
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,920
You can't say, stop it today.

417
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
To your father and mother.

418
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
You can't do anything about that.

419
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,920
So you try not to get caught on TV, right?

420
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Yes, I do.

421
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I can't help but watch them.

422
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Yes, you just watch them.

423
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,920
You can't say, stop it today.

424
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Stop!

425
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I just know your mother.

426
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,920
You can't say, stop it today.

427
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I'm wearing a fur coat outside!

428
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,920
At the end of the year, Japanese people are the ones who want to go overseas.

429
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Where are you going this year, Matsumoto-san?

430
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,920
You're not going anywhere?

431
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,920
You always say, you're not going anywhere in the New Year.

432
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I don't understand why you think that way.

433
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Why?

434
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I mean, I'm already in Japan!

435
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,920
You're in Japan, too.

436
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,920
I'm speaking with my senses.

437
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I'm speaking with my soul.

438
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
With your soul?

439
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm speaking with my soul.

440
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Why Osaka dialect?

441
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I'm speaking with my soul.

442
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Where are you originally from?

443
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm originally from the closest island to heaven.

444
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Where?

445
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Papua New Guinea.

446
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
New Caledonia?

447
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Papua New Guinea?

448
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,920
You don't even know your own country!

449
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,920
It's Papua New Guinea.

450
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Papua New Guinea.

451
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
It's Papua New Guinea!

452
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
It's New Caledonia.

453
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Oh, I see.

454
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
That's why it's Papua New Guinea.

455
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
That's why it's telecom.

456
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
That's why it's Papua New Guinea.

457
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Papua New Guinea is no good.

458
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
You sound like a real Japanese.

459
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Who are you talking to?

460
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Who are you talking to?

461
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Are you talking to me?

462
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
No, no.

463
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I have a question.

464
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,920
What is the X mark of shiitake mushroom for?

465
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,920
It's to make it easier for the soup to soak in.

466
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
What?

467
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Why do you only use shiitake mushrooms?

468
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Why don't you use carrots or Chinese cabbage?

469
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Chinese cabbage doesn't die in one shot.

470
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It dies in one shot?

471
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
That's amazing.

472
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
That's amazing.

473
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,920
How many shiitake mushrooms do you have in total?

474
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Why?

475
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Why do you have a X mark?

476
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
It's already in there.

477
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
It's not in there.

478
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,920
It's just that there are shiitake mushrooms that aren't in there.

479
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
There aren't any.

480
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
No, no.

481
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I'm serious.

482
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm serious.

483
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
There aren't any.

484
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
I'm not joking.

485
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
I'm not joking.

486
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
When?

487
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
When did you say that?

488
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm sorry.

489
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
I'm serious.

493
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,920
I can't laugh at your attitude right now.

495
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I'm serious.

496
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,920
I'm sorry.

497
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
That's it.

498
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
That's it.

499
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm serious.

500
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
No, no. Don't worry about it.

501
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
I watch the Invention Army every week.

502
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Thank you.

503
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I always think about this.

504
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Why do you always close your eyes when you announce the results?

505
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,920
No way.

506
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Why did you say that?

507
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,920
I don't close my eyes.

508
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
No, no.

509
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Put your hand in your pocket.

510
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Announce the results.

511
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Your voice isn't the atmosphere.

512
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Say it in the atmosphere.

513
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Announce the results.

514
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,920
You always close your eyes when you announce the results.

515
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
You don't know even though you don't watch me.

516
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,920
I always watch you.

517
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Don't worry about it.

518
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm not worried.

519
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
I'm worried.

520
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
You have a bad attitude.

521
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,920
You always announce the results.

522
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,920
You always close your eyes when you announce the results.

523
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:13,920
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
