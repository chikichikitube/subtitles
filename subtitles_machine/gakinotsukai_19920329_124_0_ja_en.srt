1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
After this, it's time for the last episode of Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai Arai-hende.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first episode of Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai Arai-hende will be broadcasted monthly by one person!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, on the 11th of April, on Saturday, there will be a special edition called Downtown Special.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From now on, the staff, including us, will do the promotion for this program.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The loser will go to the Zoom and do the promotion.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Will you be able to get involved?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, that's my own power.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I understand.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can't take care of it until then, so I'll go and do it somehow.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll do this promotion somehow.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like this.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I see.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Actually, there's one more person who hasn't come yet.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Motohichi Adachi hasn't come yet.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He said he'd start at 5.30, so I thought it would be helpful if he moved.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's why he hasn't come yet.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Motohichi has already been decided.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can do it in a pack.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you lose now...

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll do it.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just one, okay?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How many sheets are there? I don't know.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Three or four.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is that so?

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Everyone should have come to me to get four sheets from the beginning.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why am I like this?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know what to do.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't help it.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm selling quite a bit.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, that's mine.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But there are still two sheets left.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you do one pack with three sheets, it's 5,000 yen.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is Tsutsun.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's Tsutsun.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why didn't you say anything during the show?

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who do you want me to show it to?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's Tsutsun.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you want me to show it to anyone?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't want you to know, but it's Tsutsun.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't say it.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Excuse me.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's so close.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm laughing, but I don't know if it's a little higher.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's a little higher.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Who is it from?

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I'll go from here.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's so close.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have a really bad pattern.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It fell.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I have a really bad pattern.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have a really bad pattern.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay. It's okay.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What?

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's over. It's over.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's over. It's over.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's over.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't have any.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's increasing. It's increasing.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Seriously.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You don't have anything I want at all.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is always like this.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I think I have ten of these.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing?

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can't do it. I can't do it with two.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This was there. You took it.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's over.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's over.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Even if I take it, even if I can't take it, I won't put it on my face.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is the secret of downtown.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If you get caught with this, there will be a problem.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There will be a problem.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Nitta, who's behind you?

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You read it yesterday, didn't you?

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's okay.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's just increasing.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When the next one is over.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's over.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a tie.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is Sangamon-chan.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sangamon-chan.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's still light.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's bet your life.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, this is it.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Congratulations.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's sad.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But it's not just a child.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a pack.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
On Friday the 10th, at 7 o'clock in the morning.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's go to the night game.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hold this firmly.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's okay.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Please forgive me for the strange school.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But what should I do?

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because it's a girl.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't let you do that embarrassing thing.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a full body.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's cold, but it's high.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's high.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The tension is high.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Maybe it's the coldest day of the year.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's really cold.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
These guys were waiting in there.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's really good.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
On a day like this.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Such a public program.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's better not to do it.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
After all, the tension of the audience is low.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But it's a fool, so it's high.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a fool, so it's high.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The audience who comes here is a fool.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not a fool.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know who comes here.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm fine, so when I'm talking, the tension is low.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There are times when I don't go home at all.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The audience here and the weather in the mountains are different.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't know.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It changes from time to time.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Have you ever been angry recently?

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What?

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Have you ever been angry?

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Have you ever been angry?

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've never been angry.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I took a taxi.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There are some things that are hard to do in a car.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There are some things that are hard to do in a car.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There is a cockpit.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There is a driver's seat.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's pretty hard.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There is a Japanese doll made of paper.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's hanging on this.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's hard.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There was a lot of exhaust gas.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There was a traffic jam, so I thought I'd smoke a cigarette.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Can you stop smoking?

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not saying anything.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I put out a lot of exhaust gas and got in the car.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why don't you stop smoking?

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's easy to say that.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you don't smoke, there will be smoke near you.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's not good for your body to smoke.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What?

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I didn't say that.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you smoke 20 cigarettes, even if you don't smoke, you smoke one.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're saying something.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's very bad for your body.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Who smokes 20 cigarettes?

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you say it's bad for your body, you shouldn't smoke.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's strange.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm doing this in class.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's the same as saying that it stinks.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know if you stink, but what about me?

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's strange, too.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not strange at all.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's not strange.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to think about this.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What about the one who wants to smoke?

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The one who wants to smoke?

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You smoke, right?

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You want to smoke, but you have to put up with it.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You have to put up with the fact that you want to smoke.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You have to put up with it.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't want to be smoked.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You don't want to be smoked.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You have to put up with the fact that you want to smoke.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Men and women are the same.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You don't want to be smoked.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Women don't want to be smoked.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Maybe you don't want to be smoked, but I want to be smoked.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You should be smoked.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You don't want to be smoked.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't want to be smoked.

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You don't want to be smoked.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You don't want to be smoked.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You don't want to be smoked.

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's strange.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The world is wrong.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The wrong thing is...

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You smoke.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You smoke.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can't buy a pet in a mansion.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There are many places where you can't buy a pet in a mansion.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's right.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In the end, everyone endures it.

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In the end, if you ask everyone who lives in a mansion, everyone wants to buy a pet.

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There are more than half of them.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I see.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's why there is an exercise that you can buy a pet in any mansion.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right.

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's better for people who want to buy it.

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's right.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's not good.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Humans and animals have to be together somewhere.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's right.

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why do you want to buy a dog or a cat at home?

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where do you want to buy it?

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have to buy it outside.

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you get too close to animals, they won't be able to do that.

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What do you mean?

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Animals are animals after all.

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you getting angry?

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have to open up.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That was a good question.

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
For humans...

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We're animals, too.

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We're a bit shy.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We're shy.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's what animals are like.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Recently, we've been trying to buy them at home.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Huh?

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We're pretty good.

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can even wear clothes.

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah!

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's right.

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Who?

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm wearing a stylist.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
A caretaker.

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You don't have to do that.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm selling them.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're selling them.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're selling them.

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's the pain of being a caretaker.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The animals will gradually remember.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They'll misunderstand.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They'll misunderstand.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They'll think,

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm not that different from humans.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're the same.

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm the same.

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's what they'll think.

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I see.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's when animals come into this human society.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
On this earth,

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it's going to be a mess.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We're animals after all.

248
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you kidding me?

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's going to be an animal world.

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We're animals.

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We're going to keep buying them.

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We're letting them stay at home.

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They're all talking.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They're listening.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are they listening?

256
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They're listening.

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They're listening.

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What do they remember?

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Words.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
They're starting to learn how to talk.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
They're starting to talk.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They're starting to stand up.

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They don't understand.

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's going to be a mess.

265
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's going to be fun.

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not going to be fun.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why?

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What?

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They're going to talk a lot.

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's what it's going to be.

271
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You're talking about a dog and a cat.

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're talking about a caterpillar.

273
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's going to be a mess.

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The caterpillar is going to be a mess.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But they can't say that.

276
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They can only talk about what they remember.

277
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Humans are the same.

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What you're talking about is...

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't interrupt me.

280
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's what you taught your mother.

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Stop it.

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Stop it.

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're asking me to stop.

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It has a stronger meaning than the word stop.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's what your mother taught you.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
She's asking you to stop.

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She's asking you to stop.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This way of talking is...

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
your mother...

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Stop it.

291
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Even this way of talking is what your mother taught you.

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's what your mother taught you.

293
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I want to tell them to stay away from them.

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's why I told you not to do such things at home.

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

296
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There are many kinds of people, but...

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Glass monkey.

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What?

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Glass monkey.

301
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Glass monkey? I've never seen it.

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There are animals that look like glass monkeys.

303
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What kind of face do they have?

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's why they look like this.

305
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And they do this with trees.

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sometimes they do this.

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You're laughing, aren't you?

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm a big fan of cleanliness.

309
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, really?

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm a big fan of cleanliness.

311
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So I clean as much as I can.

312
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You know, I look pretty wild, don't I?

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, really.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Ah, I see.

315
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I feel like I'm going to die of starvation.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's dangerous.

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You shouldn't do such a thing in this day and age.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, no, no.

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I feel like I'm going to die with a knife.

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No, it's serious.

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

323
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Can you see it?

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, I can't.

325
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I can see it.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's dangerous.

327
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I really like cleanliness.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh, really?

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're dirty, aren't you?

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You're dirty, aren't you?

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're normal, aren't you?

332
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
As a man.

333
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm a bit too clean.

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What's normal about it?

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You haven't taken good care of yourself.

336
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I asked Takasu today.

337
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What do you mean?

338
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You haven't taken good care of yourself.

339
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You have a lot of freckles.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No, no, no.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll leave it alone.

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Like this?

343
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have this much.

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You have this much?

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If you have that much, this is a beach.

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is an accessory.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What is this man talking about?

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If it's like this, you're the father.

349
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You're the father.

350
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, you're the one who's attached to the father.

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're the one who's attached to Hamada.

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is this Hamada?

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is the father.

354
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is my partner.

355
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If it's like this...

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's talk here.

357
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The child is cute.

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why?

359
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Does that make my child do something?

360
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're going to get caught.

361
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Your mother only sings when she's embarrassed.

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Your father is an old man.

363
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Please tell us a little more about the exciting thing you talked about on air the other day.

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What is exciting?

365
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The fight is about to start.

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's about to start.

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What will happen?

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What will happen?

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What will happen?

370
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's because the skit is over.

371
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Look, look, look, look.

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This whole thing is not included.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is exciting.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is exciting.

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This space has been peaceful until now.

376
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's why we can call it exciting.

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You get it now, right?

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's because the exciting thing has already started.

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wait a minute.

382
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What is exciting?

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Is it a person who has that kind of shape?

384
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You did this with all your might.

386
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But you can't see it, but is it a person who has that kind of shape?

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I've seen it before.

388
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That exciting thing.

389
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What kind of person is it?

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's what I want to know.

391
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's a person, isn't it?

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's not a person.

393
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's this mouth.

394
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You've seen it before, haven't you?

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I've seen it before.

396
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you do this in the New Year, it's a person.

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
To be honest, it's a human-shaped thing.

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's a human-shaped house.

399
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I know.

400
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But it has this kind of shape, doesn't it?

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's a provocation, isn't it?

403
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a provocation.

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This is what we call exciting.

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You should have told me something else.

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll tell you something good.

407
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What is it?

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Exciting is not just one person.

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Then how many people are exciting?

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Exciting is me when something exciting happens.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, no, no.

412
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then how many people are excited when something exciting happens?

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What?

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Exciting is me when something exciting happens.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Then how many people are excited when something exciting happens?

416
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Exciting is a completely different person.

417
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a completely different person.

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's not a person.

419
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you say it wrong, it's a different person.

420
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Exciting is also a fight.

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes.

423
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
A circuit.

424
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There are many things.

425
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What I saw was the excitement of a fight.

426
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So he had long hair, didn't he?

427
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He had long hair.

428
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He had a lot of hair.

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What kind of hair?

430
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He was a man with a scar on his cheek.

431
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Was he a barber?

432
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, he wasn't a barber.

433
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He had a scar on his cheek.

434
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And when he was off...

435
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Why do you know so much?

436
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

437
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He was swimming in the pool on the roof of a hotel.

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's Yakuza.

439
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
No, no, no.

440
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's not it.

441
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I want to rest.

442
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I want to rest in the hotel pool.

443
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm Yakuza.

444
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
No, no, no.

445
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And there was a small band in the house.

446
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't see it.

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What?

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's the worst.

449
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know.

450
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I want to learn more.

451
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You can learn anything.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Do you have a license?

453
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's because I have a boyish heart.

454
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
On Monday morning after this broadcast,

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
about six o'clock in the morning,

456
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
on Zoom,

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Tatsuo Umemiya was mixing a special edition of our Dantan Special.

458
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He was on Zoom as a punishment game.

459
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I lost the punishment game.

460
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I went there in the morning.

461
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I want you to do it.

462
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

463
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Everyone watching this,

464
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in a few hours after this,

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
everyone will be out.

466
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
In a few hours?

467
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes.

468
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Tatsuo Umemiya will sleep.

469
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I can't do it.
