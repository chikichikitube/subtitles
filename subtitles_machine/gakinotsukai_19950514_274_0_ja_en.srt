00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000

I'll show you my pose

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can only draw the face

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll show you

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
When did he become like this?

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is my drawing

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000

This is my daughter

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please call your father

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She got it

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is my father's prize

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Congratulations

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000

Congratulations

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is not a joke

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is Mos Burger's employee

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She got it

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Have you ever had a match?

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is the first time

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is the first time

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is this?

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is the product

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Heipo used this

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000

Stop it

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You look like a mouse

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's see his joke

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yamasaki

This is the finished product

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can't see this

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What are you looking at?

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's holding this

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm angry

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I thought you were great

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What?

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I like my character

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm normal

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm the same as always

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't want to say this

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You didn't say it

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
My ribs are broken

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't go to the hospital

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I was told by the doctor

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My ribs are broken

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Stop it

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Your ribs are broken

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I told you

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm wearing a corset

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just put it on

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's broken

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Who told you?

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I know

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I told you it's broken

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When I touch it, the sound is different

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There's a low sound

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't care

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's really broken

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I know

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's why

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's explain why your ribs are broken

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's explain

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you don't hear this, you won't know what's broken

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't touch it

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's explain why it's broken

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a low sound

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There was a short film

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was looking at the table

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was looking at the monitor

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It was hard to see

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There was a chair

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was looking at the monitor

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The chair goes like this

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You put your weight on the back

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The chair goes like this

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was standing on the chair

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
There was an iron stick behind me

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Really?

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
An iron stick?

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's stuck

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There was an iron plate

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I hit it

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If it was a drama, everyone would have stopped

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Everyone would have stopped

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why?

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's broken

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Stop it

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I can't do it

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They can't do it

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I couldn't breathe for a moment

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I couldn't breathe for a while

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But the camera was rolling and I was laughing

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's variety

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't help it

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm fine

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not broken

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's really hard

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's broken

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't think it's broken

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why?

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can't sleep

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It hurts

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's why it's broken

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's broken

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's broken

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's broken?

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't lie

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's broken

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's a big deal

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not broken, but it's broken

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's broken

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's definitely broken

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
From now on

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I thought it was amazing

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The moment you fall

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How many seconds is 0?

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's fast

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's fast

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's not fast at all

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
When I fell, I thought it was over

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't think about anything

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I thought I was going to fall, hit my head, and go to the hospital

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You thought that?

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I thought

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was fun

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's a lie

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You lied, didn't you?

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a lie, isn't it?

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a lie

246
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's true

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You did chop

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I did chop, but it's a lie

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You did

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been looking at the battery for a month

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It doesn't take that long

252
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It took

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You've been wearing it since yesterday

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm wearing a corset right now

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You should

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You should go to the doctor and get a corset

257
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why don't you wear something like this?

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You should go to the doctor

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why did I get a corset?

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was easy

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's go to the post office

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's hot

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello, Mr. Cha

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's a lie

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's Mr. Cha

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I heard that Mr. Cha did it by himself

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Matsui is so famous

268
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Who said that?

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's been a long time

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's a twin deed

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Is this the picture?

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not Tsumagoi

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's Fujitera

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's right

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's Fujitera

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's Fujitera?

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The opening was the best

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The opening was the best

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Mr. Cha was dancing

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He was doing something like this

282
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's been a long time since I played the guitar

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's right

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Mr. Matsumoto

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is it okay?

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's totally fine

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's totally fine

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I didn't think I could play in a place like this

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
In front of the audience

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is it okay?

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's totally fine

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Really?

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How many people should I play?

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How many people should I play?

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
How many people should I play?

296
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I want to play something that I'm good at

297
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Something you're good at?

298
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes

299
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you holding it here?

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Wait, I'm matching it

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Matching

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Matching

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
My ribs hurt

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Wait

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Wait a minute

306
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll show you Mr. Cha

307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's right

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's right

309
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll show you the same thing

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll show you the same thing

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll show you the action that Mr. Matsumoto taught me

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Is that right?

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Of course

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Mr. Cha, you're still good

316
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hey

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're still doing it while the sound is left

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're still doing it while the sound is left

319
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Mr. Cha, you're still doing it while the sound is left

320
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Did you get caught?

321
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hasn't it changed?

322
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's right

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Basically

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's round

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's round

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's round

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's round

328
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's round

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's round

330
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's round

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's round

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's round

333
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You were always like this

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We did it together

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's enough

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Cha, you're going to get a stomachache

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll hold it

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're all dirty

339
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you

340
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Thank you

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're so dirty

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You didn't teach me at all

343
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's true

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We're old friends

345
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You will be surprised

346
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You'll be surprised when your relatives come

347
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's true

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's the same

349
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This is just right for your situation

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What do you do when you're having a hard time?

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's sad when I'm having a hard time

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's hard because it hurts

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What do you do when you're having a hard time?

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm more of a bridal man

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Bridal?

356
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You know what I mean

357
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're a bridal man

358
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So at home...

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Of course I haven't used it yet

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I have a wedding dress

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You haven't used it once, when are you going to use it?

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll take it out like this

363
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're still going to use it?

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Right?

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll turn around

366
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And then I'll say, ah, hurry

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So cool

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I feel like you're going to do something

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's really...

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I feel like you're going to think I'm crazy

371
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I feel like you're going to think I'm going to do something weird

372
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I feel like you're going to think I'm going to do something weird

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's normal for me to get mad

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It starts and ends with a bow

375
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's weird that I keep my socks on

376
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why?

377
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm barefoot but I keep my socks on

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm serious

379
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You can take them off

380
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't want to wait for the four of you

381
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Ah, Aoyama

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The four of you

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Aoyama

384
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I've been waiting for the same amount of time

385
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's in me

386
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I didn't give everything to you

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What?

388
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Mysterious

389
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, no, no

390
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm just wearing my socks

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It doesn't have a deep meaning

392
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think I keep my socks on

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ah, of course you do

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Of course you do, Chirorin

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Who's Chirorin?

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Who's Chirorin?

397
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Nomi's life is...

398
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why are you pulling my leg?

399
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why are you pulling my leg when I'm talking?

400
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't get it

401
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Why are you so angry?

402
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
How long is Nomi's life?

403
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't know

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Nomi's life is really fast

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It flies

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's dead in the air

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's flying

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why does it have to fly and die?

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When it's flying, it's going to land

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Of course, Nomi

411
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I want to go that far

412
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Nomi's like, okay, let's go

413
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Nomi's like, let's go that far

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yay!

415
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't feel good

416
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
In the air, I don't feel good

417
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't feel good

418
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sleepy

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't feel good

420
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's cold

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Do you have a theme for Downtown?

422
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What kind of song is it?

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't have a theme for Downtown

424
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I have one, you idiot

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Who wrote it?

426
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Me

427
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Can I teach you?

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No, no

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You can't do that

430
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And then?

431
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Idiot?

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll start with Okinawa Minions

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why?

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It has nothing to do with Okinawa Minions

435
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No, no

436
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You can't do that

437
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's like, click, click

438
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Why don't you do it in Debayashi?

439
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What Debayashi?

440
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Stop this music

441
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, Gaki no Ka?

442
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There's always an opening

443
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen

444
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Stop that

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Stop that?

446
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
No, no

447
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You can't do that

448
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What?

449
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Let me hear it properly

450
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You can't do that

451
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
