1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yoh-kan-kan-no

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yoh-kan-kusai wa nakayoshi da

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Itsumo futari de nitsu yoh-kan

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yoh-kan-no danna

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yoh-kan-no yome

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yoru wa kuri yoh-kan

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, no, no

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it from the beginning

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Don't say that, Matsumoto!

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know if you'll say that

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today...

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm really sleepy

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Matsumoto, don't say that!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry, really

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I slept too much the day before

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I couldn't sleep at all yesterday

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I couldn't sleep until around noon

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was like, I'm done!

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You were awake?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I woke up, and then I woke up

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have lotion left on my body

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, but I'm really sleepy

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm really, really, really, really sleepy

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm really sorry

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I was passing by Harajuku Station

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There was a pharmacy in front of Harajuku Station

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And there was a tea-salon called Tea-Salon Kaze

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I know that place

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's really really really really

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I was driving my car, and I heard the name Tea-Salon Foo

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're saying that too much

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's true!

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In this world, Foo?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I thought it was Nami Nami Foo

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm really sorry

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you know what a brain is?

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hiragana's brain

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you know Hiragana's brain?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hiragana's brain

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What?

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hiragana's brain

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been researching a lot about the brain

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The brain is an interesting thing

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's proof that the brain is being licked

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know what you're talking about

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then tell us

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What does it mean?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
For example

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's called Kabutomushi

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's called Kabutomushi

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not called Kabutomushi, right?

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, it's not

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Right? It's called Kabutomushi

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's the first time you've been able to get your brain

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You've gained citizenship

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You haven't been licked

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is he talking about?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, no, no

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Karate chop is strange, right?

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's strange

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's Karate chop, right?

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's strange that you're saying Karate chop

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's strange that you're saying Karate chop

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's strange that you're saying Karate chop

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But you used to say it

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Really?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Maybe when Karate didn't gain citizenship

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There was Karate

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is chop, right?

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You used to say that this is Karate chop

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I didn't say Karate chop

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, no, no

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's not what I'm trying to say

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's not what I'm trying to say

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Golf club

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right?

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Golf has penetrated into everyone, so it's called a golf club

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In the past, when golf wasn't that popular

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They used to call it a golf club

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A golf club

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So when you have a brain, it's proof that you've been licked

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It means that you haven't been recognized as a person yet

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's there to be licked?

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's there to be licked?

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
For example, let's talk about the easiest one

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Downtown Matsumoto

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is because you're loved

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's established

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Downtown Matsumoto

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You've already gained citizenship

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But you're a sad downtown Hamada

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're being licked

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's your way of saying it

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, no, no

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can say downtown Matsumoto

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can say downtown Hamada

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The level is low

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why do you say that?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm asking if there's anything else that's licked

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hamada's nipples

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right, Hamada's nipples

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You haven't gained citizenship

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you referring to Matsumoto's nipples?

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Matsumoto's nipples

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's your way of saying it

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is that so?

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
When people hear it, they think it's licked

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you don't say it

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You know

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Matsumoto's

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You can't say that

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I want to say this

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to say this

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's easier to understand

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let me say this

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Matsumoto's nipples

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is a no

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because Matsumoto doesn't have nipples

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hamada's nipples

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is because you've gained citizenship

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, I haven't

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's because you're all smelly

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's because you know you're all smelly

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's because you know you're all smelly

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's why you've gained citizenship

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why can't you just say no?

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's strange

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You should say something that everyone can understand

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's because you're alone

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm not alone

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No is

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Say something that's easy to understand

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You know this right?

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's because you're alone

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's because you're alone

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This song

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's impossible

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I heard it on Japanese TV

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No it's not like that

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Japanese TV is probably the fastest

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's because you're alone

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's watch Japanese TV

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No it's not like that

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The reason why you lost your brain

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is because Japanese TV has accepted you

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So if I want to say something

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It doesn't matter

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Just do your best so you can gain your brain

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's a joke

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can't just close it like that

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can't understand

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you do that

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's always going to be 7-3

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's because you're alone

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Matsumoto-san said that you spent your youth in a monkey mountain

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes in a monkey mountain

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It seems that the more your butt is red the more popular you are

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why is that?

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Please teach me how to break my hair so that even a monkey can understand

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know a lot about animals

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I understand

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What do you think?

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Even if you say red

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's because you're fat

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm fat?

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm fat?

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know that word

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you know?

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm fat

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The intonation is weird

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm fat

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What do you mean by fat?

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's because you're sticking out

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You don't use it?

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't use it

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sticking out

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What's wrong with a black guy?

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There are black guys too

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They stick out like a rose

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There are

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's because they're popular with monkeys

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why?

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you think with the same values as humans

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's no answer

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can't think of it as a monkey

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Please teach me

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
For a monkey

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What do you think a butt is for humans?

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Other than a butt

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
For example

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You do this

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What's that for humans?

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Propose

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Propose?

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's like a negligee

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's pretty

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's why

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In that way

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Animals have things that humans can compare to

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I see

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's a monkey for a butt?

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I thought a lot about what it is

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If I put it in front of humans

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know this anymore

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
When I threw a stick

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is it

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If I put it in front of humans

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
A monkey's butt is like a sports car

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ouch

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A bright red sports car

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A red sports car

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You want to ride it

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You say that

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's terrible

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't ever say that in front of me

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't understand

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why are you so stubborn?

225
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What I said is wrong, right?

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What's wrong?

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A sports car

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You said it

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Please tell me the answer

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is negligee

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This is negligee

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's why it's wrong

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you okay?

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is negligee

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Are there any other animals?

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A deer

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
A deer has a horn

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It says I'm a man

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It says I'm a man

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It says I'm a man

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If you put that in front of humans

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a hair liquid

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's what you say

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A lion's male

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Can't he be bald?

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If he can be bald

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's the cause?

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He can be bald

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He can be bald?

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He can be bald

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please tell me the cause

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I haven't seen a lion that's bald

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's because humans don't know how to make a lion bald

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
How to make a lion bald?

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's easy to make a lion bald

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's think about the mechanism

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Stress

259
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If you get stressed, you can make a lion bald

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Without a doubt

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
For example, a lion

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It doesn't matter if it's a zoo

263
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's go in front of a lion

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A lion will pretend to be a house

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I think I'm strong

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you come

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's like this

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's like this

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
A lion is powerful

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's like this

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's like this

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's like this

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is the annoying part of them

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Don't let it happen

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Say wow

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Wow

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Wow

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm interested

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll tell you

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's funny

282
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then the lion

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What is it?

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll say

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
After returning home at night

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was told something strange

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm worried

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm in a bad mood

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Today's guest was strange

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Tomorrow, as usual

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll be strong

292
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The next day

293
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Wow

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's cold

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's cold

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's cold

297
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Wow

298
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Wow

299
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's cold

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Kiss

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Thank you for watching
