1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
On this day, the member of the kids' group was heading to a certain place with black mayonnaise.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Masamatsu-san, what is this?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, Kosugi is wearing damaged jeans, but he's already been damaged enough.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He's not damaged enough to wear jeans.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is not fashionable.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, well.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, well.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Everyone, today we have a letter from the mayor of a town factory.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A letter for two people?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll read it.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a letter from a sudden person. I'm sorry to bother you.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I run a small town factory in Tokyo.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
A Moroccan man who works in a residential area recently, Muhammad,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
has been homesick.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He hasn't been able to leave his room.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But Muhammad is a big fan of Black Mayonnaise, especially Kosugi.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When he saw the two of you on the show, he got back his energy.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I hope you won't let Muhammad down with your own power.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why are you here again?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Because there are other shows on Black Mayonnaise.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I heard you were on the show recently.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, I was on the show.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I wonder if you watched it.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not the one who said you should do your best.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's Ega-chan.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, no, no. I was the only one who did the first 6 changes.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can't make a mistake.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do the 7 changes.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you kidding me?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You can't even get the rules right.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's not me.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll tell you.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can't do it.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's not true.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's not true.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The first step is to encourage Muhammad to go out of town.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, isn't this the factory?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Suddenly, the factory appears.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, wow.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Good evening.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, thank you very much.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're from the same company?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, I am.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm Yamashita from the Ministry of Commerce.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, I see.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Nice to meet you.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I heard you're from the same company.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, I am.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm from the upper room.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, really?

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, I am.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, really?

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Excuse me.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sorry.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a bit dirty.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, no problem.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, excuse me.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please put on your slippers.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes, sir.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Please come in.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Please come in.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I live around here.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here?

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You don't come out all the time?

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not very good at it.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why don't we try asking him?

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He'll be happy if we do that.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to ask him, but...

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's ask him.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's easier to come out like this.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Muhammado!

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The two of you from the drama world are here!

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ah, there he is.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ah, Muhammado.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello. Nice to meet you.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm Black Manez.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm Black Manez Kosugi.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I heard that you liked us.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I thought it would be nice if you could help us.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm fine.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's strange.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can't get a reaction.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's you, right?

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is it because I was there?

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not like that.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But it's a Brahma 4.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I saw it with my eyes that there was nothing in it.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
From the back.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I saw it with my eyes that it was black.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't help it if you laugh.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why don't you do it like you always do on TV?

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Put in a switch and throw it.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Make it look like a funny party.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, Hagio-dori.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What?

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hagio-dori.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What's with the sudden change?

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're not feeling well, right?

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're worried about me.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you talking about?

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm thinking about my feelings.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't care about your feelings.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not doing this to make you popular.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Who are you doing this for?

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
For Mugamage.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll bring him here.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Excuse me.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's okay.

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Excuse me.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's okay.

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can't just come in like that.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's fine.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's with him all of a sudden?

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right?

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, Kosei-kun really...

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He's been working since he was a kid.

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, okay.

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, oh, oh.

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, okay, okay.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The sound is coming from the radio.

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Muhammad, your beloved Cosumi-san will do something for you.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, here it comes.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,500
Hageodori! Hageodori!

133
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Tetsuougei no hageodori!

134
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,000
Hageodori! Hageodori!

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,500
Tetsuougei no hageodori!

136
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Not at all.

137
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
You were laughing?

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
No, no.

139
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I thought you'd laugh when I opened the door.

140
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
But I thought, well, I guess I was right.

141
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
And you started dancing, no doubt.

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm angry.

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
What's with that hageodori?

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
What?

145
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,860
It's clearly fire troubling me.

146
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,900
No, I'm having all the fun.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
Fire again are you?

148
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,220
Yeah. I do.

149
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,500
You think you can take all day without dancing once?

150
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,860
You got to watch the sound.

151
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,800
This is all a mistake, period.

152
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,960
How dare you moisurge me!

153
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,000
What was that?

154
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,860
Not a problem.

155
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,200
What made you make so much noise there?

156
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,300
An occurred scene.

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,900
I am having fun.

158
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
Beat it!

159
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,140
Hey!

160
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,640
You've lost tough inside.

161
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,340
What chunk of wood is sticking?

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:35,540
400

163
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,180
What a shame!

164
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,180
What the hell?

165
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
What the hell?

166
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,180
You're not supposed to touch my body!

167
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Don't touch it!

168
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
This is not a good idea.

169
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Why are you fighting?

170
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Wait, wait, wait.

171
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
This is not good.

172
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Muhammad is...

173
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
You're scaring me.

174
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Who is it?

175
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
Muhammad.

176
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Muhammad.

177
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,180
I'm not going to do it.

178
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,180
Who do you think it is?

179
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Stop it.

180
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Stop fighting.

181
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,180
If you keep asking questions like that, I won't be able to finish it.

182
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,180
You are definitely more...

183
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,180
I thought you were more beautiful.

184
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm not beautiful at all.

185
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,180
You're not beautiful.

186
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,180
Are you doing it?

187
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,180
The Eurobeat version.

188
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,180
You're 10 years too early to judge if it's slippery.

189
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
What are you trying to do?

190
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,180
You're not even a bit different from me.

191
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,180
If you're not even a bit different from me, you're a bit over the top.

192
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
Be careful.

193
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,180
You can still say, what if I do it?

194
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,180
Why don't you say, do it?

195
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
What if I do it?

196
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,180
My friends said it was fun.

197
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,180
Eurobeat version.

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,180
Really?

199
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,180
Who's that?

200
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,180
What's up?

201
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
What's up, Madoh?

202
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,180
I heard that Mr. Kosugi will do something for us again.

203
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
The last one is the last one.

204
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,180
It's over.

205
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
It's over.

206
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
It's a really good place.

207
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
It's good.

208
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Don't give up.

209
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Don't give up.

210
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
It's coming out.

211
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,180
It's coming out.

212
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,180
What the hell?

213
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm already tired.

214
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
It's coming, it's coming.

215
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Hey.

216
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,180
You've been dancing for yourself since the beginning.

217
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
What?

218
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,180
I saw you were going to get a lot of likes.

219
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
Are you still saying that?

220
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
What's with that way of saying it?

221
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
What's with that way of saying it?

222
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
You don't have the right to say that!

223
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
What?

224
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Excuse me, can I talk to you for a moment?

225
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
You don't have the right to say that!

226
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,180
What?

227
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,180
I don't know what's going on, but I'm always in a bad mood when I dance.

228
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
Are you jealous?

229
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,180
Do it!

230
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,180
I don't know if I'm jealous, but I'm always told that I can't do it.

231
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:41,180
I'm trying to do my best, but if you look at me from above and see that I'm trying, it's harder to dance.

232
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,180
You're a con man!

233
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Why are you talking to me like that?

234
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
I don't understand!

235
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Try to understand!

236
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
Just dance once!

237
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,180
If you win, dance!

238
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
I can't dance!

239
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
You can't appear on TV because I'm naked!

240
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
You're so young!

241
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,180
What's wrong with you?

242
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,180
What's wrong with you?

243
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,180
Stop it!

244
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,180
Why do you keep making trouble?

245
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Let's be friends.

246
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Let's have fun.

247
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
I'll do it a little bit more.

248
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
You don't know.

249
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
It's a little bit more.

250
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
You guys do it.

251
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
It's impossible.

252
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,180
You are doing it on a TV show, so you don't know if you don't do it properly.

253
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
Fukuwajitsu.

254
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
Can you do it?

255
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,180
You said that you could do Fukuwajitsu.

256
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Why can't I do Fukuwajitsu?

257
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
So, you're going to break it?

258
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,180
You're going to do the same thing you did when you were a kid?

259
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,180
What are you so obsessed with?

260
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
I've never laughed at a bald man.

261
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Let me try.

262
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
I have a doll.

263
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,180
What?

264
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
What's wrong?

265
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
Are you okay?

266
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
What's wrong?

267
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:54,960
Kozuki's got a

268
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
Kozuki's got a

269
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
Really?

270
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
Really?

271
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
It's so big.

272
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,180
I've never seen this before.

273
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
I didn't know you could do this.

274
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,180
Muhammado, Kosugi-san will do something for you.

275
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
Come on out.

276
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,180
This is difficult.

277
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
He's a beginner.

278
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Hello, Muhammado.

279
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,180
Today I'll introduce my friend.

280
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Taro, introduce yourself.

281
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,180
Hello. I'm Toramu.

282
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,180
You're always sleeping.

283
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,180
There's a baritone snake over there.

284
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Who's a baritone snake?

285
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
It's hiding in the room.

286
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,180
It's hiding in the room, so...

287
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Why is it hiding in the room? Let's go cut it.

288
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,180
That's right! You should have listened to me directly!

289
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
Hey, Masa-kun!

290
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,180
Why didn't you leave the room?

291
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,180
I was stuck in there for a year!

292
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,180
The one who brought me out of there was the world of Fukuwajitsu!

293
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Hey, can you stop saying that?

294
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,180
Your life as a fukkaku might be our own.

295
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,180
That's enough!

296
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,180
If you come back, I'll be a fukkaku doll!

297
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
What?

298
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,180
What?

299
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Oh, man.

300
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Oh, man.

301
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,180
Oh, man.

302
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Oh, man.

303
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
I was just about to go to the bathroom, but I got a little angry.

304
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh, man.

305
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,180
I don't think you need a helicopter match now.

306
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,180
What?

307
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
I heard the sound of a helicopter.

308
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Do you think there are people like that now?

309
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Do you think there are people like that now?

310
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Hey, I'll put this on. If you don't want to turn it, it's useless.

311
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Why are you waiting for the helicopter with your judgement?

312
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,180
Just now, in the bus, you were playing with the damaged jeans of Mr. Matsumoto.

313
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,180
When I tried to face the camera, you said you didn't need it.

314
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Learn from there.

315
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
What?

316
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,180
The way you learned to shoot in the morning, you don't need it here.

317
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,180
Why are you making him say that?

318
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
Because you don't know.

319
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
I don't know!

320
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
What the hell are you talking about?

321
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,180
Nothing is better than me!

322
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
Nothing is better than you!

323
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
You don't know anything!

324
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,180
I don't care what you did or what you got done!

325
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,180
I only taught you how to do Kagami Junsa at the event!

326
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
If it's not enough, then do more!

327
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
You can't do it all at once!

328
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,180
I only did it once at the event!

329
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,180
I didn't know you were going to do it.

330
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
You only did the Ironton Senna thing, right?

331
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
That was funny.

332
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
What?

333
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
What?

334
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
No one did that.

335
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,180
What's with the Ironton Senna? Don't be so cocky.

336
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm not cocky. You're always a little bit cocky.

337
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
You don't have any love.

338
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
What?

339
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,180
You don't have any kind words.

340
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,180
You're just pressuring me.

341
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,180
I don't understand.

342
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
If I talk to you, my brain will go crazy.

343
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
What are you talking about?

344
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,180
Try to understand!

345
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,180
You can't do anything because you're doing something you can't even do a single GEP!

346
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,180
I'm doing GEP!

347
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,180
If your GEP was a Sakuya stage, I wouldn't be doing this!

348
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,180
You're the one who saw me get into trouble with GEP!

349
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Why are you saying that here?

350
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
I'm really sorry.

351
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
It's probably because of the times.

352
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
It's a big deal.

353
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,180
You should show your ass in front of your wife!

354
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
You can't do that!

355
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,180
I can't do it.

356
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,180
I can't do it.

357
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,180
Show your ass!

358
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,180
Who's the unlucky guy?

359
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Show your ass!

360
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
Don't call me unlucky!

361
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,180
Show your ass!

362
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,180
I can't do it.

363
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
I took off my underwear.

364
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Hey, Anmado! Yoshida-san is coming to see you!

365
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Come out!

366
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Odamazu-kun.

367
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
I know you're lonely.

368
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
I don't know if you want to see your father.

369
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:52,180
But I think you should think of your teacher as your father.

370
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,180
And what is the most scary thing about your parents?

371
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
You're talking so nicely.

372
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,180
I think you're most afraid of not working in Japan.

373
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,180
What's the problem?

374
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
Speak clearly.

375
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,180
So your father...

376
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Hurry up and give me a break! What are you doing?

377
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
I can't do it!

378
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:17,180
You're talking about the body of a leech!

379
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,180
Why do you want to get a cold from your cheeks?

380
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Let me see your cheeks!

381
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:32,180
You shouldn't mess with my cheeks when I'm depressed because of my body.

382
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,180
You shouldn't have two complexes at once.

383
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
Why?

384
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,180
Why don't you just do it?

385
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
I told you to get the shoe that you gave me.

386
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
That light one?

387
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
That's the one.

388
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,180
Why don't you get it?

389
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Why can't you get it?

390
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
Well...

391
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,180
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
That's enough.

393
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
That's enough?

394
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

395
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
No, no, I can't.

396
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,180
You can.

397
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
I can't take it anymore.

398
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
I can't take it anymore.

399
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I don't know what to do. I have to get this out.

400
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Just do it.

401
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
That's right.

402
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Sing.

403
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,180
You're the only one who can sing.

404
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
If you say that, it'll be hard to sing.

405
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Are you trying to crush me?

406
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,180
I know I'm always in your way.

407
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,180
When I hear your high ratings, I know I'm always in your way.

408
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:47,180
But I'm not a man who would pull you down and try to make you fall.

409
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,180
Believe me.

410
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Are you okay?

412
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Yeah.

413
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
Is something wrong?

414
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:04,180
The rice cooker's assistant will do something interesting this time.

415
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,180
Yes, yes.

416
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Excuse me.

417
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
Sure.

418
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,180
How about a song about a mother who's worried because her child is homesick?

419
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,180
Oh, that's good.

420
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,180
What is it?

421
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
It's good.

422
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:32,180
My baby, are you crying?

423
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,180
I want to hold you.

424
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:47,180
I want to wash your baby's shoulder, baby

425
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:57,180
I want to cook your dinner

426
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:05,180
I want to wash your pajamas

427
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,180
Baby-chan! Baby-chan!

428
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,180
What will happen if I put my sleeves through your pants?

429
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
It's almost there.

430
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
It's almost time to cook dinner!

431
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
Baby-chan!

432
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
You're so oppressive!

433
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Hurry up and take another look!

434
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Baby-chan!

435
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,180
The time of the ring is approaching!

436
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Baby-chan!

437
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Mom loves Dad!

438
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Baby-

439
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Ah!

440
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,180
Ah!

441
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
Ah!

442
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,180
One more step!

443
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,180
That was close!

444
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
I almost fell.

445
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
That was close.

446
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
I don't know why.

447
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,180
You stepped into Muhammad's family too much.

448
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
I didn't step into his family.

449
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I became his family.

450
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
You were washing your pajamas.

451
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
If your mother washes them, they'll get even dirtier.

452
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Excuse me.

453
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Excuse me, my father...

454
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
You should have sung!

455
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
Why did you do that?

456
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
What?

457
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
When I was...

458
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
Yeah?

459
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
...working on the 7th edition...

460
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah?

461
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
...I was doing something else...

462
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Yeah?

463
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,180
...and you called me a fool!

464
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,180
What are you talking about?

465
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,180
I was singing my best and you called me a fool!

466
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,180
You're a f***ing a**hole!

467
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Stop it!

468
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
Stop that!

469
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
Stop it! Stop it!

470
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Stop it! Stop it!

471
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
Let's go home!

472
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,180
Let's go home!

473
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
Let's go home!

474
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Is it impossible?

475
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
It's impossible.

476
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,180
I want to save Muhammado-kun.

477
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Even if he tries to persuade her with such pure feelings, her feelings won't reach him.

478
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Can he not break the barrier in his heart?

479
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,180
No way. I'll do the hakeodori one more time.

480
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
You're going to do the hakeodori?

481
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Yes. I brought a hakeodori that's easy to dance.

482
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Really?

483
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Yes.

484
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,180
I'm not good at dancing with my hair up.

485
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Really?

486
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,180
I've never seen a man who dances so easily.

487
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
Really?

488
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
Yes.

489
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,180
Please come out, the dining room.

490
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,180
You can't dance!

491
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,180
You can't dance!

492
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Why are you so popular?

493
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
You have the answer!

494
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
You can't dance?

495
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
You're a big ass.

496
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
You're a big ass!

497
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
You have that kind of thing?

498
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
You say such bad things sometimes!

499
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,180
You idiot!

500
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
What the hell are you doing?
