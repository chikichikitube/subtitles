1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Whether Selig wins or Parig wins, it's a punishment game if you lose.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This time it's amazing.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What is it?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Skydiving.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If I do it, it's Parig.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What about you?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Parig.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Parig.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Parig.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then you're Selig, right?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you playing golf?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Selig is going to win today.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
One point, three points.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's not good.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's not good.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Who's next?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Parig, Parig, Parig, Parig.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What the hell is that?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's 0-0, right?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, it's 0-0.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,240
Do what you want.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
J.O.L.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let him go.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This program is brought to you by the first sponsor and the sponsor you are about to see.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This program is brought to you by the first sponsor and the sponsor you are about to see.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey!

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't just stand there!

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey!

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Give me a double!

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bro, can you fly instead of me?

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey! Don't just stand there!

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Did it go in?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Did it go in?

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Did it go in?

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did it go in?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It went in!

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes!

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This guy is tough!

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hey, drink it!

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey, drink it!

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Alright, alright!

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I only have Hoshihuma left to drink!

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Really!

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Come on!

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why is this guy sweating so much?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's fat!

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right, this guy is weird!

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
His throat is dry!

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Alright!

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh no!

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It went in!

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Alright!

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Out!

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's out, right?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's out, it's out!

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's over?

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's over!

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What is this crazy way to end it?

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What is this crazy way to end it?

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey! Come on!

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're so lame!

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hamada-kun, let's have you fly!

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Good job!

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Good job!

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is my last show!

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't want to see you ever again!

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hamada-kun, I think you're in a really good mood.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In the end, I just want to say that I have a lot of other friends.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello!

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hello, really!

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello!

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How was it today?

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What do you mean?

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I thought about a lot of things from America.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
When it came to skydiving.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry to say this, but I don't need it!

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait!

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What?

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've been saying that I don't need it!

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, so I don't need it anymore.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is there such a reason?

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If I don't need it, then I don't need it either!

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, no, that's a different story.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why?

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I...

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah?

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You told me to do it, but I've been saying that I don't need it since I was in the dressing room.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't need it!

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't need it!

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then it's your fault!

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't need it!

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why don't you need it?

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't need it.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I used to have a weird habit.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What kind of habit?

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you fly from high up, you'll have a weird feeling.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't need it.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You probably won't be able to capture it.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't need it.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There are other things.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's why I told you to be more detailed.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
More detailed.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A little bit more.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A little bit more?

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You don't have to zoom in and look like a crazy person like this.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, right?

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You have to be shy and think about that.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
From such a high place...

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You really don't need to be shy.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't need to be shy!

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You really don't need to be shy.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you going to do?

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's scary.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone does it.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't have the guts to jump in first.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You'll be pushed from behind.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You won't be able to jump in, so the instructor behind you will do it.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Otherwise, it won't start, no matter how long it takes.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If I don't do it, I'll fall and get pushed in.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's what I'm looking for!

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Really.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's unbearable.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's impossible.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have to get to your destination.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You don't know where you'll land depending on the direction.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right?

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You'll be scared.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You'll be scared again if you're at the yakuza office.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You'll be scared.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You'll be able to get out of the window cleanly.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You'll be able to get out of the window cleanly.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You'll be scared again.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's a double fear.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You'll fall and get out of the window cleanly.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But if you faint the moment you get out, it'll look cool.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's cool too.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You'll come down and make a big noise.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's cool too.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's cool too.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It'll be scary and you'll be a white rock.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know about that.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You'll be a white rock but what will you do if I fall?

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's not true.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll tie you up here.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Seriously.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What should I do?

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I told you.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Skydiving...

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Go home.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You said it.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I kicked you.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
See? See? See?

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So stop skydiving and get into the cage.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's fine.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's fine, right?

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You won't be able to get in.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If it's a cage.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But Takasu from Kosei said that if the shark is small, it'll get in.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's scary.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If it's small, it'll be fine.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, if it's small...

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If it's this small, it'll eat more than half of your mouth.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's gross.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And if it's a big shark, it'll be small.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's big.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you look at it from afar, it's big.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But if you look at it from close up, it's this big.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's the type to sweat.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you wearing?

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you wearing something?

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If it comes in like that, it'll be scary.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But that's fine.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Basically...

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you talk to the staff, for example, if you're going to fly,

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll be the instructor.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll make sure you get in.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll tell you where to go.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But you don't have a parachute.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you just fix it here, your back and stomach.

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The teacher's back has a parachute.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So...

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Damn it.

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going to take off my glasses.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't be so modest!

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If you lose your temper, you'll have to do a lot of jokes while you're flying.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you lose your temper, you'll have only one finger.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I see.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is bad.

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm really happy to be able to do this in this world.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you talking about?

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are you talking about?

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you die in a variety show, that's fine.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
At the beginning?

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's fine.

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But when I die, there will be a lot of people who are in trouble.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Who?

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No one can tell.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Even if you do something like that.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll be in trouble if I die.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you die, the conversation between you two will end.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll be in trouble.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But...

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But if you die in a variety show, you'll have to do a lot of jokes while you're flying.

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I really hate it!

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If I die, the funeral will probably be a mess.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's too bad.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But if I lose, I'll be in trouble.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If I lose, the next day I'll be looking for someone who looks like me.

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Even if I went to Thailand, I wouldn't be there.

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's hard to find someone who looks like you in Japan.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's harder to find someone who looks like you in the Philippines.

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Wow!

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is really bad.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was looking for someone who looked like me on TV.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you lose this time, you'll have to cut the pipe.

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want to lose.

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Even if you cut the pipe, you can't get it back.

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Really?

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You can't get it back.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why?

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're so detailed.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've already tried it.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If you think I'm funny, you can cut it.

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And if you think I want a kid, you can get it back.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really?

239
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Even if you do that, it's no use.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where is the proof of the punishment?

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Kyo-Boku, you said you've already cut the pipe, so you can't put out the pipe here.

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't tell if I did.

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Right?

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was like, let's see!

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But they still came out

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What are we going to do?

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Eh?

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How are we going to prove that they came out?

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We're going to show them that we're good

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Normally there would be people like this

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But at the start everyone was like this

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Everyone was like

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm going to die

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's right

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You have to be able to tell by looking at them

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's right

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's right

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If you were given a prize, how many times would you be able to fly?

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That one was better, the bungee jump

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No, that one was worse

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The one where you put a rope on your leg

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There's that one, right?

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
From the top

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
To the very edge

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's from some country, right?

267
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's like a ceremony

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's like falling from a tree

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's right

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There's also a country where you put a bone on your nose at the ceremony

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Foreigners really don't know what they're thinking

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But apparently that's how it is

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Last year I was watching the news

274
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
About a dog raising an octopus

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's a dog that loves to raise octopuses

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I was doing a VTR in the morning

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The octopus was going up

278
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The dog was forced to be tied up here

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The dog was doing that

280
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The octopus was going up like this

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You don't know how many dogs there are

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There was no reaction

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was normal

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was going up like this

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I love to raise octopuses

286
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hello

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're smiling

288
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I am

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let me introduce this person

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What?

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is this really you?

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're not

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're mistaken

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why am I mistaken?

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Shut up!

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're mistaken

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This is rude

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's ask him directly

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's your name?

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm Kato Fumiya

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Kato Fumiya

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You have a nice bust

303
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How many centimeters?

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You've never measured it?

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You've never measured it?

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Bring me a measuring tape

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Are you putting something in?

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm not

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're not putting anything in

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
See?

312
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You're so full of yourself

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're really full of yourself

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't have any friends

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Friends?

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I have a lot of friends

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are they your friends?

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Thank you

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's ask him

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well then

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's ask him

324
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This person

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He's from Ibaraki

326
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
His pen name is Hide

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I always watch your videos

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
By the way

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
In Nonno

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What do you mean by Nonno?

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In Nonno

332
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There are 100 men you want to date

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Matsumoto-san is in the 50th place

334
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Congratulations

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hamaya-san is in the 69th place

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Congratulations

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So did you lose to Ucchan and Nanchan

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Over your thoughts?

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Where is Nanchan in the 10th place?

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Nanchan is in the 10th place

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Nanchan is in the 10th place?

342
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Nanchan is in the 10th place?

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're lying

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Nanchan was in the top of the list

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Nanchan was in the top of the list?

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Really?

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Who else is there?

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Then you said earlier

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm in the 50th place

350
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's 50, right? That means there are 49 people up there, right?

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Who's there?

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The one who bought it from me!

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And then...

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This...

355
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Which one should I go with?

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Anything?

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What?

358
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Ah, I'll go with this one.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Nakano-kun's...

360
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Kawawa Akira-kun.

361
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's dirty.

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Your nose will come out too, right?

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Since a while ago, Machan has been saying that he doesn't come to work.

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But in the ending, I saw the two of you leaving.

365
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I understood that Machan hates his job.

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hama-chan is acting cute in front of the camera.

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But Machan doesn't even look at him.

368
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Even when he gets close to the camera, he looks like he doesn't like it.

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He ignores it.

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What's the real thing? Please tell me.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
At the end... that's right.

372
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Ah, I'm that kind of person.

373
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm that kind of person who looks at the viewers and...

374
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm that kind of person who sucks up to them and...

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No, it doesn't matter when you're talking in the ending.

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
When you're done and the show is over,

377
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and everyone is going to the side,

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the camera is facing you.

379
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can go home like that.

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't need that kind of thing.

381
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It doesn't matter.

382
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Why?

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Eh?

384
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Why?

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's already over.

386
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When the camera turns, it's the end.

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't act like you're cute.

388
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're trying to look cute.

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's obvious.

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't point your finger.

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's obvious.

392
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't point your finger.

393
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Really.

394
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
When the camera is facing you,

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you'll Krishna how the staff is doing.

396
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Then the camera is facing you.

397
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't need that.

398
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's already over.

399
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If it's an ending, I wouldn't eat it.

400
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't eat it.

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't need that kind of thing.

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why?

403
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But you know, there's always a cut, a premeditated cut

404
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll end it here. I wonder if you'll watch it tomorrow as well?

405
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll say, I'm fine, and then there'll be a commercial

406
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And by the time I come back, the commercials are usually like this

407
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll be back soon! And suddenly everyone's like this

408
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's what I don't like

409
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I said, I don't like it! You're doing it for fun!

410
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Eh?

411
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm just barely next to you

412
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's annoying

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I said, I don't like it!

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you go to a commercial again, it'll be normal

415
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Eh?

416
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You know, that...

417
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't do it again!

418
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You'll be in trouble for a long time

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey!

420
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You'll be in trouble

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What are you talking about?

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Eh?

423
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're close! You're the next good friend, the premeditated cut, and you won't go wild

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

425
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Make a promise here

426
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What promise?

427
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
When everyone's like this, you'll be in trouble

428
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How?

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Tamori-san will be next to you, and you'll be right next to him

430
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What are you doing?

431
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Right?

432
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's annoying

434
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you don't like it

436
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you understand?

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Eh?

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The last one

439
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Adachi-kun, Machan and Hama-chan, is there anyone you don't like to be called by your name?

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Ah...

441
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No, I don't think so

442
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But I don't really like it

443
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Eh?

444
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
When I'm called

445
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When you say I'm a bad guy, I get a little angry

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ah, but that's not true

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But you know, when I was in Osaka, there was a car going south, in front of the Hori-ren

448
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And the woman was in the front seat, and she said,

449
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Ah, it's Hama!

450
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's not true

451
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Men are the ones who smile and say, Ah, it's Hama!

452
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So I thought, is there anything wrong with being a man?

453
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You're good

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're flamboyant

455
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle

456
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know that

457
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But sometimes...

458
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ah, I'm not calling you by your name, but

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
From elementary school to middle school, there was a guy who bullied me

460
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Morioka

461
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a little different from calling you by your name, but

462
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That bully, bully, bully Morioka

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
When I was about 20, I met him

464
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's been a while

465
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But I'm an adult now

466
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In the past, I was bullied

467
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
A man who became a good man, I met him on the street

468
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can't bully him again

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
In the past, I thought, let's just let the water flow

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But Morioka came from the other side

471
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I said, Yes!

472
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And then Morioka

473
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Then Morioka replied, Yes!

474
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This made me angry

475
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's what happened

476
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The water flowed

477
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Even if the water flowed, I would still be called by you

478
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Then what should I call Morioka?

479
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We're the same age and we're in the same class

480
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Why?

481
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's...

482
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why?

483
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What's wrong with you?

484
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't care

485
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'd be angry if Morioka did that

486
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know what Morioka is

487
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What Morioka?

488
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know what that is

489
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Come here, Morioka

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You bullied Morioka, didn't you?

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I didn't bully him

492
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You did

493
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What?

494
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You did

495
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Morioka is bad

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why?

497
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He has a lot of things to bully

498
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He plays and suddenly goes home

499
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He goes home

500
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's annoying

501
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He plays and suddenly goes home?

502
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He doesn't say anything about going home

503
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's annoying

504
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't know what Morioka is

505
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He goes home

506
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Morioka is stupid

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Morioka is poor

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Morioka is poor

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's ridiculous

510
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Everyone gathers at the birthday party

511
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Everyone

512
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Minicar

513
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Everyone gives presents

514
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Everyone gathers at Kyoudo's house

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't know

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Kyoudo

517
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He seems rich

518
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Everyone gathers

519
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Kyou-chan, I'm a minicar

520
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Kyou-chan, I'm a...

521
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I only know Takasu

522
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Robot

523
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Everyone gathers around 1000 yen

524
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Morioka is poor

525
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He wants to be late

526
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He wants to be late

527
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Morioka is poor

528
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He wants to be late

529
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If you open the door, Morioka will come from the other side

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's why he walks

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Why is it Sparta X?

532
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Morioka is beaten and walks

533
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is Morioka's birthday present?

534
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't have money, so what do I want to bring?

535
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Kyou-chan

536
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Two pencils

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hello, I'm Emil

538
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Nice to meet you

539
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's time for Kin-chan's photo album

540
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes

541
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's talk about the idea

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There were some ideas

543
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Really?

544
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There were some ideas that we could improve

545
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This time, we will definitely participate in the main event

546
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The other day, when I went to drink at Roppongi, I met the producer of Kaso Taisei

547
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes

548
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I asked him

549
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This time, we will participate in the main event

550
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you for the other day

551
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Next time, we will participate in the main event

552
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Thank you

553
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Kyou-chan

554
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes

555
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What about the other side?

556
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I will do it

557
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm going to close my eyes

558
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This time, I will do it

559
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You will do it

560
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You used to smile

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Which side?

562
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I will do it

563
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I will do it like this

564
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't know if it will be helpful

565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes

566
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I will do it

567
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I will definitely participate in the main event

568
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I will do my best

569
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Everything will be the same

570
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Please look forward to it

571
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Please look forward to it

572
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Please look forward to it

573
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please look forward to it
