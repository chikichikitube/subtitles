1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the first episode, we're going to have a chiki-chiki-hustler game!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You've been doing this since you were a kid, and now you're doing it again.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, really? I have two parents and two children.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're lying!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
When I did something bad when I was little, they made me four times bigger.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And they made me a master at the top.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're a fool.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today, we're going to have a game of billiards.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Look behind you, just like the numbers.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You see this box?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you drop the same number as the number in this box, you'll get the same number as the number in this box.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's the system.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I see.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So you drop it from the number you want?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can drop it from the number you want.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you want it, you don't bother your opponent.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's a skill.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
By the way, the number you dropped will be taken home today.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a promise.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In this rain.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In this rain.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I got it.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No matter what you get, you have to bring it home.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I got it.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you drop the same number as the number in this box...

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a handball.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you drop the same number as the number in this box...

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Here it is.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Nitta Atsuo.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Nitta Atsuo.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nitta Atsuo.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nitta Atsuo.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All the staff, including us, will be hit by Nitta Atsuo.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
First, I'll drop the number one.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Boiled octopus.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll give you this.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is so delicious that my throat is bleeding.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a lie.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll drop the number two.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But this is...

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is...

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's good.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You don't bother your opponent.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I'll give you a bonus.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think it's good.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll drop the number three.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll give you this.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's cheap and good quality.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a gift.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll give you a big camera.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll give you a big camera.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's number four?

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ta-da!

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll give you soy sauce for a year.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll give you a big camera.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is so good.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll give you soy sauce for a year.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll drop the number five.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is wonderful.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a sponsor of the program.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a single malt whiskey from Scotland.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is a single malt whiskey from Scotland.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll drop the number six.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll give you a love-hate relationship.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll drop the number seven.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll drop the number six.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's this?

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's this?

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll give you two flowers.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think every Japanese wants this.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll drop the number eight.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll drop the number eight.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ta-da!

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's this?

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's this?

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is a gift.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll grill you.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll drop the number nine.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What's this?

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is open.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't need the number eight and nine.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll drop the number eight.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll drop the number eight.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What's this?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is number two.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll give you a T-shirt.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This doesn't get in the way.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Stop getting in the way.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll show you my miracle shot.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Are you surprised?

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The number eight was about to get in.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Grandma has been in the way.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Grandma is number eight.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When I'm in trouble, I'll call her grandma.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Grandma must have been very tired in the past.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Grandma must have been very tired in the past.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll take you home.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is for you.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is for you.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is for you.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll aim for the number eight.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is for you.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is for you.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll put the number six in my pocket.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This doesn't get in the way.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This doesn't get in the way.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This doesn't get in the way.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is for you.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have six and seven, so I have two.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I won.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll give you a camera, a T-shirt, an octopus.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll take them all home.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm going home.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Take them all home.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hitchi from Hichimen-cho.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't say Hitchi.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
My name is Umekichi.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why Umekichi?

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm your grandma.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll take you home.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a long trip, but take care.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Shall we go together?

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I wonder if the skin of Osaka fits.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What should I do with Hichimen-cho?

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll send you.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Grandma, let's go.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm old, but I'm free.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll find a seat myself.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I got a towel.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is a flower.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is for you.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a promise, so take it.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm a little angry.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Wait a minute.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Wait a minute.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait a minute.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait a minute.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Wait a minute.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wait a minute.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You stand up and make a circle.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You guys.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's what my brother did.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's funny on TV these days?

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't watch much.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's popular to watch TV dramas.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I like anime.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey, but the anime is really popular in Japan right now!

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know what anime is, don't you?

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm not an idiot.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know what anime is, don't you?

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right! Chibi Maruko-chan!

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've never thought of laughing at an anime like that.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're an idiot.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm just saying, Chibi Maruko-chan,

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Isn't that from yesterday and today?

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's been about a year since I read a word book and liked it.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But that's all in the manga, isn't it?

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Chibi Maruko-chan?

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's about it, isn't it?

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's a memory I almost forgot when I was a kid.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What the hell are you talking about?

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's like the stupidity of my childhood is almost forgotten.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Children are stupid.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's interesting.

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Children are really stupid, aren't they?

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was talking about it yesterday.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When I was a kid, my dad said,

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's hot in summer, so I'll put a blanket on.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Your dad said that all of a sudden, didn't he?

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He wasn't that kind before.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He said it all of a sudden.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He put it in front of the blanket.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He runs around like this.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought I was going to be dumped.

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought I was going to be dumped from today on.

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Really.

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right?

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
When I was a kid, I looked like this.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I didn't look like I was going to be dumped.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was going to be taken somewhere.

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But on my way home, I looked like this.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I thought I was going to be dumped.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know if you're going to be dumped or not.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I thought I was going to be dumped.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's not true.

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I think children are stupid.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Even if it's such a small thing.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's what Chibi Maruko-chan thinks.

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Someday, I'm going to publish a comic book.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My comic book.

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Your English is good.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your English is good.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My English is good.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, really.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What?

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Your reactions are amazing.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Someday, I'm going to publish a comic book.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Really?

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm working hard.

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's quite difficult.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why?

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The comic book.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why?

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've published a comic book before.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That one.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Manga Dojo.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why?

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I've published two-page manga.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There was one that was published by the general public.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I published it.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How was it?

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
At least in the bonus corner of Eva and Dan-kichi.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I thought I wouldn't get anything.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't write it.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I didn't write it.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Have you ever published it?

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You wrote it, didn't you?

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There was a comic book about chewing gum and sending it.

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I've published a comic book about the first meeting.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The one on the back of the manga.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The first meeting.

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What did you buy?

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I didn't buy anything.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What did you buy?

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I bought a cigarette-pushed doll.

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I know that.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's a strange one.

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Really?

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's a strange chocolate.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know that.

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a strange chocolate.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I feel sleepy when I feed it to a woman.

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And in the meantime...

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't eat it.

253
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, that one.

254
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I brought various goods.

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

256
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And Kimiga-kun ate a strange chocolate.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How can I sleep?

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And there's something I want to do.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A chocolate that makes a woman excited.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Something you want to do.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to do it.

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is something that a man should do.

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know if it's true.

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is great.

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's do it.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And the glasses are so beautiful.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes.

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you put them on, you can see them.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm serious.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can see them just by taking off your clothes.

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm going to be mad if you do that.

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was written as Marumi-e or something like Marumi-e Scope

278
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I looked at it like this so that the inside of the room looks wide

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I couldn't see anything if there was no hole in the room

280
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I couldn't see anything if there was no hole in the room

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I've thought about a lot of things

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
For example?

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
When I was a kid, I didn't know that I saw 11 PM

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
At that time, it was a tragedy

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I didn't have a room

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
My parents were sleeping in the other room

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It was a glass room

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If there was a TV, what would they be watching?

289
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The light would reflect

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So it was a cardboard

291
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It fit perfectly on the TV screen

292
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It got smaller little by little and became like this

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I didn't notice it

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I was confused because it suddenly came in

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If there was no TV, what would my son do?

297
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He would put something on the TV screen

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, that's true

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I've done a lot of research

300
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I found out that there is a special feature

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's the easiest to make a combination

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's like making a radio with a radio and a cassette

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That was a special feature

305
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There was no such thing

306
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You can add something to the box

307
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It might be popular to add something to the box

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There is something in the box

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You can put something in your mouth and eat it

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It might be a big hit

311
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Idiot

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let me see the postcard

313
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What?

314
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What is this?

315
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What is this?

316
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What is this?

317
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What?

318
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a gift

319
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't know what it is

320
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's not mine

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not mine

324
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's not mine

325
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm sorry

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What is this?

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Where is she?

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Where is she?

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Were you with her?

330
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Really?

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Where are you?

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What is this?

333
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Are you kidding me?

334
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Give it to me

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you know what it is?

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Did you wear a uniform at that time?

337
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
How old were you at that time?

338
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
How many years ago was this?

339
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
More than 6 years ago

340
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You gave me a postcard

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I was the first one

343
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was 22 years old

344
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was in a commercial with Mr. Donuts

345
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you remember?

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't remember

347
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Really?

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't remember

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I remember 2 or 3 girls like this

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you very much

351
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is the ultimate choice

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's do this

353
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If you go to the town

354
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Are you naked with a mask on?

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm naked with a bikini

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm not joking

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm naked with a mask on

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why?

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't think it's embarrassing

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
to be seen naked

361
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Take off your mask

362
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well

363
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't think it's embarrassing

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not ashamed of being seen peeing

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Really?

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm not doing it

367
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not doing it

368
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not doing it

369
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't know if it's funny

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's funny

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't mind being seen peeing

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I just

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Great, you have a strong voice.

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't bear to see you pooping.

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But I don't want to hear you say, mmm.

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For example, I don't want to hear you say, mmm.

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
For example, I don't want to see you pooping.

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't want to see you pooping.

379
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because when I see that, people think I'm a clean person.

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Of course!

381
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you do that, I'll...

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I didn't, but if you do that, I'll...

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll say, ahhh!

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you just go like that, I'll...

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hey, hey, hey!

387
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll say, wait!

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll say, think!

389
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But seriously though...

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If I were you, I'd still be wearing a bikini and walking around barefoot.

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What are you talking about?

392
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't want to see you pooping.

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't want to see you pooping.

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A long time ago, we were two.

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We went into our house.

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We went into our house without telling anyone.

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We didn't go anywhere.

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We were bored, so we lived in an apartment.

400
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Our parents were working, so they couldn't come home until late at night.

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So we locked ourselves in their house.

402
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We didn't want to go to school, so we took a break.

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We thought, let's hide in their house.

404
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So we locked ourselves in their house.

405
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You made a locked door?

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We made a locked door.

407
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Please forgive me for being young.

408
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We went in, and during the day, we watched TV.

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We did a lot of bad things.

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This guy said he wanted to poop.

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So we went to poop.

412
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And this guy said he didn't want to pee.

413
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Right?

414
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This guy pooped like a kid.

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So he pooped like a kid.

416
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So he pooped like a kid.

417
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He pooped like a kid.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This guy also tried to pee, but...

419
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No!

420
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That wasn't pooped!

421
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That guy was conscious and said he didn't want to pee.

422
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He said he didn't want to pee, so he tried to pee with water.

423
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It was like this.

424
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He tried to pee with water.

425
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was like this!

426
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why did you avoid it?

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You didn't even try to pee.

428
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Go away!

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You're in the way!

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Go away!

431
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're in the way!

432
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That guy was conscious and said he didn't want to pee.

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I've never seen anything like that.

434
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If you put it next to the toilet, it's like a rock.

435
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I've never seen anything like that.

436
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You're in the way!

437
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It doesn't smell at all!

438
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It doesn't smell at all.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who said it doesn't smell?

440
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's either the mother finds herself in porn, or the mother finds the porn she finds herself in.

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's either the mother finds herself in porn, or the mother finds the porn she finds herself in.

442
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Hey!

443
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey!

444
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sure you found yourself in porn.

445
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Not yet.

446
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Not yet?

447
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was asked by a friend, so I did it.

448
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What kind of a friend would read porn?

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is the only one I have.

450
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You don't want to see the can, do you?

451
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's right.

452
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll go home and prepare it.

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Now, with this...

454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
If you open it, the can will...

455
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's about it.

456
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's about it.

457
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Isn't there a type of lighter?

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes, there is.

459
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a type of lighter.

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Did you see it?

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's different!

462
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The one before is the one that goes like this, right?

463
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's different.

464
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The shape is different.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's the same thing twice!

466
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is...

467
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is great.

468
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll prepare the right hand.

469
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Is that okay?

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is it.

471
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm stupid!

472
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's about it.

473
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Thank you very much.

474
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Instead of staff G,

475
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
we're going to make some goods.

476
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
For everyone watching on TV,

477
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
we want you to make something like this.

478
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
With that in mind,

479
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
we want you to make something like this.

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We want you to make something like this.

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If it's possible, let's think about it.

482
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's it.

483
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What else?

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What else is there?

485
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's right.

486
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The postcards are always like this.

487
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's right.

488
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm happy with today's corner.

489
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's right.

490
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We'll send you the postcards.

491
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's send them.

492
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
There are many things we want to say.

493
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Please send us more and more.

494
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is that okay?

495
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's do it here.

496
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
In that case,

497
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
all the postcards are here.

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Please send them to us.

499
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We'll be waiting.

500
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
See you next week.

501
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you for watching.
