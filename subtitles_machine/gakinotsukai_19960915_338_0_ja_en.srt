1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Broken Thunder. How far is Broken Thunder?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How far is it? You already know, right?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to buy some mountain climbing goods.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're in high spirits again today.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not in high spirits at all.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
During the season, Machan discovered that there was a mountain climbing tour.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He couldn't be underestimated by the staff.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It seems that the way to buy mountain climbing goods that looks like a tour is the next street.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to go to Tateyama, but it's Tateyama at this time of the year.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That was strange.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then...

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Manager! Manager!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What kind of manager are you?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to climb from the front of the station.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It doesn't matter where you climb.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The mountain is nice.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is about 15 seconds.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tateyama.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Starting with the winter that melts the silver world on one side,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is the longing of climbers through the seasons.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In order to reach Tateyama, Hama-chan arranges mountain climbing goods.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a list of things to buy, right?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And what are the goods that Machan says are usually arranged?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's nothing strange about it.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What are the goods that Machan arranges?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm angry.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Are you angry?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm very angry.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Jopper.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There is no such thing.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There are red and blue Jopper.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Please buy one by one.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is Burikko.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's dangerous when you fall from the mountain, so put it on your shoulder.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's like a sponge.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But it's plastic, isn't it?

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, today is plastic.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What is it?

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is Catherine.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is a dumpling.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you say Catherine, you will be laughed at.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is that so?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you talking about?

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What is this person?

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's like a mountain climber.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Only in Yamada.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There is no such thing, right?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I wonder how to change it.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It was beautiful.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm angry.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You should apologize.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You should apologize.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's okay to apologize.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What kind of shame should I have?

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm angry.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You should apologize.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you saying?

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, that's not true.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Really?

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry, Shio.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't say it.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry, Shio.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Welcome.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I want to go to Tateyama.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
At this time, Tateyama is the best.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tateyama is the best, isn't it?

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Welcome.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to go to Tateyama.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
At this time, Tateyama is the best.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I get off at the station.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll give it to you.

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yamaha is good.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is this?

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jopper.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Jopper.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Red Jopper and...

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Red Jopper and blue Jopper.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is it.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And...

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jopper.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Jopper.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Jopper.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How many?

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's so small.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can't even put it on a plate.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is plastic.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Plastic.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There are two types.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And...

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Dumplings.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Dumplings.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Dumplings.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I know the name.

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Cassidy.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is it.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is the flow.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's good like this.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In the meantime, Yamaha is good.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yamaha is really good.

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I understand.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's like you're motivated to make a video.

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm not motivated.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Are you a middle-aged man?

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm the one who's cool.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm not a middle-aged man.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hamada-san.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If it's like that, I'll send you a message.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
According to what I heard, this store only sells two.

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are you okay?

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm okay.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm the one who's going.

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then stay with me.

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's go.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Nothing has changed.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Can you hear my voice?

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can hear it.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a good song.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's why I'm going up the mountain.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going with these legs.

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As a feeling.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I understand.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go.

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yamaha is good.

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a rock climbing store.

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yamaha is good.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yamaha is good.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yamaha is good.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's the first time.

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What?

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I want to go to Tateyama.

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to go to Tateyama.

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
At this time, I want to go to Tateyama.

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He's laughing.

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't call the manager.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Manager.

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you the manager?

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No.

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The manager is not here today.

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He's at the exhibition.

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know Yamaha, right?

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I want to go to Tateyama station.

161
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Tateyama station.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Tateyama station.

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes.

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tateyama station.

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It seems that Tateyama station is far away.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's better to be away from Tateyama station.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Be away from Tateyama station.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Be away from Tateyama station.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look at various things.

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yamaha is good.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Joppa.

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Can you give me Joppa?

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Joppa.

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I want to get a dumpling.

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll give you a dumpling.

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please give me a dumpling.

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Excuse me.

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Please give me a dumpling.

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A dumpling.

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please go to the store that sells dumplings.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Laugh.

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Laugh.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a cushion.

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a cushion that you can put on your shoulder when you fall.

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right.

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yamaha is good.

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yamaha is good.

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Laugh.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a cushion.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yamaha is good.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's better to speak in a loud voice.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's a cushion.

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yamaha is good.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a cushion.

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a cushion.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a dumpling.

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a dumpling.

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's been a long time since I've been in Yamaha.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I hate it.

203
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Laugh.

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The general customer is laughing.

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Laugh.

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Laugh.

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Laugh.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Laugh.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Laugh.

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Laugh.

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Laugh.

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Laugh.

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Laugh.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Laugh.

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Laugh.

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Laugh.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Laugh.

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Laugh.

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Laugh.

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Laugh.

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Laugh.

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sweating.

223
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't like it.

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't like it.

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, I see.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm embarrassed.

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Um...

228
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did one of you die?

229
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, why are you in such a good place?

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Huh?

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Did you take a bath?

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where did you go?

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I left something in the vase.

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why are you dying here?

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I left something in the vase.

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You imitated me.

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't like it.

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Will you apologize to me?

240
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll apologize to you.

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There are many things.

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you watch the game last week?

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I went climbing today.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Look at the result.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's been a long time since I've been embarrassed.

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hey, your intonation is strange.

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's dirty.

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You couldn't say such a thing in the previous simulation.

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can understand it.

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can understand it.

251
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Can you give me a dumpling?

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you give me a dumpling, I'll eat it.

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That was the opposite of my father.

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ask me anything.

257
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If you want to do something new.

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never said I didn't know when someone asked me something.

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm serious.

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're pretending.

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm serious.

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can move the jumbo jet.

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What?

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you want to say?

265
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you know this story?

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There are three pilots.

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They don't eat the same food before the flight.

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Really?

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why?

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If they eat the same food, who will control the plane?

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not that easy to understand.

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know how to stand.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Everyone knows that.

274
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Tell me something you don't know.

275
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Ayami, stop it.

276
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Tell me something you don't know.

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Everyone knows how to eat.

278
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I have a lot of knowledge.

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you want to control the plane, tell me how to do it.

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you call it a cockpit?

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We call it a cockpit.

283
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's just a name.

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Cockpit.

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How do you get into a cockpit?

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't want to get in.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can't get in when you're on the plane.

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can get in.

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, no, no.

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There's another place you can get in.

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No, I can't get in.

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No, you can't get in.

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There's a door in the back.

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can't get in from the same place.

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can get in.

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can't get in.

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
At that time, the cook cooks.

298
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The captain eats.

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The cook cooks.

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The captain eats.

301
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When everyone finished eating, the captain said,

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Everyone is ready.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why are you talking like a master?

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's true.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Everyone finished eating.

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, really?

307
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What are you doing?

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't put it in.

309
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What are you doing?

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you a keyboardist?

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You put a line in such a place.

312
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll be right there.

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's a big deal.

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's how it is.

315
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's how it is.

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you came later and everyone was in the same place,

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know where you would be.

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There's a door next to it.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When you say it at home,

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's a door like that.

321
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then...

322
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's like this.

323
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's the opposite of fame.

324
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What am I doing?

325
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, it's stupid.

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Which one do you do first?

327
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
First, you have to start with the voice recorder.

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You have to record it.

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm recording it here.

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's right.

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
First of all, you have to operate the voice recorder.

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You can't talk.

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's why, well...

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Wait, wait, wait.

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's the same old story.

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You have to push it.

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a plane.

338
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't have a gacha.

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Shut up, shut up.

340
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you make a mistake, you won't be pushed.

341
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's just a plane.

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're being pushed at the same time.

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's like yesterday.

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You turned on the switch, didn't you?

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I turned on the switch.

346
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are you going to do with that?

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, that's the inside of the plane.

348
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Wait a minute.

349
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

350
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's right.

351
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
From the top.

352
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It depends on the plane.

353
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What kind of plane is that?

354
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's a 727.

355
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's so old.

356
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Boeing 727.

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That was when I was in elementary school.

358
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's still flying.

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's like this.

360
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What's the weather like now?

361
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Is the weather sunny?

362
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's like this.

363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's like this.

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's like this.

365
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Do you understand?

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How do you start the engine?

367
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
How do you start the engine?

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What?

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When you start the engine, you're already excited.

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's a very important job.

371
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you're in a car, you have to start the engine.

372
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not as easy as driving a car.

373
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's right.

374
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How do you start the engine?

375
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
First of all, there's a lever here.

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's a lever.

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's a wire-like lever.

378
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You pull it like this.

379
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's a lever here, too.

380
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You pull it like this.

381
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What are you doing?

382
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What are you doing?

383
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That makes the wings look good.

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's manual work to make the wings look good.

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's a little saggy.

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's saggy.

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's saggy.

388
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's just a way to do it.

389
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's difficult.

390
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can't do it with wings.

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You can't do it with wings.

392
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You can't do it with wings.

393
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes, yes.

394
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes, yes.

395
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There's a way to do it.

396
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There are a lot of buttons.

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You have to lower all of them.

398
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's a mixer.

399
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a mixer.

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You have to lower all of them.

401
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You have to lower all of them.

402
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I have to make the voice recorder on the B side.

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can do that until it works.

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's 60 minutes.

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not flashy.

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's just moving.

407
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're going to make it on the B side?

408
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If it doesn't work, it won't be flashy.

409
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You can't erase everything.

410
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The one you recorded before.

411
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to leave the last song.

412
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's good.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I have a request for Mr. Matsumoto who won the National Nutrition Award.

414
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Please dance a touching dance that will make the audience cry.

415
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Did you win the National Nutrition Award with a touching dance?

416
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

417
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Every year, I'm invited to the award ceremony.

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you go every year?

419
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's a marriage ceremony.

420
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you go to dance a touching dance?

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes, I do.

422
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you cry when you see me?

423
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes, I do.

424
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm not the kind of person who only offers laughter.

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not like that.

426
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't care. Just dance.

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Open your mouth wide.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Open your heart.

429
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What?

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What?

431
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's all I have to say.

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This year, this season has come again.

433
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's a nonsense speech.

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's Komatsu-san's speech.

435
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Who is Komatsu-san?

436
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Komatsu Masao-san's speech.

437
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No way.

438
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This season has come again.

439
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Every year, I'm invited to the award ceremony.

440
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What?

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm not the kind of person who only offers laughter.

442
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm not the kind of person who only offers laughter.

443
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm not the kind of person who only offers laughter.

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What kind of costume are you wearing?

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm wearing a short-sleeved shirt on my back.

446
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Are you crying because of that?

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm wearing a kimono.

448
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's right.

449
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm wearing a kimono.

450
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Are you hiding your face?

451
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm hiding my face.

452
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're hiding your face.

453
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Your face is creepy.

454
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I can't cry.

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're fast.

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What's the funniest movie you've ever seen?

457
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What do you mean?

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Tell me the funniest movie you've ever seen.

459
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

460
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Tell me the funniest movie you've ever seen.

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm suddenly angry.

462
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Tell me the funniest movie you've ever seen.

463
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Tell me the funniest movie you've ever seen.

464
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
A battle without justice.

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A battle without justice.

466
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Was it funny to watch a few movies?

467
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Komatsu Masao.

469
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Komatsu Masao.

470
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's all for today.

471
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This season has come again.

472
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

473
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm going to cry.

474
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's great.

475
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm going to cry.

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hey!

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I have a question for Matsumoto.

478
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I was trying to get in a cab the other day, but I passed it by.

479
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
How can I get a taxi driver to notice me?

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Is that possible?

481
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
How can I get a taxi driver to notice me?

482
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It can't be that you don't notice.

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It can't be that you don't notice.

484
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's a driver's license.

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's right.

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There's no doubt about it.

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm coming and I'm doing this.

488
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's right.

489
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't like that.

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If the road at Tokyo is a U-turn, you can't get in.

491
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is that so?

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's right.

493
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I would have asked him to pick me up.

494
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Really?

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If it was Osaka, he would have told me.

496
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Really?

497
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He would have told me.

498
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Tokyo is a place like that.

499
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It is.

500
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's go.

501
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
JR Inashimono's...

502
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What? A radio?

503
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What?

504
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This is a good thing sometimes.

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was very excited.

506
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I was about to sing a song.

507
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I was very excited.

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
JR Inashimono has 80% of the shares of the Japanese stock market.

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If he had 80% of the shares...

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What?

511
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The other day, I was about to catch the Shinkansen.

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The door closed in front of me and I had to leave.

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is there a way to catch the Shinkansen at that moment?

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Of course.

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is there a way?

516
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Of course.

517
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
In what condition?

518
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I was running.

519
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You were running.

520
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I was singing.

521
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And?

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I didn't know if I would make it in time or not.

523
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The door closed in front of me.

524
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The door closed.

525
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I went inside.

526
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It was terrible.

527
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I wanted to get inside.

528
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The Shinkansen started to move.

529
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It was moving.

530
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Even if the Shinkansen started to move, I could stop it.

531
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Is that so?

532
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes.

533
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Please tell me.

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
First of all, I tickle the heart of the Shinkansen.

535
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The pride of the Shinkansen is high.

536
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I think I'm the best at everything.

537
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I tickle it a little.

538
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I see.

539
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When the pride of the Shinkansen started to move, I didn't think it was that fast.

540
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What?

541
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm a Shinkansen.

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What?

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I didn't think so.

544
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The pride of the Shinkansen is high.

545
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I was surprised.

546
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I saw the round part.

547
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,000
When the round part of the Shinkansen started to move, the door opened.

548
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Please stop it.

549
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is it that fast?

550
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I was worried about my mother.

551
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I got a call from my father this morning.

552
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
His wife passed away this morning.

553
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll knock it down.

554
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What did you bring?

555
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Did you bring a car?

556
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The round part of the Shinkansen is high.
