1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He's a fool

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh really?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What happened?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going on a date with an Australian today

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was on the phone in the car

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello? Hello?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Loretta?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Loretta?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Loretta? Me? Me?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hosei-kun

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He's a fool

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He's a fool

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What should we talk about?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're not in a situation to ask me to sign

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It happens

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was in the rehearsal of the drama

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was in the middle of the rehearsal

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was doing that look look

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was doing that look look

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There were a lot of old ladies

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Once again, Barbara was doing the rehearsal

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's dangerous

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's dangerous

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I came out of the bathroom

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My daughter is a fan

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is the opposite side

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The two of them were holding me like this

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was a little embarrassed

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was wondering if they would sign for me

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's impossible now

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What are you doing?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You have to say something like that

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't say it

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't say it

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I can't say it

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't say it

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't say it

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can't say it

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can't say it

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If I were an amateur

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I would probably go

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When I was in middle school

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
When I came to the baseball field in my hometown

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right?

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was like

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Please sign for me

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Right?

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't say it now

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're running away

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I said it calmly

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I would go when I was an amateur

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I would go when I was an amateur

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't say it now

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't say it

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
On the way to the field

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was walking on this sidewalk

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Pei-san and Parko-san were walking

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No one was looking at me

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's hard for anyone to walk

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
After the shoot today

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When I came in the car

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was the car in front of you

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was waiting for the traffic light

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I couldn't stand it

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
When I went down and went into the public toilet

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wow, it's a beach

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I went into the public toilet

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I came out and walked

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm just an old man

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't have a nose or a tongue

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't have a tongue

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't stand it

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's hard for anyone

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I finally found a hobby

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's a good thing

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll do this

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A star-seeing party

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What is a star-seeing party?

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is a star-seeing party

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This party is a birthday party

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a party

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A star-seeing party?

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a star-seeing party

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to do this

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
With your bare hands?

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, with a telescope

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course I want it with bare hands

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What am I?

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm a junkie

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You think that's old

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll look at a telescope

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're trying to do something with a telescope

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're trying to buy a telescope

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, no, no

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm just looking at the stars

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm looking at the stars

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And the stars are being looked at by the stars

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But it's strange that you're looking at the stars by yourself

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, no

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've been thinking about it

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Not only looking at the stars

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But also holding the stars against the shutter

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Holding them against the shutter?

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you taking pictures?

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes, I'm taking pictures

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've been thinking about it

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a lot of fun

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When I take a picture

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I take a picture with oil

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You take a picture while looking at the stars

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes, I take a picture with oil

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes, I take a picture

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then I write an image song about it

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's a lot of work

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We have a great system

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We do it with a camera

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We're almost always there

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Making sounds

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Making sounds

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And when I'm done with this

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm done with the sound

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So I'll add salt to it

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And make it into a song

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And then my hobbies

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
They're all over the place

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No, no, no

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There are a lot of big differences between you and me

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example, looks

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The length of your legs

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There are a lot of differences

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're completely different

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The length of my legs

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you know the length of my legs?

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is a hidden part

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
My legs are really long

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is a serious story

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A stylist asked me to measure my legs

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I measured my legs

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The next day I got a call

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They asked me to measure them again

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I said, that's not possible

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're Japanese, right?

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I came back to measure them again

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I said, ah, I knew it

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I wasn't wrong

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But looking at your legs

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It doesn't look long

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No matter how you look at it, you're normal

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's completely different

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm more of a man than you think

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, no, no

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm more of a man than you think

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm more of a man than you think

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't know much about this

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But if I lift this up

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's about 1,000 yen

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Really?

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, really

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No way

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's over here

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Even if I lift this up

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Nothing will change

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No, no, no

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Touch it

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What?

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Touch it

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wait, wait

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't do it like this

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What do you mean, touch it?

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then touch my a**

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why?

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But I can tell

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then don't look

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Look at it with your eyes

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Don't trust your eyes

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Look at it with your eyes

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look at my a**

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hurry

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hurry and look at my a**

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's what I'm saying

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You shouldn't look for hobbies

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can't do this forever

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Birdwatching or something

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What's so funny?

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're an idiot

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
In the past

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's like a bird made by humans

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It was born from humans

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Wild birds are more

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's no difference

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They look the same

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They're rougher

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't care if they're rougher

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They have a rough personality

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't tell

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They have a rough personality

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They have a rough personality

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The birds in the past are rougher

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can understand that

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The birds in the wild are rougher

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't care

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They're always rougher

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't care

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't care

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Even if they talk to you?

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't care if the world is rougher

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't care

216
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They're rougher

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They kick you

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want to see that

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They kick you

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I don't care

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Even if the birds kick me

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't care

224
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Last time, Mr. Matsumoto announced

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The world's 3 most handsome men

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This time, he's announcing

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The world's 3 most sad things

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For example

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Of course you can't be in the top 3

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But at home, you know

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When you watch TV

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When you're lying down

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And there's an ass in front of you

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What kind of probability is that?

235
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If you're lying down in a dressing room

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And there's an ass in front of you

237
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What kind of probability is that?

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Whose ass is that?

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Whose teacher is that?

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Whose teacher is that?

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know that

242
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When you're at home

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's nothing but yourself

244
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That must be sad

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're living alone

246
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
When you have a sore throat

247
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You get a high fever

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're alone

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You have to do everything by yourself

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You know that

251
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's that

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When you're cleaning

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're cleaning like this

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When you're doing this

255
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When you're doing that

256
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can't handle the vacuum cleaner

257
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's sad

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't say that's sad

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I feel responsible

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's your responsibility

261
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What's the 3 most handsome men in the world?

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The 3 most handsome men in the world

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's what everyone wants to know

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's right

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is not in the book

266
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's not in the 3rd book

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not in the 3rd book

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's the 3 most handsome men in the world

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And the pizza chef

270
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's one thing

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And the foie gras

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's the foie gras, right?

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you crazy?

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're definitely crazy

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why did Mr. Matsumoto refuse to be a member of the Globes?

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Please tell us

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It seems like you've been waiting for a long time

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Komuro-san's way of inviting me

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He's so annoying

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He's so arrogant

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He's always asking for my phone number

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What are you doing today?

283
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing today?

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He's always calling

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's always calling

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He's always calling my phone

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He's always calling my phone

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Komuro, Komuro

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're really here, right?

290
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I wanted you to be in that picture

291
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't want to refuse

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I thought it was okay

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I thought it was okay

294
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I wanted him to come

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I wanted him to come

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why?

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I said okay

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Komuro-san is okay

299
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But Mark

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's so annoying

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What are you doing?

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I went to eat with Mark

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
With the Globes

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
With the Globes

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Mark was sitting in front of me

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's amazing

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I was surprised

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
When I looked at him

309
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mark was dropping the Coke

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mark was dropping the Coke

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was Mark

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mark dropped it

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I picked it up

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I looked at him

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mark wasn't wearing it

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Mark was naked

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He took it off

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He took it off

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He took it all off

320
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When did Mark become like that?

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't know

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He took it off

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He took it off

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He took it off

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I thought he would come

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I thought he would come

327
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I thought he would come

328
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I thought he would come

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Where is he?

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Where is he?

331
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In Komuro-san's office

332
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He pretended to pour the tea

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And came in

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This program was brought to you by the sponsors
