1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Supercar

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Camaro

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you want this, it's worth 100,000 yen

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's 100,000 yen

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It will be on air on the 25th

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It will be on air on the 25th

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't do it

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can't do it

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't do it

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I understand

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want to do it myself

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The first time at Gaki no Tsukai

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Chikichi

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Christmas special Super star Matsumoto

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Super Kamaro Dream Jumbo Auction

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good afternoon

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Today, 500 people have gathered

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you very much

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There are a lot of people, so it's a lottery

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Even if it's a lottery, you can only choose 20 people

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, the Super Kamaro will appear

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's go

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is the Kamaro with the Kobe number

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Before the auction, let me check

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
First of all, I'm breathing

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No no no

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is different

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is it?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is my calculation

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What? Calculation?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is my calculation

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Did you do it?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Originally this was a white Kamaro

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He made it a plastic model

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The plastic model is about to break

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I did something I didn't want to do

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who did it?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This guy

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This guy?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This guy

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Matsumoto-san, your nose is coming out

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you want to call the number, please come in

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't have a tanuki anymore

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
From the beginning?

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I knew it when I saw it

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That is no

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That is no

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No. 244

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This guy

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Come here

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's not here

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wait

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is he coming now?

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm Yonezawa

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yonezawa?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How old is Yonezawa?

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm 26 years old

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What did Yonezawa do today?

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He paid for the meal

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He paid for the meal?

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He paid for the meal

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ito Yokado group

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
433,200 yen

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's decided

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wait

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's fast

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There are 19 people left

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can keep it

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't give it to me

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You look good with a straight face

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Next, 285

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a woman

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Please come to the center

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What are you?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Body?

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Product

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can I look at Matsumoto-san?

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sure

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Please don't show this on TV

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is really bad

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you a photographer?

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should be outside

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm having fun

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What is it?

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When I was 15

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When you were 15?

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was a social worker

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you a social worker now?

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because you are a foreigner

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You were too fast

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because you are a foreigner

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What is this?

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What should I call you?

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What is this?

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are a boy

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was a big boy

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's so hard

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to see it

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
325

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It doesn't mean that

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's 325

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
325

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's 325

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's 325

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Here you are

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I got this from the matcha house

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The sleeping bag you threw away

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I threw away the sleeping bag

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why do you have it in his hand?

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was working at Matsumoto-san's house

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You were working at a shipping company

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did you steal the sleeping bag?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You are a criminal

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No.124

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is your name?

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm Asaba

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Asaba-san

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you going to do today?

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to wear the leather coat of Silver Fox

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The leather coat of Silver Fox

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I brought it

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How much is it?

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I think it's about 1 million yen

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
1 million yen?

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But I

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm going to wear it

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Look

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sure it's 1 million yen

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No way

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is good

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Please wear it

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I can't stand it

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thank you

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Thank you

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No.305

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is your name?

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm Watanabe

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Watanabe-san

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What is this?

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a present

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is this a present?

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's 1 million yen

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Who is this?

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's my mother

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is your mother a member of the present?

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think it's about 1 million yen

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's definitely not 1 million yen

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think it's okay to eat and wash

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Eat, wash and clean

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is it okay until the end of the night?

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's it

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's scary

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't like it

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How much is the bus?

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you interested?

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
70, 80

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The bus is 78

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's hard

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No.340

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No.340

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is it

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't say that

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are the best

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is heavy

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How much is this?

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I didn't buy it

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It fell

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did it fall?

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't sell things that have fallen

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No.338

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's here

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You look like a person on the spot

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What is it?

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Please

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you really working there?

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm going to do this today

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What is he going to do today?

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He is good at golf

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Golf putter

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Our staff wants this

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please come

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Manager Okamoto

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When I asked him, he said

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to buy it

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's mine

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's not true

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's mine

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I told him to buy it

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He bought it

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did you borrow the parking lot?

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I borrowed the parking lot

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But it's here

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I told him that's not true

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I told him that you are getting bald

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What is that?

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I asked him to return the car

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yamazaki

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I brought a joke worth 100,000 yen

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm going

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Hey, Mr. Matsumoto

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's an elephant

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's the mark of an elephant

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Matsumoto is a natural person

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When I was on the radio

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I got a lot of the same letters

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Shut up

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Shut up

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't go home

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm waiting for you on TV

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't go home

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
First of all

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Sign

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Down down sign

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You wrote this

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is our signature

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
***

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Tomorrow is your day off

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
One day

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Open

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Really?

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
On New Year's Day

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Now

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I will announce

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's Udo

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I've done this before

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I will announce

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Mother

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Mother

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
By the way

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you have a driver's license?

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Mother

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
After this

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I will use various tools

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mother

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
From the first shot of next year's child

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Really?

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I like it

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No one says that

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No one says that

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's like an AD of the program

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Thank you

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Please give me a gift

265
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank you

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's all I can say

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You should have brought it

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't need that

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't need that

271
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't need that

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You should have brought it

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's amazing

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In Omotesando in Harajuku

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's lighted up

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
On Christmas

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
People from the countryside come to see it

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't need that

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you for the Christmas present

283
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Thank you

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The road in front of you is jammed

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because everyone is watching

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I think

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
People from Kanto in Tokyo

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't see beautiful things

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I see

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We were born and raised in Kobe

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Where are you from?

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's right

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm from Kobe

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You were born and raised in Kobe

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm from Amagasaki

298
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you think?

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you want to sing?

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why?

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Why do you want to sing?

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And what are you going to sing?

303
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to ask you a trick

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you look at the night view of Kobe

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you look at things like that

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Nothing is beautiful

307
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If you look at things like that

308
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The bay bridge is beautiful

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't look at it from the outside

310
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You should look at the bay bridge

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why are you looking at the bay bridge?

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What are you going to do if you get swallowed up?

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm being watched too

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's strange

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm hungry

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't look at the grilled rice

317
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're hungry

318
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's strange

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's true

320
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's already Christmas

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Is that so?

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's not the time to do this

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Are you stupid?

325
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it's an ugly couple

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's going to be a big deal today

328
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's an ugly couple

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They might be watching this at a love hotel

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why are you laughing at an ugly couple?

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm laughing because it's an ugly couple

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's an ugly couple

333
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They're talking like a beautiful couple

334
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't hear it

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you drinking something?

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a weird face

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's tasty

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's tasty

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's the same

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's tasty

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's not good

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's not good

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's right

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Today is not a Christmas

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What are you doing?

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I have one at home.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's too much!

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What are you doing?

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What are you doing at home?

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't have any plans.

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
How many do you have?

352
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Last year I bought 5.

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What is that?

354
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You're asking the same price.

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You're asking the same price.

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're asking the same price.

357
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Why are you making a fuss?

359
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No, no.

360
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're obviously betting on me.

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have a question.

362
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
When I asked everyone's opinions,

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
they said,

364
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm going to win.

365
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't know if that's true.

366
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I've already decided the punishment.

367
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you lose,

368
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you'll die.

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm okay with chainsaws.

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm okay with chainsaws.

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm okay with

372
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
going like this.

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm okay with chainsaws.

374
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Like this?

375
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
How painful is it?

376
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's pretty painful.

377
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Painful is...

378
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm thinking about it.

379
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think it's going to be pretty intense.

380
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Really.

381
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What do you mean?

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm really sorry.

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No, really. I don't think so.

385
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't think so.

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If I say something like this,

387
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't know if you can see it,

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but

389
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
an iron man who cooks

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
won an award.

391
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, the other day?

392
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's amazing.

393
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's amazing to watch this program.

394
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Every week, every week,

395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
in front of a stupid customer.

396
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What?

397
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Can I do this?

398
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is definitely

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
more difficult.

400
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I have to get an award.

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, you should

402
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
come out as a guest.

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Why can't I come out?

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm begging you.

405
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Make a big face.

406
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's all.

407
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
At the end,

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
first,

409
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
in front of a stupid customer.

410
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is my partner.

411
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This is my partner.

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Who are you looking at?

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No, really.

414
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's actually funny.

415
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm begging you.

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Did you decide what to do on New Year's Day?

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If I have to go,

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll go to Hawaii.

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll go to Kamenji.

420
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You see,

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
on New Year's Day,

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm going to the wide show.

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When I come out,

424
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
they ask me if it's a party.

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I tell them to bring that kind of energy.

426
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I tell them to bring that kind of energy.

427
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's why I'm here.

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You know, I've been to many places.

429
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've never seen

430
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
a gift like this.

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's rotten.

432
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I can't even send a New Year's card.

433
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't even send a New Year's card.

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Why didn't you send it?

435
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I told you to send it.

436
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you have a New Year's card?

437
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you have a New Year's card?

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes, I do.

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I've never done that.

440
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I know you don't have one.

441
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Why are you looking at my fingers?

442
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why are you looking at my fingers?

443
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Why are you listening to me?

444
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's like you're saying,

445
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm good at this.

446
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm good at this.

447
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's better.

448
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's better to hang it here.

449
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's a lot of nose hair

450
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
coming out from the right.

451
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There's a lot of nose hair coming out from the right.

452
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So don't say that on TV.

453
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So don't say that on TV.

454
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why?

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I have an image.

456
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
My fans think

457
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't even poop.

458
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think I'm a teddy bear.

459
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think I'm a teddy bear.

460
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're stupid.

461
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
When I get home,

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think I'm doing this.

463
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I think I'm doing this.

464
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I have a good image of my fans.

465
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think I'm a fluffy.

466
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think I'm a fluffy.

467
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Can't you see if I go up?

468
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Can't you see if I go up?

469
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay, then.

470
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Don't say that.

471
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Who told you?

472
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Who said that?

473
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Did it come out?

474
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No, it didn't come out.

475
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Are you stupid?

476
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't say sleepy things.

477
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Why don't you sing?

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why?

479
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Why are the books in the convenience store lined up with glass?

480
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's a promotion.

481
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh?

482
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What do you mean?

483
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm not really interested.

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You know that I'll shake it and you'll be like this, right?

485
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What do you mean?

486
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If you look at the new magazine, you'll see that it's in.

487
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
If you look at it from the outside, you'll see that it's inside.

488
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I see.

489
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's a promotion.

490
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What do you think?

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What?

492
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Machan!

493
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You always say something different.

494
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Stop it!

495
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes.

496
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Recently, Matsumoto-san...

497
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What?

498
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Recently, Matsumoto-san has only been on variety shows and hasn't been on TV.

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Ishihara-kun also came.

500
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't know what to say.

501
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Um...

502
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's because of Ishihara-kun.

503
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
No, no, no.

504
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Originally, it was Ishihara Yujiro and Watari Tetsuya.

505
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
After that, I was number 3.

506
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ishihara-kun followed Yujiro and Watari Tetsuya.

507
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Who was next?

508
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Tachi Hiroshi?

509
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes, yes, yes.

510
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Before that, it was me.

511
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Tachi-kun came after me.

512
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Tachi-kun is already over 40 years old.

513
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Tachi-kun came and I just switched.

514
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You're already Tachi-kun.

515
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Isn't that weird?

516
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What?

517
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
When Yujiro was still alive, he was already there.

518
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yujiro? Why are you talking about Yujiro?

519
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
When the president was there.

520
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
When the president was there.

521
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He was already there?

522
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He was already there.

523
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
When he got sick and was shaking his hand from the balcony, Watari-san was there.

524
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes, yes, yes.

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was right behind Watari-san.

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You're not in the frame!

527
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No, no, I'm not in the frame.

528
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was right behind him.

529
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why are you standing like this?

530
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You should be standing like this.

531
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The president told me not to go out yet.

532
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It was dangerous.

533
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It was me at first.

534
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It was me until episode 2.

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Who was with you?

536
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
With Shibata Kyohi.

537
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Why did it change from episode 2 to episode 3?

538
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The first one was Taka.
