1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first episode of Gaki no Tsutaya is next!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Summer, sea, sunshine, beach tour!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The sun is up.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The sun is up.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
From now on.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's the sea and the pool.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know why the aloha of Endo and the aloha of Suzuki are the same.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They are not the same.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think they are the same.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's go to the beach!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Did you bring it?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, we did.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I brought this too.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I brought it too.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I brought it too.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I brought it too.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I brought it too.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is good.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can we start already?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just a little bit more.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why is it stopped?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's go.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The sun will go down soon.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What is this?

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What?

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What is he doing?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He is carrying a gun.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What?

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He is getting in the car.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't move!

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you move, I'll shoot you.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What are you talking about?

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I took this bus.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why don't you go to the beach?

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I took this bus.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I have a knife.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you don't listen to me, I'll shoot you.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have a knife.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You don't know anything.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What are you talking about?

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go to the beach.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't want to go to the beach today.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What?

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't treat people well these days.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't care.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you move, I'll shoot you.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't treat people well these days.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I want to improve my image.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to do something cool today.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I thought about it.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't move!

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll shoot you.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You shot me.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What is it?

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to improve my image.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going to do something cool.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why?

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've been a bad guy.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When I was a Napoleon, when I was a king,

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When I was a king,

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I was a bad guy.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to show you a cool me.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm setting up myself.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't do that.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you change the program, it won't work.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to go to the beach.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't want to go to the beach.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll go to the beach.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think you know it.

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not good at it.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't want to go to the beach.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to go to the beach.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want you to follow me quietly today.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you follow me, I'll be okay.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A local bus jack.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What made Heipou so violent?

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The problem seems to be his misbehavior as a kid.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And it seems that he has found an unexpected end.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So this time, he put his life on the line.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He set up an image-up plan of his own.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The jacked up members were taken to the scene where Heipou was ready.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What is this?

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll explain from the big rock.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Mr. Kameda, are you ready?

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to do this today.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ta-da!

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A big rock is rolling towards the girl.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A big rock.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Heipou is cool.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is cool.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm going to be a superman and save the girl from this big rock.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's what I'm going to do today.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm going to do the world's Heipou big present.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll stop the big rock in the middle of the road.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Will the world's Heipou big present image-up plan succeed?

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Look at that.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's the real Heipou.

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It has a bell on it.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is Heipou.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to do something with this bell.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a huge set.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The total length is 30 meters, the height is 6 meters, and the diameter of the rock is 2 meters.

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The bell and the theme are all special.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A big rock is rolling towards the girl.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to make a cool image-up plan.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm only going to do it once.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Kameda, are you ready?

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's dangerous.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Can you stop it?

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's cool if you can stop it.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If it's like in the picture, you can stop it like this.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can stop it with one hand.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If you can do that, it's a big success.

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think my wife will laugh.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is that what you're going to do?

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's what I'm going to do.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Image-up, image-up.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Heipou is not laughing right now, so please hold on.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's dangerous.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He's running away.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He's coming.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm a superman, so I have to change my clothes.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Heipou, hurry up.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to fall.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hurry up.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's too late.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Heipou, hurry up.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm waiting for you.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's definitely not good.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's just that you're in a hurry.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not in a hurry or anything.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is it?

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It says Saito.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Glasses, glasses.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you for waiting.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's dangerous.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's dangerous.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What are you going to do?

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You can't run away.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's too big.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's too fast.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've never seen a girl like that.

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I understand. I'll do it again.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll do it again.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I understand.

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll set it up again.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The talent is waiting.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hurry up.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm going.

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I want you to run away.

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's coming.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's scary.

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm scared.

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm scared.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's too late.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll do it again.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Really?

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You just threw it.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I didn't throw it. I protected it.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I didn't protect it.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at it.

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I protected it.

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I didn't protect it.

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hurry up and put it up.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Please do it again.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Really?

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Please do it again.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't do it anymore.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do it again.

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Saito, do your best.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I understand.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't do it.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't want it to come out like this.

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You don't want it to come out, right?

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't want it to come out.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We'll start the show.

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's coming.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's coming.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's coming.

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's coming.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's coming.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's coming.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is this okay?

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The girl fell.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't protect it.

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Are you okay?

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can't go, right?

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You spent a lot of money, right?

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can go home like this.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But for the show...

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Decide.

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't take it off like this.

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Decide.

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't want it to come out.

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Saito, hey!

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You'll get in trouble for that.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
In the face of the ridiculous situation,

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the comedian Yamazaki

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
stands on the battlefield of laughter.

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Take it from the shelf.

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Arushu.

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is Arushu?

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Take Arushu.

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If I go to help you, you can take it off.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If Ooiwa comes.

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know anything about that.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know anything.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm just playing in the park right now.

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm just holding hands.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know anything.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The girl is dangerous.

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know if Ooiwa will come.

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't know if Ooiwa will come.

225
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know if Ooiwa will come.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know if Ooiwa will come.

227
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you look at it,

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's like this.

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I see.

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is this?

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What is this?

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Dangerous.

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dangerous.

234
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hurry up.

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
First of all, Hamada's medicine box.

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Where are you?

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Where are you?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you okay?

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you okay?

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Are you okay?

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It hurts.

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It hurts.

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hello, hello.

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How are you?

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you a little confused?

246
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This year,

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's like that.

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Something like a wind blows.

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know what to say.

251
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you don't say something like a wind,

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Is this story a joke?

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What kind of wind is the problem?

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What kind of wind is the problem?

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But after that,

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's okay because it's big.

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's big.

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's big.

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This year,

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Something like a wind blows.

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It is said that Asia is very hot.

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It is said.

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So it's hot this year.

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's very hot.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's because of the wind.

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's because of the wind.

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I see.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's why I can't help it.

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Really.

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's what it is.

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, that's the end of this story.

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, it's not that bad.

274
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I want you to cut this.

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If you know the name of the wind.

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right.

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
How are you?

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Really, these days.

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think I've said this before.

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think I've said this before.

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think I've said this before.

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think I've said this before.

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But at that time,

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The customer's reaction was very bad.

285
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There's a story I quit on the way.

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What's that?

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not wrong.

288
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I wanted to say this.

289
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Can I say it again?

290
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Please.

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I live alone.

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I do the laundry myself.

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I live alone.

294
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please ask the real estate agent.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I live alone.

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The real estate agent.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's up to you.

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
After that, it's up to you.

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I live completely alone.

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I do the laundry myself.

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I wash my underwear.

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I wash my underwear.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I take off my underwear in the bathroom.

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can take it off anywhere.

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't want to put it in a basket.

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't want to put it in a basket.

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So I put it on the outside.

308
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you understand?

309
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It can be the back.

310
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So I put it on the outside.

311
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I do the laundry.

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I put the dryer in.

313
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I fold it.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's definitely the back.

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm angry.

316
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What do you mean?

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's been turned around a lot.

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I thought so, too.

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's been turned around a lot.

320
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I thought it was fluffy inside.

321
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Once, I put about 10 pieces of underwear on the back.

322
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When I saw it was done, it was all on the back.

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Can you explain this?

324
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If I can, I want to get smaller and put it in the dryer.

325
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I want to see what's going on.

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's the back now.

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's the back now.

328
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's definitely strange.

329
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How can it be like that?

330
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You don't understand, do you?

331
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Look at it from the husband's point of view.

332
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The laundry is pretty weak.

333
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's like a mountain.

334
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I put it on the back and put it on the outside.

335
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If I can shorten this time, how much better is it?

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then the number of meals for the husband who comes back will increase.

337
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's on the outside, so it won't increase.

338
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's not true.

339
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think I can explain that.

340
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I put 10 pieces of underwear on the front.

341
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How many pieces will come out on the front?

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I see.

343
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I think it's definitely strange.

344
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's okay.

345
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't have a hand.

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's like a DVD.

347
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
There are times when even the shirt is turned inside out.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's definitely a lie.

349
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Such a thin shirt is turned inside out?

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know how many times it's turned inside out.

351
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It doesn't matter if it's turned inside out.

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If it's turned inside out, go back once.

353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, go back once and go home again.

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's turned inside out again?

355
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is that?

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, it's a kind of harassment.

357
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's harassment.

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't want to be cut.

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't want to be cut by you.

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What do you mean by that?

361
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Are you going to fight today?

362
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's strange.

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Today's audience reacted well.

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What are you talking about?

365
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think it's because of the atmosphere.

366
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If you watch TV again, you'll think,

367
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
why is he talking like that?

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not like that.

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's got a question about that.

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And he remembers the anger.

371
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And he's trying to solve it.

372
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He has to get angry.

373
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He's trying to make the shirt inside out.

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Can't you make a dryer that doesn't turn inside out?

375
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're going to buy it.

376
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll definitely buy it.

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's going to be a little more expensive than a normal dryer.

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Everyone doesn't buy it.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You don't have to turn it inside out.

380
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You can develop it.

381
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And then you can do it with Project X.

382
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's okay to do it.

383
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's okay to make it.

384
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll do it.

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll think about it.

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
A dryer that never turns inside out.

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm going to release Project X by myself.

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's okay if it comes out.

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's going to be a documentary.

390
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm going to cry a lot.

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Matsumoto dug in 10 sheets.

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I couldn't turn it inside out.

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't want to come out at all.

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I want you to come out.

395
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want you to come out when I make it.

396
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm really angry.

397
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's okay.

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You don't wash it, do you?

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
When I was living alone, I washed it myself.

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm not doing it.

401
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can't do it.

402
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why?

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I've been wearing dirty underwear all the time.

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a carotene.

405
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm going to get a lot of shit on my underwear.

406
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You threw it away, didn't you?

407
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You too, didn't you?

408
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I just remembered.

409
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What?

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't know the weather at that time.

411
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There was a live drama before.

412
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think you were nervous at that time.

413
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It hurts a lot when you're nervous.

414
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I've been nervous since I got home.

415
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm nervous because it's a live drama.

416
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think it's okay.

417
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I went home and I thought it was okay.

418
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It hurts a lot.

419
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think it's not okay at all.

420
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If you were nervous at that time, you wouldn't have felt the pain, would you?

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But I remember.

422
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I remember Chippu.

423
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I remember Matsumoto Chippu.

424
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I remember it, too.

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But I'm not talking about that.

426
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Why aren't you used to the live drama?

427
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I thought you'd talk to me more.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I thought you'd talk to me more.

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Why are you making that face?

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What should I do?

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's right.

432
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When I first talked to Endo, he looked like this.

433
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He talked to Tanaka right away.

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Tanaka, too.

435
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I was looking at you in the middle of the play.

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
When I went out, you hit me.

437
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It was amazing.

438
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I hit you in the neck.

439
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No matter how old you get, you're still young.

440
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
When you get older, you get muscle pain after a day.

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What does that mean?

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Please explain the mechanism of the body.

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is the muscle.

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Simply put, it's aging.

445
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
When you're young, let's say you've done 50 push-ups.

446
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When you're young, if you talk, it hurts.

447
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
From the 49th day, you're like, I'm moving.

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But when you're in your 40s or 50s, you're like this.

449
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When you're in your 50s, you're like this.

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You don't realize it.

451
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm still drinking tea.

452
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The next day, I felt like I was moving.

453
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You have to speak clearly.

454
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can have a laugh with any animal.

455
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Please tell me the difference between a goat and a sheep's cry.

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's a classic writing.

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can't do a goat's cry.

458
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You don't want to do it.

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's a joke.

460
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You can't do a sheep's cry.

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's like that.

462
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Please tell me the difference.

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There's a difference.

464
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Really?

465
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's completely different.

466
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
A goat's cry is like this.

467
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A sheep's cry is like this.

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's like this.

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's like this.

470
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's like this.

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's different.

472
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll ask you.

473
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What's a goat's cry?

474
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
A goat's cry is like this.

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
If you say it in American, it's like this.

476
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's completely different.

477
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Really?

478
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's right.

479
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Really?

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's what I'm saying.

481
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's what I'm saying.

482
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why?

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's what we can hear.

484
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We can't hear it.

485
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You can't hear it.

486
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A sheep's cry is like this.

487
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It doesn't matter.

488
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like this.

489
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
A goat's cry is like this.

490
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You're not a telecom person.

491
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm not.

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
A goat's cry is like this.

493
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Try a lion's cry.

494
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's completely different.

495
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's just a feeling.

496
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's just a feeling.

497
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What are you saying?

498
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
A lion's cry is like this.

499
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I heard it.

500
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
A lion's cry is like this.

501
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Seriously.

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's like this.

503
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No.

504
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's like this.

505
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What about a pig?

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
A pig.

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's the worst.

508
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What did you say?

509
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What did you say?

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
A pig?

511
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Didn't you say that?

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How can you hear a pig?

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's like this.

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's like this.

515
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I said it.

516
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I said it.

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I said it.

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's like this.

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's like this.

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I said it.

521
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Who?

522
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've never said a goat's cry.

523
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They all said it.

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've never said a goat's cry.

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What are you doing?

526
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's weird.

527
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I couldn't hear it.

528
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No.

529
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can't hear it.

530
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No.

531
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's like this.

532
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I didn't say anything.

533
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What?

534
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What if I told you?

535
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sure you'd say it.

536
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No, I'm not.

537
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You have to say it.

538
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No.

539
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You have to say it.

540
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You don't say it clearly.

541
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You have to say it clearly.

542
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's no good if you say it clearly.

543
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You can't say it like that.

544
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
No.

545
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I can't say it that way.

546
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So you mean it.

547
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay.

548
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I think you should doubt Mimi.

549
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But she's basically crying.

550
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I didn't say anything. The cat is meowing, right?

551
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I didn't say anything at all.

552
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The dog is meowing, right?

553
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We've been taught that since we were little.

554
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The American dog is meowing, right?

555
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's fine if it's meowing.

556
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's meowing.

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's true that the American dog meows twice.

558
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It meows once.

559
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It meows twice.

560
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It meows, meows.

561
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's fine.

562
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's fine if it's meowing.

563
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The cat is meowing, right?

564
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's not meowing.

565
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's solve this one by one.

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's do the lion.

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The lion is...

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Do the chicken.

569
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's changed.

570
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's changed.

571
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not changed.

572
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's changed.

573
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do the dog.

574
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's not changed.

575
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So the cat is...

576
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Let's do the cat.

577
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's not the cat.

578
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Let's do the other one.
