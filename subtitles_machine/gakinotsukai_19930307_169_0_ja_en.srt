1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The professional baseball is about to start.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're going to play first.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is the team already decided?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, it's already decided.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is the match team.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm looking forward to this pure white uniform.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The problem is this guy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Don't push your glasses.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is the match team.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the match team.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are a lot of otaku teams that don't look red.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You guys are like that too.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm like this.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a pure white uniform.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm selling it like that.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why is that?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm a little...

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Mario is like a mushroom.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This guy is always in my team.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know why.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I didn't get beaten up today.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's like Irochin's sword.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What is this?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a baseball game, so we have a referee.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Referee, please.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Takahashi will be the referee.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please explain the rules.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
As long as the ball doesn't fall on the ground, it's out.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's out.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's no passing.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to give it back to the referee.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're doing a good job.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm just changing my talent.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a baseball game, so we have a referee.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please explain the rules.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
As long as the ball doesn't fall on the ground, it's out.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's no passing.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You have to give it back to the referee.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're doing a good job.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're doing a good job.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm just changing my talent.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're doing a good job.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm just changing my talent.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're doing a good job.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm just changing my talent.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're doing a good job.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm just changing my talent.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're doing a good job.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're doing a good job.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do your best.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's out.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What were you thinking?

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What are you doing?

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What are you doing?

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's okay.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's okay.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's in.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's okay.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's okay.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's okay.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Referee.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Referee.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What?

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're cheating.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're cheating.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You just hit me.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Referee.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Two strikes.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Two strikes.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're cheating.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're cheating.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're cheating.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're cheating.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're cheating.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're cheating.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You were just using your arms.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're cheating.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're cheating.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to die.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ouch.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're cheating.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're cheating.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're cheating.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You were just using your arms.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're cheating.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's out.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You should hit the bottom.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's a young man.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's out.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait a minute.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He's on your team, right?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait a minute.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Give it to him.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's broken.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's broken.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's broken.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's broken.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's not a matter of the bat. It's a matter of the captain.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a matter of the bat.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a matter of the bat.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a matter of the bat.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Jump!

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The two teams are divided by 11 to 11.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was assigned to the captain of the team.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Captain!

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I didn't know that.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please say something to the captain.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you for your hard work.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The captain is in a bad mood.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The captain is in a bad mood.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He is such a person.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He is such a person.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is laughing a little here.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When he was sulking, he took off his shirt.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When he was sulking, he took off his shirt.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Today is good.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not wearing a jacket.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not wearing a jacket.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I decided to wear a jacket.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Oh, you decided on your own?

126
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Yes, I did.

127
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Oh, I see.

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
There's a man in there, too.

129
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
That's right.

130
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Right?

131
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
There's a man in there, too.

132
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
It'd be nice if there was something in here.

133
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
That's right.

134
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Just a little kid.

135
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Um...

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
The population table...

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Is the population table in Tokyo?

138
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
It is.

139
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, I see. That's right.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have to do that, too.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Um...

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There's a lot of annoying things.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Like, there's a population table.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,500
When you buy something.

145
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,000
You have to go home and get it.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
That's right. That's how it is with me.

147
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
So if your passport runs out,

148
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
you have to go to Kobe.

149
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
That's right.

150
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
It's annoying.

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
That's right.

152
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
And what's annoying is the videotape.

153
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Um...

154
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Why can't you get it at the office?

155
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
There's a lot of people who don't pay at the office.

156
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
They don't pay.

157
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
So...

158
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Um...

159
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
You're so fast.

161
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
No.

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
The driver's license...

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
You're so fast.

164
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
What do you call it?

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
You still have your driver's license,

166
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
but you're still driving.

167
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
No, no, no.

168
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
That's amazing.

169
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
The driver's license is the best proof of military service.

170
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Right?

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Yes, yes.

172
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
There's a reason for that in your neighborhood.

173
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
That's right.

174
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
There's a reason for that in your neighborhood.

175
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
At that time, you were the chief of the police.

176
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
That's right.

177
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
That's no good.

178
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
That's no good.

179
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I don't live there.

180
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
You're angry, aren't you?

181
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm already on fire.

182
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
You're already on fire.

183
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
You have a driver's license.

184
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I have a driver's license.

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
That's weird.

186
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
You're so fast.

187
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
You have a driver's license.

188
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Why?

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
If the other person is a yakuza,

190
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
why can't I drive?

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Because I'm scared.

192
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
That's weird.

193
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
You're asking for proof of living there.

194
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
That's right.

195
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
That's why you go to a video store, right?

196
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You go in and check other videos.

197
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
You haven't become a member yet,

198
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
but you check to see how much stuff there is.

199
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
That's right.

200
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
You look at it and then...

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Especially, you go to a video store centered around adults.

202
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
If there are a lot of adults,

203
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
you think you'll become a member here when it's sunny.

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
That's right.

205
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
The clerk says,

206
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Oh, it's Machan. Please sign it.

207
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Oh, that's fine.

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
You sign it.

209
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I want to become a member.

210
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Oh, really?

211
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Do you have a driver's license?

212
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
If you put it out, it's a ticket to Hyogo.

213
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
That's right.

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
It's no good.

215
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Don't lie to me like that.

216
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
You said it was Machan.

217
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
You don't have to hide or run away.

218
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Suddenly, the relationship gets weird.

219
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
That's true.

220
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
That's true.

221
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
You're angry, aren't you?

222
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm angry.

223
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
You didn't even sign it.

224
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
And then...

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
There's a 24-hour video store.

226
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
If you say 24 hours, you can go there at any time.

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
That's right.

228
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
You don't have to say anything.

229
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Everyone knows.

230
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
When I went in there,

231
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
there were a lot of adults again.

232
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
There was an adult video that I really wanted to borrow.

233
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
I didn't put it anywhere.

234
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
It was there.

235
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
It was there.

236
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I really wanted to become a member.

237
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I didn't go there directly.

238
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I went to Yamazaki.

239
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
I was told it wasn't good.

240
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Yamazaki lives in Kyoto.

241
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
It's not good even in Kyoto.

242
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
I live in the neighborhood, so I can't borrow it.

243
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I looked for some people.

244
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I wanted to borrow it on that day.

245
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
I wanted to see it 100%.

246
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I wanted to see it 100%.

247
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I thought I'd pull it up today.

248
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I thought I'd pull it up today.

249
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I went home.

250
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
When I got to the apartment that day,

251
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I asked them to make me a disciple.

252
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I asked them to make me a disciple.

253
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
I didn't have a disciple, so I couldn't do it.

254
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I wrote a letter and asked them to call me.

255
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I looked at it.

256
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
This is it.

257
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
If I had it, I'd call you.

258
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
If I had it, I'd call you.

259
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
I just wanted to borrow your video.

260
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I still have a letter in my bag.

261
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I still have a letter in my bag.

262
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I still have a letter in my bag.

263
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
You don't trust humans, do you?

264
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I went in and looked at it.

265
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I didn't look at it.

266
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I went to the counter first.

267
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I went in and looked at it.

268
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I went in and looked at it.

269
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I said,

270
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
You're a nasty person.

271
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I said,

272
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I said,

273
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I said,

274
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I said,

275
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I said,

276
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I said,

277
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Humans are cold.

278
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I used to be like that in Osaka, too.

279
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
With a girl, you know,

280
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Well, it was around the time of the year.

281
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
And then my pussy-chan would say...

282
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Your pussy?

283
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
No way!

284
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Ah, your pussy-chan!

285
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Yeah, my pussy-chan.

286
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I had to wear rubber gloves.

287
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
That's fine, isn't it?

288
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
I didn't have any!

289
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
I couldn't help it.

290
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
So I went out to the hotel.

291
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I was walking all the way.

292
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I couldn't stop.

293
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
You wanted to do it, didn't you?

294
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I was walking a little, and there was a hotel.

295
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I couldn't help it, so I went into the hotel by myself.

296
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
And the old lady said,

297
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Do you want to stay overnight?

298
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
So I said,

299
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Ah, your pussy-chan!

300
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm sorry, old lady, but...

301
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Can't you sell it to me?

302
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
It's changed.

303
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I can't do that.

304
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
In the United States,

305
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,500
I was caught by a serial killer.

306
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
What kind of killer are you talking about?

307
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
He's a lolicon.

308
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
That's why he's after a boy in kindergarten.

309
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
A boy in kindergarten?

310
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
What are you going to do with that?

311
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I don't know.

312
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I don't know.

313
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
It hurts, old man, it hurts.

314
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I can't stand it.

315
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
I can't stand that voice.

316
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It hurts, old man.

317
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
It hurts, old man.

318
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Stop it.

319
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:10,500
What are you talking about?

320
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm talking about a foreign country.

321
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm talking about the United States.

322
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
You have a lot of imagination.

323
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
You're cool.

324
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Hey!

325
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,500
I think more than I think.

326
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
That's weird.

327
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,500
It's scary, it's scary.

328
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Let's get rid of it.

329
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Get rid of it.

330
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Why is the girl in Juliana dancing with wings?

331
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
She's not doing it.

332
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,500
She's a girl, but she doesn't complain about being cheated on her way home.

333
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
That's right.

334
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Don't you think?

335
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
That's right.

336
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
She's walking in that outfit on her way home.

337
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
She's being cheated on.

338
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
She's being cheated on.

339
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,500
A cow is walking with iron plate and grilled meat sauce.

340
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
She's being eaten.

341
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
She's being eaten.

342
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
She's saying, ask me.

343
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
That's right.

344
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
It's terrible.

345
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
No, no, no, no, no.

346
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
That's not terrible.

347
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,500
That atmosphere, that lighting, that excitement, it looks good.

348
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

349
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
That's right.

350
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
If you look at each one of them, it's like, wow.

351
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
If you look at each one of them, it's not a big deal.

352
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
That's right.

353
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
That's true.

354
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It's the horror of the group.

355
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
If you're dressed like this in a group,

356
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
If a high school student is wearing a sailor suit and there are about 10 people walking around,

357
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I think they're getting along well.

358
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I want to be surrounded.

359
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
But if you look at each one of them,

360
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
If you look at each one of them, it's not a big deal.

361
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
That's right.

362
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
That's true.

363
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
What is the sign of a celebrity for?

364
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Has anyone ever had one before?

365
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I don't have one.

366
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
But sometimes I can't get it.

367
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
If there's a Shinkansen or something,

368
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
If there's a Shinkansen or something,

369
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
They say, sign it for me.

370
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
They say, sign it for me.

371
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
It's a habit to say, sign it for me.

372
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,500
If you're staying at a hotel and you ask for it,

373
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
If you're staying at a hotel and you ask for it,

374
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
They say, sign it for me.

375
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I've never seen you with such a red face.

377
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
That's a bad idea.

378
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
That's a bad idea.

379
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
You say it and then you say,

380
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You say it and then you say,

381
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I've never seen you with such a red face.

383
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I've never seen you with such a red face.

384
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
The Shinkansen.

385
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,500
The other day, a boy from a school went back to Osaka.

386
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
He said, sign it for me, and I fell asleep.

387
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
And he came to me.

388
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I said, I'm sorry.

389
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I said, I'm sorry.

390
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
He said, I'm sorry.

391
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I said, I'm sorry.

392
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
He said, I'm sorry.

393
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
I said, I'm sorry.

394
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
He said, I have an exam today.

395
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
He said, I'm sorry.

396
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Why did you do that?

397
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
If you say something like that,

398
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm sure you'll get it.

399
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I said, I have an exam today.

400
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
So what?

401
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I can't do that.

402
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
It's not related at all.

403
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,500
It's not like I'm trying to get something on my birthday or exam.

404
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
It's strange.

405
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
It's like the last trump card.

406
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
If you get it, they'll do it for you.

407
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
It's all about timing.

408
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Right.

409
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
It's not like I always get 1,000 yen.

410
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
It's all about timing.

411
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I always leave early in the morning.

412
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I get up early in the morning and go home late.

413
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
They ask me to come home and sign.

414
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
That's how it is.

415
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm sorry.

416
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
That's true.

417
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Also, in letters,

418
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I have to carry my luggage.

419
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I have to carry my luggage.

420
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I have to carry my luggage.

421
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
I have to say thank you.

422
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I have to say thank you.

423
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
That's the end of it.

424
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
My hands are full.

425
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
My hands are full.

426
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I have to bring cigarettes.

427
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I can't do that.

428
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I can't even do that.

429
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
I have to leave cigarettes here.

430
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Okay.

431
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Okay.

432
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I can't do that with one cigarette.

433
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I can't do that.

434
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I'll have to get more cigarettes every day.

435
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I can't believe this.

436
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
There are 3 or 4 packs of cigarettes.

437
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
It's terrible.

438
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Hey!

439
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I can't agree with that.

440
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
The other day, I was listening to Mr. Imada's radio.

441
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Me, Matsumoto-san, and Ritton Chosadan, who are young people, were at a pizza restaurant in Osaka.

442
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,500
We were drinking tea, and we were told by the Osaka team to come out later.

443
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
When we went outside, there were about 20 people on the team.

444
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
There were about 20 people on the team?

445
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
There were about 20 people on the team.

446
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,500
At that time, Matsumoto-san thought that he couldn't do it if he hit him from a talent.

447
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,500
He told the people on the team to hit him quickly.

448
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
That was amazing.

449
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
You're scaring me.

450
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
What are you doing?

451
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,500
You're doing something bad, but you're telling me to hit you quickly.

452
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
You shouldn't think about that.

453
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
If you hit me first, the director of the next day...

454
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I didn't hit you. I didn't do anything.

455
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Why did you hit me?

456
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I didn't do anything.

457
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,500
He didn't do anything, but he told me to come out.

458
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
That's why I said, what are you doing?

459
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
That's why I said, what are you doing?

460
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,500
He said, what am I doing?

461
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
He said, what are you doing?

462
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I thought I had to hit him.

463
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
What are you doing?

464
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
He said that.

465
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
He didn't say anything.

466
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
He said it himself.

467
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
He's the leader.

468
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I'll hit you.

469
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,500
What are you doing?

470
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I'm just kidding.

471
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
There was a 45... what are you doing?

472
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
There was a 45... what are you doing?

473
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
There was a 45... what are you doing?

474
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,500
How did you evolve from 45?

475
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,500
I had to protect the young people.

476
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
That's why I said, hit me.

477
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
What are you doing?

478
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
But if you hit me, I'll make it double.

479
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Say it.

480
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,500
I don't want to say this on TV, but my special move is a cross counter.

481
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
If the opponent doesn't hit me, I can't use that move.

482
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Because it's a cross counter.

483
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I'll use the opponent's hand to do this.

484
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
That's right.

485
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
But he can't use his hand.

486
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Because I'm big.

487
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Wait a minute.

488
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Do you understand if it's a flag?

489
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
No, I'm big.

490
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I didn't say anything.

491
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,500
As a human being, I have a deep feeling.

492
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I feel like I'm being beaten up.

493
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I feel like I'm being beaten up.

494
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I feel like I'm being beaten up.

495
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,500
There are a lot of people who want to brag about hitting a comedian.

496
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm sure there are.

497
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I'm sure there are.

498
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm sure there are.

499
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
I'll tell you.

500
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:43,500
But I can't be proud of it.
