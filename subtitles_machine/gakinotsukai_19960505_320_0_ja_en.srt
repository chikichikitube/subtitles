1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, we are going to have a baseball tournament!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now that the pro baseball tournament has started, the baseball team is going to have a baseball season.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We are going to defend the baseball team.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You are the ace of Gaki Tsukai.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sorry, I should have said it more interesting. I lost to a helicopter.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I thought it was a helicopter.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Did you lose?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I lost, I lost.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry. I'm the ace of Gaki Tsukai.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think you can tell by looking at this outfit.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll take it.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What about the others?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Just like that?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I think you can tell by looking at this outfit.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Where are you going to defend?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I just wanted to be funny.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where are you going to defend when you are looking at this outfit?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't know where to defend.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's an ugly outfit.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's go.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The game is about to begin.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's get started.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
As expected from producer Gordon.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Gaki Tsukai team vs. the Haruno baseball team has finally begun.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's look forward to what kind of talent will appear.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Number one, second, electric groove, Pierre Taki.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Number two, Nana.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Number one is Pierre Taki.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yamazaki is glaring at him.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Pierre, Pierre, shoot, shoot.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The game is about to begin.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Iyagao is also getting nervous.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The game is about to begin.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He looks at the sign and nods.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He throws a big ball.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is a sudden bing ball.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yamazaki is not sure where to put his hand.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Pierre is also looking at him.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's get closer.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's get closer.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's get closer.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yamazaki is challenging.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He regains his composure.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Number two.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
lado bedQuery.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Stop this.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Stop this.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Stop this.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Stop this.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Pierre.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Stop this.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't be greedy, Pierre.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't shoot me.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You hit me.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You hit me.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He hit you.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stop this.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
っGo home!

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What the hell are you doing?

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What the hell are you doing?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey, Yamazaki

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't get excited

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's have fun

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Finally, the two were separated

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Pierre is the first

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No.2

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
First

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Nakano Hideo

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Familiar with Choro

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No.10

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No.2 is Nakano Hideo

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yamazaki jumps

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Nakano also jumps

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Again

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Stop it

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Stop it

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's play baseball

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's play baseball

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's play baseball

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's play baseball

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's play baseball

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's play baseball

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No.1

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yamazaki jumps

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No.1

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He throws

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The ball hits Nakano

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Nakano goes to Yamazaki

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Stop it

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Stop it

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Stop it

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Both teams are excited

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Both teams are excited

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Both teams are excited

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What the hell are you doing?

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The controller is bad

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you use your strength, you can catch the ball

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's have fun

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's have fun

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Team Sky

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No.1

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.3

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No.3

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The butterfly club

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ryuhei Ueshiba

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ryuhei Ueshiba

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.7

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No.11

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The batter is Ueshiba

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm watching

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In the middle

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can't hit it

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yamazaki's pitching

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yamazaki's pitching

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is a dead ball

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is Ueshiba

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sorry

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sorry

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Stop it

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go home

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Stop it

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Stop it

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yamazaki

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You should apologize

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sorry

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sorry

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You messed up my field

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't get angry

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yamazaki's strike

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yamazaki's strike

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No.4

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Miyaji

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Miyaji

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No.1

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Miyaji

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yamazaki

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What kind of pitching will he show?

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He is in the set position

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He threw the ball

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Where did you throw it?

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Where did you throw it?

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where did you throw it?

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where did you throw it?

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yamazaki

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He threw the ball

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't remember

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yamazaki

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yamazaki

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He threw a bow

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yamazaki

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yamazaki

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When you apologize, this has to be so

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yamazaki

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yamazaki

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You made a mistake

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yamazaki

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yamazaki

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you talking about?

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't care anymore.

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't care anymore.

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a dead ball.

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a dead ball.

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You have to pass it.

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Pierre.

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's a push-off.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a push-off.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's a push-off with four consecutive dead balls.

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The Gerojin team is one point behind.

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Number 5.

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Catcher.

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Kenji Takano, who is familiar with Pizzeria.

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Kenji Takano.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Number 17.

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, the scary batter has come out.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He is the current pro-wrestler, Kenji Takano.

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He is a power hitter with a height of 2m.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Time.

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Time?

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wait a minute.

187
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm...

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What's wrong, Yamazaki?

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He calls everyone to the mound.

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's dangerous.

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's dangerous.

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You said it.

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You said it.

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Is that so?

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's right.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He said it himself.

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's not true.

198
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He said it was funny recently.

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Takano.

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's not funny.

201
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's not funny.

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's not funny.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not funny.

204
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The game resumed.

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What kind of ball will Yamazaki, Kyosha, and Takano hit?

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oops.

207
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a dead ball again.

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm cool.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Really.

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm cool.

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Takano, really.

212
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm cool.

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Takano.

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm cool.

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm cool.

216
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm cool.

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Takano.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm cool.

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Takano.

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm cool beauty.

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Takano.

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm cool.

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Takano.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm cool.

225
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey, he hit it lightly.

226
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He hits it lightly.

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I dont't know what happened.

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, it's fine.

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's fine.

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's OK, it's OK.

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's OK.

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's fine.

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is fine.

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Indeed, Yamazaki.

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's not true!

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's your fault!

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My fault?

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why?

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Who told you to open the door?

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's my fault.

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Then I'll do it.

242
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Stop it!

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yamazaki!

244
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Stop it!

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's run!

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Stop it!

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's run!

248
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Stop it!

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Come on!

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You know...

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know the buzzword, right?

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The buzzword.

254
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's a simple story.

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's just a story about how many times you have to repeat it.

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a complicated story.

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've said it before, but it's painful.

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's painful.

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's painful.

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't think about it at all, do you?

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't think about it at all.

262
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I know.

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't think about it at all.

264
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't think about it at all.

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But I've been saying it for about two months.

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's painful.

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's painful.

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They've made it a buzzword.

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't think about it at all.

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, it's okay.

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know if it will become a buzzword.

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How many years has it been?

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's stupid to think about it.

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I used to say that I haven't heard of it for a long time.

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Come to think of it, I'm the only one who has a buzzword.

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
For example?

278
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
For example, there are a lot of people who haven't noticed it.

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
For example?

280
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well...

281
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, really...

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Say it!

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can't say, for example.

284
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't say, for example.

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're laughing, aren't you?

286
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's not what I'm laughing at right now.

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What are you angry about?

288
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's right.

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The buzzword is...

290
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The real buzzword is...

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Say it!

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's painful.

293
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, it's okay.

294
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's never going to be a buzzword.

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The buzzword that made me popular is...

296
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a buzzword that's too deep to be a buzzword.

297
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
For example, what is it?

298
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Recently, many people say,

299
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You seem to be a little blue today.

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm the one who said that!

301
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Right?

302
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't say that.

304
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I know you're going to ask me why.

305
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If you can't say it, it's okay.

306
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If you dare to say it, let me say it.

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Until I said it, everyone didn't say it was blue.

308
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know about that.

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like it's heavy.

310
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can't say that.

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ah, it's heavy today.

312
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's what I said before I said it.

313
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But it's become so popular that it's not even a buzzword.

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have a lot of buzzwords like this.

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What else is there?

316
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Other than that...

317
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's right.

318
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's tight.

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Everyone didn't say it was tight either.

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

321
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In the past, everyone didn't use the word tight like that.

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Eh?

323
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What is it?

324
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What is it with you guys?

325
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you know what it means when you say, go go?

326
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, no, no, no, no.

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
These guys are no good.

328
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think it's better not to say things like that.

329
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But it's starting to get weird.

330
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I know, I know.

331
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're starting to get weird.

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, it's fine.

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If it's starting to get weird naturally, then in your mind...

334
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I said that.

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, it's fine.

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
With a big heart.

337
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I said it.

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I said it.

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's starting to get weird.

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I said it, so it's not cool.

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It doesn't sound like me at all.

342
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But...

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm imitating you.

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm saying the way you say it.

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm saying the way you say it.

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why are you imitating me and you?

347
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I often see you imitating me.

348
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Who?

349
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Me.

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, no, no.

351
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I've never seen you imitating me.

352
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've seen it.

353
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I've seen it.

354
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Really?

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've never seen it.

356
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I've never seen it.

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Does it look like you?

358
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
People around me...

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They say I look like a rotten talent.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They say I look like a rotten talent.

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They say I look like a rotten talent.

362
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Who is a rotten talent?

363
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know.

364
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean,

365
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm a customer who wants to see it.

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't buy it.

367
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm saying it's a rotten talent.

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm not saying it.

369
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There are people who look like you.

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I look like a person who looks like you.

371
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have a lot of them.

372
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't say that.

373
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, no, no.

374
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I have them.

375
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What?

376
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I said you look like him all the time.

377
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Even when you're wearing clothes.

378
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What kind of face is that?

379
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No, no, sometimes I look like Nobu at the door

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But there's no one who looks like me

381
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There was a time when I was in Downtown Jill

382
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
When you were on the phone?

383
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, yes, yes, I was tricked by someone who looked like me

384
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We're really similar, we're in the same car

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The way we stand is exactly the same

386
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I definitely thought it was you

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I want to see that

388
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It was you, wasn't it?

389
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to tell you now

390
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm going to tell you now

391
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That woman was totally into you

392
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
She was totally into you

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
She was into me

394
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

395
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's enough

396
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm going to tell you now

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You know, you know

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
First of all, I don't know what kind of image you have of women

399
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But I've never been able to trick a woman

400
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's amazing

401
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's amazing

402
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's like a gold-plated front door

403
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you remember it clearly?

404
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But I was in Osaka

405
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was wearing the same clothes as you

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I told her to show me this

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
She tried it on

408
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's different

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You look exactly like me

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can tell by the way you talk

411
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know because I'm an amateur

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But I know

413
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why do you know?

414
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why do you know?

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Even if you look exactly like me

416
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can tell that it's not you

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Of course

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But

419
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I can tell by the position of your mole

420
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can tell just by looking at you

421
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I've never seen you up close

422
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So I don't know

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's not true

424
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There are people who saw you on TV for the first time

425
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's completely different from watching it on TV

426
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's completely different

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I can tell why you're popular on TV

428
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because I saw you in person

429
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What do you want to say?

430
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're talking nonsense

431
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
My legs are longer than they were on TV

432
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's not long

433
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's normal

434
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's talk about that again

435
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's here again

436
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not long

437
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're really

438
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I told you not to believe everything you see

439
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's not what I saw

440
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I saw it with my own eyes

441
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I saw it with my own eyes

442
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I saw it with my own eyes

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What?

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I saw it with my own eyes

445
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I saw it with my own eyes

446
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's long, isn't it?

447
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What?

448
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's long?

449
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
My legs

450
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You said it's not long

451
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's nothing here

452
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It says to go deeper

453
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There's no place to go deeper

454
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No, no

455
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not like that

456
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's deeper

457
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's here

458
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's deeper

459
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What is it?

460
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a roll

461
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was looking for that

462
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's written on it?

463
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And then

464
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What?

465
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How long are you going to do this?

466
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's not over yet

467
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't help it

468
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
When I'm working

469
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Are you going to cut it?

470
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Of course

471
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If you cut it, you can use it

472
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What do you mean?

473
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you want to do it to someone?

474
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Do you want to do it to someone?

475
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
To a bald person

476
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Who do you want to do it to?

477
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I said to a bald person

478
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Give me the writing

479
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The other day I was doing the internet

480
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I got a secret information from a medical person

481
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Matsumoto-san, every month

482
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Why are you doing a blood test to the limit of your body?

483
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Have you ever done a blood test?

484
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I've done it before

485
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can't do something like that for someone

486
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why?

487
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's a lie

488
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's true

489
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

490
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Why?

491
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
How many times have you done it?

492
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've done it almost every day

493
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Are you stupid?

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You've done it twice to the same person

495
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You've done it so many times

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There's no way

497
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There's no way

498
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why?

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Why do you do it to the limit of your body every month?

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Do you know the limit of a human's mouth?

501
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't know

502
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How many cc did you take?

503
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't remember

505
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was trying to cover it with mine

506
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's not like that

507
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Usually you take 200 cc

508
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Is that so?

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Right?

510
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
200

511
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Really?

512
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think you took 200 too

513
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

514
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You said 400

515
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A little

516
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
A little bit

517
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What do you mean by a little bit?

518
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
A little bit

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
A tough person

520
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A tough person?

521
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I was amazing

522
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A normal person took 400?

523
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes

524
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I also took a hectare

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Because the people who are a tough person

526
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
call it a hectare

527
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Because it has a name

528
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's called a hectare in the north again

529
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a stupid name

530
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's called a hectare

531
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This is stupid

532
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
A hectare?

533
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So tell me why you're doing it

534
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Do you want Yakult?

535
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'll give you a quarter

536
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't be so stingy

537
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll give you a quarter

538
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't go that far

539
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't think that it's the same as the Yakult you gave to your partner

540
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and the Yakult you gave to a stingy person

541
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The weight is different between the money you worked hard for and the money you got

542
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm going to tell you about that

543
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry

544
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Tell me about the weight

545
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Tell me about the weight

546
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Tell me about the weight

547
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm embarrassed

548
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Tell me about the weight

549
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Tell me about the weight

550
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The weight

551
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What?

552
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Mr. Matsumoto is famous for being fast

553
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Please show us your skills

554
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Have you ever done a fast shot?

555
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I haven't done a fast shot

556
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I've done a shotgun

557
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Why?

558
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because you're from Tokyo?

559
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
A shotgun?

560
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What are you going to do when you go to practice?

561
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a foreign country

562
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you sure it's a foreign country?

563
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Please

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
A fast shot?

565
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I haven't done a fast shot

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Try it

567
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Isn't it easy?

568
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm going to do it

569
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's really slow

570
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why?

571
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's really slow

572
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's wrong with it?

573
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What's wrong with it?

574
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I made a mistake from the place I went on my school trip

575
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's impossible

576
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I see

577
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I made a mistake when I went to Kutami-gaura

578
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You too

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You too

580
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You too

581
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's too slow

582
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Too slow

583
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I went to the second floor

584
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What's slow?

585
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The posture is wrong

586
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's like this

587
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If it's a shotgun, say it's a shotgun

588
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What's wrong with it?

589
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's strange

590
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Normally it's like this

591
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No, it's like this

592
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I feel bad

593
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You feel bad

594
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You look like you're going to throw up

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I feel bad

596
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Please do it

597
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Are you sure?

598
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you know what a fast shot is?

599
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
A fast shot

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It means to shoot fast

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
A fast shot

602
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I know

603
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You can't even lift this hand

604
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't say it

605
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You can't do a fast shot

606
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I can't say it

607
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You can't even lift this hand

608
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey, hey, hey

609
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's do it

610
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's do a fast shot

611
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Please do it

612
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's do it

613
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hey

614
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What is it?

615
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What is it?

616
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What is it?

617
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Put it in front of you

618
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Why are you doing that?

619
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There's no point in shooting this

620
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It means to shoot fast

621
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There's usually people on the other side

622
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I don't know about that

623
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
If you shoot fast, you win

624
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You can shoot as fast as you want

625
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's dangerous if you shoot here

626
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why is it dangerous?

627
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't know if you'll hit your foot

628
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's a bit dangerous

629
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I just did that

630
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:13,000
