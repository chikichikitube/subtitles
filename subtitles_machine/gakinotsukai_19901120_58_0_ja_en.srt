1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chiki Chiki Golf Battle! The punishment game is you!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What are you looking at?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What are you looking at?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Can you show me your face in front of the camera?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't know!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I was told that I can't take off my jacket.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I can't take it off.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Why are you still like this?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It doesn't matter if I'm wearing a jacket.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But it's hard to move.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It doesn't matter at all.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't care about my shoes.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't care about anything.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Even your shoes?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes!

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't care about my shoes.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't care about my shoes.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You don't care about your teeth?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, yes, yes.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I see.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's do it.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What is this?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is Shomei's army.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I know that!

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know that!

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What?

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can you borrow this?

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is the meaning of this?

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do you know what kind of plus side it has?

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you wear this, you won't be able to go to the gym.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wow!

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Either way, you can't do it.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why?

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you really left-handed?

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, I am.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do you shoot with your left hand?

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, I shoot with my right hand.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then, which way do you shoot with your glove?

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I shoot with my right hand.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Either way, you can't do it.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I will shoot first.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It is difficult to hit the pole like this.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This club is big.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey!

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Like this.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like this.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It is good, isn't it?

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How do you hold it?

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey!

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It is important.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is good.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey!

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You are holding it.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey!

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It is empty.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look at the ball.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It is good to hit it like this, isn't it?

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It depends on how you feel.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It is good to hit it like this, isn't it?

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The ball is here.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It is good to hit it like this, isn't it?

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It depends on how you feel.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It depends on how you feel.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It depends on how you feel.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are not good at acting.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I am bad at acting.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It depends on how you feel.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey!

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't go home.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It is good.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It is good to hit it like this, isn't it?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It depends on how you feel.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I see.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I see.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It depends on how you feel.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I see.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey!

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It depends on how you feel.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It depends on how you feel.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I see.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It depends on how you feel.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You are thinking about it.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It is good.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is hard.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think so.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It is good.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It is good.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It depends on how you feel.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I see.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The teacher is coming today.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Nice to meet you.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Excuse me, please teach the teacher what he just did.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You are used to it, aren't you?

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can do it if I get used to it.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Look.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Put your hand on the ball.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I will do it.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I got it.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I got it.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I got it.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't think about it.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hello.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hello.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hello.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you not interested in the game?

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What?

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What?

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Look!

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It is not working.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I know.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are not interested in Islands.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No, I am not.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you not?

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Look at me!

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Look sideways!

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is this?

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're so cool!

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What?

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why aren't you wearing your pants properly?

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What?

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Your pants

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're not an old man, you can hear me, right?

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, it's fine

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm getting angry

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Today, we have to think about the punishment game

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We haven't decided yet if we're going to play golf

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We're going to play golf

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Golf, right?

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You were pretty good at golf

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It was my first time, but I'm pretty good

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, you're not

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, no, but I'm really...

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There's no sports that I can't do

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've mastered everything

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
With this slender body?

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's right

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This quickness

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
First, when I was swimming

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This was amazing

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought it was bad

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wait a minute

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You thought it was bad when you were swimming?

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What was that like?

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was getting better and better

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do you mean?

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What do you mean you were getting better and better?

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It was really fast

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The speed was fast

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Fast?

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If I kept swimming like this

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I felt like I was going to get splashed with water

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I thought this was bad

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you get splashed with water, you can go to the movies

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But as a comedian, I'd feel bad

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I can still go to the movies

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you get splashed with water

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But when I do this

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If I get splashed with water

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No one would say I'm cute

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No one would say I'm cute

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Since you've mastered a lot

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You should be able to play golf

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
For now

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll practice a bit more

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's think about the punishment

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's stop being scared

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What do you want to do?

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If there's nothing scary

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What?

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If there's nothing scary

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's do something embarrassing

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I've done something embarrassing

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll sell my female hormones

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And make breasts

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Even if you sell your female hormones

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Your breasts won't come out

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They'll come out

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They won't

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They will

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's silicone

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then I'll put in silicone

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What are you?

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're doing something embarrassing

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're competing

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're losing

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're next to your father

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're cutting with a knife

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're putting silicone inside

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're putting silicone inside

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What's so embarrassing about that?

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's do it, it's fun

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's fine

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're talking like this

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're talking like this

206
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you do it like this

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's fine

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's fun

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're stupid

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Put it on your nose

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you doing with your nose?

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I won't put silicone inside my nose

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You won't

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What will you do if you put silicone inside your nose?

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Even if you don't understand

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you put it in here

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It won't come out

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's plastic

219
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's like a French nose

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You can't do that

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You lost a punishment game

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You put silicone inside your nose

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're laughing

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When you stop laughing, it's over

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have to talk normally after that

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In your heart

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's fine

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's over

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't do that

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you go to a place like that

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You'll be surrounded by a wire

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And you'll be riding a bike

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's possible

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What about that?

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's possible?

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's possible

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right?

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look, everyone is saying it

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do it

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who are you saying it to?

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Are you saying it to this person?

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wait a minute

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why am I the one saying it?

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hama-chan won't lose

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hama-chan won't lose?

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's fine

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's fine

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's like a gacha pin

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't say things like that

250
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You have to bring all your family

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's fine

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's fine

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's fine

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you lose, will you bring your mother, father, and brother?

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll bring all of them

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Bring all four of them and do a family skit

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll bring all of them and do a family skit

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll bring all of them

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You guys

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You'll die of starvation

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The day you see your family

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's fine if it's you

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You have four family members

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I have five

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's not about the number of people

266
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you lose, instead of doing a family skit

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Do a Go-Ranger

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
With your face painted

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I only have four people

270
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's fine

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm here with you, so do a Go-Ranger

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
For now, take the lead

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go-Ranger

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is delicious

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's a story

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
In Hikoku

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The dog fight in Tosa

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have to break it

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, well, well

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The old men are fighting

281
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It won't end with a well

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, well, well

283
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't they do that in Japan?

284
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The dog fight

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That one

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This one, right?

287
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes, yes, yes

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's good

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That one, right?

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's go to Spain on this show

291
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Spain

292
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We went to Okinawa

293
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's go to Spain next

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's right

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you can do it, that's good

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's increase the number of pro-wrestlers

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What are you doing?

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What are you doing?

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Say it

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Family?

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do a family skit

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You said it

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You said it

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
My dad is weird

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't catch a running mouse

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Give me your letter

307
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
For the time being

308
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't introduce me

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
How long have you been talking?

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What time is it?

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's already 7.40

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
7.40?

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hello

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hello

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She's coming

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's go

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's give the letter to the person we want to introduce

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's introduce

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's start with the general

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What do you like? Spaghetti?

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And downtown

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Thank you

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Please leave it here

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Let's introduce the letter

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's introduce the letter

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
First, this person

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
From Ibaraki

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yuko Naito, 17 years old

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Kama-chan used to live in a car

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is this true?

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If it's true, please tell us more about your life

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn't live in a car

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You used to drive a Mk2

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you didn't go home

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you didn't go home at all

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You were always in the car

340
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I didn't go home

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I just packed my luggage

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was asked if I lived in a car

343
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was amazing

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The luggage

345
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Autumn, winter, summer, spring

346
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
All of them

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What's with the Masatoshi collection?

348
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's not true

349
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's because there were a lot of clothes

350
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't put summer, spring, autumn, winter

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was surprised

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's true

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It was packed

354
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes

355
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everyone was looking for you

356
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They were looking for Golgo 13

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Right?

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's what it is

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Please read it

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My pen name is Nagano Ken

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I hate Mach-chan

362
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There are a lot of people like that

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
My friend Yuuki is a big fan of Masatoshi

364
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He always says he likes Ike-ike

365
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So he became Ike-ike

366
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He shaved his hair

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He bought a bodycon suit

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He started to wear flashy makeup

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yuuki said he couldn't change it

370
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now he's completely Ike-ike

371
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He used to be a quiet and cute kid

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Give me back my old Yuuki!

373
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He's watching Gakitsukai

374
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Please say something to Yuuki

375
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Go back to normal

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He only listens to what you say

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He doesn't listen to me

378
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I value Yuuki

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Now Yuuki is Ike-ike

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He doesn't have many friends

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There's no one who says I'm a good kid

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Please, Mach-chan

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Go back to your old Yuuki

384
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There's no need to go back

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I want everyone in the world to be like that

386
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So

387
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If he becomes Ike-ike

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And asks you what you think

389
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's okay

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't know if I can meet him

391
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I feel sorry for him

392
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's true

393
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But even today's guests

394
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're all wearing too much

395
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They're hiding their skin too much

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's the fashion of this time

397
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This season

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This isn't okay

399
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
More, more

400
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Show more

401
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's cold outside

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's not okay

403
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's better to dress like a primitive person

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Where in the world do you think you're going?

405
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
A woman wearing pants is the worst

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's all skirts

407
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Skirts that you can see

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's good

409
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Right?

410
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Everyone, don't think too much

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Even if you dig out your own blood

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't think much

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't lie

414
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't lie

415
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll try to dig out my own blood

416
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You'll do it?

417
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't care

418
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't think it's bad

419
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Really?

420
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You can let me out

421
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Freely?

422
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can let me out freely

423
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't think I'm a weirdo

424
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't feel anything

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Everyone, more

426
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What do you feel?

427
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What?

428
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What do you feel?

429
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You don't feel anything even if you dig out your own blood

430
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What do you feel?

431
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
In the situation where I dug out my own blood

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You don't have to dig out your own blood

433
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You don't have to dig out your own blood

434
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, in that case

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You don't feel anything even if you dig out your own blood

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What do you feel other than your own blood?

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If you dig out your own blood and put something in it

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you surprised at?

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, no

440
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're hiding too much

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hiding too much is normal

442
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're hiding like a real person

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's not good

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Go to another country

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
There are countries where they don't hide their breasts

446
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They only hide their bottom

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If they hide their bottom, I think it's fine

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes, yes

449
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You're lying

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's right

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Men only do this with bamboo

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Bamboo?

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm doing bamboo, but you're sticking out your balls

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What?

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Do you know what clothes were originally for?

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
To prevent bacteria from entering

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm not ashamed of being able to see bamboo

458
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm just doing it so I don't get hurt

459
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm going into the forest

460
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So I don't get hurt

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So why are you sticking out your balls?

462
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm not hurt

463
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's not good

464
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What's not good?

465
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If you get hit, it hurts

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What do you do if you get cut?

467
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a stone in the river

468
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't know why it's round

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's round because it's flowing

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's round because you're sticking out your balls

471
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not round because everyone's sticking out their balls

472
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's round because of the wind

473
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's round because you're sticking out your balls

474
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're making fun of me

475
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's true

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You don't know anything

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You don't know anything

478
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even your nose is round

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's round because it's sticking out

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What?

481
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What did you say?

482
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's round because my nose is sticking out

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
My ears are sticking out though

484
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What?

485
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ears

486
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're sticking out your ears

487
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, we are just sticking out our ears

488
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We're sticking out our noses

489
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But our ears are still sticking out

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We're sticking out our ears

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Your ears are sticking out and your nose is sticking out too!

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm digging out your chin!

493
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Your chin is round!

494
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But the part you're digging out...

495
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Isn't it round?

496
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's long!

497
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If this was round...

498
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I would think so too...

499
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But it's really long!

500
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's going to be round from now on!

501
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Your fingers are going to be round!

502
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The Doraemon is going to be round!

503
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's a cat from the future!

504
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's going to be round!

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's how it's going to be from now on!

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's going to be round!

507
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't accept this...

508
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't accept this ear!

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not round!

510
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Your ears aren't sticking out!

511
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's sticking out!

512
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This is the ear!

513
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm digging out your chin!

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not round!

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's going to be round!

516
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's going to be round!

517
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is the ear!

518
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's not sticking out!

519
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're persistent!

520
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's enough!

521
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So...

522
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We're done for today!

523
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's all for today!

524
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Next week...

525
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's think about it!

526
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's all for today!

527
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
See you next week!

528
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Bye!

529
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Next week...

530
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
How are you going to buy it?

531
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So...

532
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So...

533
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So...

534
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So...

535
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So...

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So...

537
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So...

538
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So...

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So...

540
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So...

541
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So...

542
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So...

543
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So...

544
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So...

545
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So...

546
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So...

547
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So...

548
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So...

549
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So...

550
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So...

551
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So...

552
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So...

553
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So...

554
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This is the final decision.

555
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's do that.

556
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Until now, Yuta has lined up all of them.

557
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
My father too?

558
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Your father too?

559
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Your father and the one with the long nose.

560
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He lined up all of them.

561
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He chose them all.

562
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He did this and that.

563
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The one with the long nose is impossible.

564
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Anyway, all of them.

565
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The assistants too.

566
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They are still recruiting.

567
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Please look forward to it.

568
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's all for now.

569
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not going to be a kid anymore.

570
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
See you next week.

571
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Please look forward to it.

572
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
