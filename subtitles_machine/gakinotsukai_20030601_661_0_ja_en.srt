1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm in trouble.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What is it?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
when I'll be able to take a break.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're not cold?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're not cold?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Excuse me.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Good morning.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Excuse me.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can I talk to you?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why?

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is it?

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What's wrong?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I got some information yesterday.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Aki-chi is in love with a great Shina.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What?

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Aki-chi is in love with a great Shina.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You should have told me.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I was wondering if you could tell me today.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's wrong?

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
A great Shina is in love with a great Shina.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What's great about a great Shina?

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A great Shina is in love with a great Shina.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A great Shina is in love with a great Shina.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Anyway, everyone...

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, that's what Tajima says.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why?

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're a great trustee.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go see.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How many times have you been fooled?

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, please.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're a great trustee.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's go.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're a great trustee.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're a great trustee.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's go.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Excuse me, this is the place.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Really?

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't trust you.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We'll be out soon.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really?

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tajima is right.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's going on?

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's going on?

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's going on between you two?

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't get it.

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is the place?

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the place.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are we the only ones here?

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Really?

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are we the only ones here?

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's dig.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's dig.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've never done this before.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's true.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's an excavation.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I wonder if something historical will come out.

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nothing's coming out.

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What is this?

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is this?

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If this doesn't come out, it's the worst.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's the worst.

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You have to dig that much.

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You have to dig that much.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll dig around here.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh!

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you find something?

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I found something.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is it?

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is this?

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's in a shallow place.

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is that?

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh!

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh!

79
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is it?

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh!

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And this.

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is here.

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a takuto.

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And it's a sashimi.

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's nostalgic.

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's nostalgic.

87
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What generation is takuto?

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Takuto?

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, I rode it.

90
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Really?

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You rode it?

92
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yamazaki and I didn't ride it at all.

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ran was promoting this.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right.

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ito Ran?

96
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ran's something.

98
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Something will come out.

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Something may come out.

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's nostalgic.

101
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's dig hard.

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Isn't there anything here?

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Something got caught again.

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's go there.

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What is it?

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is this?

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What is this?

108
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What is this?

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is this?

110
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is this?

111
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What is this?

112
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's different from the plan.

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is this?

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a Troy curtain.

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's nostalgic.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's nostalgic.

117
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why is it in a box?

118
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is nostalgic.

119
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's nostalgic.

120
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's nostalgic.

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But Yankee was here.

122
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's Yankee.

124
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a white high-neck.

125
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is delicious.

126
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

127
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's wrong?

128
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There is something.

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Something is coming out.

130
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is it?

131
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a Tominaga Ichiro.

132
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's nostalgic.

133
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a Tominaga Ichiro.

134
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a Tominaga Ichiro.

135
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is amazing.

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a Tennis Tournament Pro.

137
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's nostalgic.

138
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's amazing.

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's nostalgic.

140
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't you know the Tennis Tournament Pro?

141
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Really?

142
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know.

143
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is nostalgic.

144
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He is the first famous tennis player in Japan.

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's the famous Tennis Tournament Pro.

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I know.

147
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's a video.

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a video tape.

149
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What is this?

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There is nothing in it.

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's take a look.

152
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There is a TV.

153
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There is a TV.

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There is a TV.

155
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a TV.

156
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What is this?

157
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a playback.

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's okay.

159
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a playback.

160
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a playback.

161
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's finished.

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a Lamborghini.

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a Lamborghini.

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's nostalgic.

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's nostalgic.

166
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a Lamborghini.

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's for editing.

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's popular.

169
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's popular.

170
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What is this project?

171
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What is this?

172
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's amazing.

173
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's nostalgic.

174
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How many years ago was this?

175
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was 15 years ago.

176
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It was in the 80s.

177
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It was in the 80s.

178
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It was in Osaka.

179
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It was 10 years ago.

180
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's nostalgic.

181
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm looking forward to it.

182
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What is this?

183
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was prepared.

184
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What is this?

185
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's full.

186
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's not full.

187
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What is this?

188
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not full.

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's a flower box.

190
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is this a flower box?

191
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a flower box.

192
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a flower box.

193
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If it was a flower box, I would have worked part-time here.

194
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Really?

195
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

196
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What time is it?

197
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's 3 minutes and 8 minutes.

198
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a flower box.

199
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's nostalgic.

200
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's nostalgic.

201
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I worked part-time here.

202
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Really?

203
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

204
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I organized traffic.

205
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's nostalgic.

206
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's nostalgic.

207
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I've never been there.

208
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's very nostalgic.

209
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's very nostalgic.

210
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's amazing.

211
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I want to take this home.

212
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What kind of scene is this?

213
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's nostalgic.

214
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I told you it's nostalgic.

215
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's hot.

216
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I told you it's 100 yen at a 100 yen shop.

217
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is this?

218
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm a gorilla.

219
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's nostalgic.

220
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I had this doll.

221
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What is this?

222
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm a gorilla.

223
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a good one.

224
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a good one.

225
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a good one.

226
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a good one.

227
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a gorilla.

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's small.

229
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I didn't know that.

230
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was so close.

231
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was close.

232
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was so close.

233
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll give you this.

234
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know at all.

235
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The next day

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's here again.

237
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know at all.

238
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Good luck, Matsumoto.

239
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's here again.

240
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What is it?

241
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a Romeshi.

242
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's nostalgic.

243
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I know it.

244
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a Romeshi.

245
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's a Romeshi.

246
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know.

247
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's nostalgic.

248
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What is this?

249
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What is this?

250
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a change.

251
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ponce.

252
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's nostalgic.

253
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Ponce.

254
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I know that.

255
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's very famous.

256
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's very famous.

257
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The next day

258
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's here again.

259
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Something came out.

260
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is that?

261
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a game software.

262
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a Famicom.

263
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What is that?

264
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Star Soldier.

265
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't know.

266
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know.

267
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I play games, but...

268
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know.

269
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have more.

270
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The next day

271
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's here.

272
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's here.

273
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Matsumoto.

274
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There's something big.

275
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I know this.

276
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Madame Yann

277
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Madame Yann is my ramen

278
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I know Madame Yann

279
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I know

280
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a high-class name

281
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's our time

282
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We were making a joke

283
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Madame Yann

284
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can't make a joke out of a person's stuff

285
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Madame Yann is my ramen

286
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hey

287
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Tanaka, something's coming out

288
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have something

289
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Here it comes

290
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hey

291
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's big

292
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What is it?

293
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not big

294
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not big at all

295
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Tanaka

296
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a morer

297
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a morer

298
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's a morer

299
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I knew it

300
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I knew it

301
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There was a morer

302
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
As if it were alive

303
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
As if it were alive

304
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I was like this

305
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But I can't do it at all

306
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tajima, this place is amazing

307
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey

308
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes

309
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Look at this

310
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh

311
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Wow

312
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a morer

313
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is it?

314
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a morer

315
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's a morer

316
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I've never seen it

317
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a morer

318
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a morer

319
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I've never seen it

320
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a morer

321
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You'll know when you see it

322
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait, the video

323
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's still coming out

324
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's still coming out

325
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's take a look

326
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is this?

327
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Look at your shadow

328
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is it?

329
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Chocobay

330
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Look at the sky

331
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know

332
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Is it Chocobay?

333
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's amazing

334
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know

335
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's Chocobay

336
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's Chocobay

337
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want to drink it

338
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I want to drink it

339
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Chocobay

340
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Chocobay

341
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Chocobay

342
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is this?

343
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know

344
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Morinaga Chocobay

345
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's Chocobay

346
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's cheap

347
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why don't you know Chocobay?

348
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What is Chocobay?

349
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was a huge boom

350
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There was a bay seal

351
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't collect it

352
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I took a picture of the name

353
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hitobay

354
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I was looking for my name

355
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I wanted Yamabay

356
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000

357
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000

What is it?

359
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did you get it?

360
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Did you get it?

361
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is amazing

362
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What is it?

363
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is amazing

364
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mataro

365
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I know this

366
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know this

367
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I know this

368
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is amazing

369
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a dummy Oscar

370
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't know

371
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know

372
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know

373
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know

374
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know

375
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you stupid?

376
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You are a serial killer

377
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't you have anything?

378
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't you have anything?

379
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Something came out

380
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Something came out?

381
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Something came out

382
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is

383
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
How about this?

384
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Eat

385
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I love this

386
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There was ice cream

387
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It was like a sports bag

388
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It was delicious

389
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It was delicious

390
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It was delicious

391
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is so nostalgic

392
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Matsumoto is coming

393
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Really?

394
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is it?

395
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is good

396
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is so nostalgic

397
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There was a container like this

398
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Tower

399
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is Eroica

400
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There was Eroica

401
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There was Eroica Old Toilet

402
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There was Eroica Old Toilet

403
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is so nostalgic

404
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The smell

405
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The smell

406
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Eroica

407
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Eroica

408
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is so nostalgic

409
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There is nothing

410
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It came out

411
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It came out

412
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It came out again

413
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Matsumoto will be happy

414
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Robotacchi

415
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is so nostalgic

416
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If you are a human

417
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Be a friend

418
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If you are a robot, be a robotacchi

419
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Time goes by

420
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Even if the times change

421
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In the corner of their memories

422
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Nostalgic things that have continued to remain

423
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When I was a child

424
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That toy that everyone collected

425
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Youth

426
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That cartoon that I enjoyed with my friends

427
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The good old days of Showa

428
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The number of such memories

429
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It is a proof that they have lived

430
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know if I can be buried

431
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sorry

432
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm angry

433
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I am a child

434
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Gaki Gaki-kun

435
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Gaki Gaki-kun

436
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Gaki Gaki-kun

437
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Gaki Gaki-kun

438
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Gari Gari-kun

439
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I understand

440
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I understand

441
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I understand

442
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I understand

443
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What did you understand?

444
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It was a little weak

445
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was about 48 points

446
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What are you talking about?

447
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
48 points

448
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry

449
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
32 points of talent

450
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's below this

451
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But I wasn't afraid

452
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What do you mean?

453
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Among the regular users

454
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I am the only one

455
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The only one

456
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's right

457
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Tanaka is married

458
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was surprised

459
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I was surprised

460
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Seriously

461
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That kid

462
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That thin beard

463
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That thin beard

464
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was surprised

465
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Overall

466
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you think about it

467
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You and Imada

468
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Me and Imada

469
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And

470
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How far can you go?

471
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okama no Fuji

472
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's Okama

473
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know

474
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It can't be helped

475
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How far can you go?

476
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know how to use Gaki

477
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Everyone has Gaki

478
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right

479
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What do you think?

480
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's like this

481
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can't draw

482
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You can't draw

483
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No

484
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No one will introduce me

485
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Right?

486
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why?

487
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Can you introduce Kozuki Maya?

488
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What?

489
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What?

490
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Can you introduce someone like Kozuki Maya?

491
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who is Kozuki Maya?

492
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know

493
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know

494
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know either

495
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There's no one like Kozuki Maya

496
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Who is Kozuki Maya?

497
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know

498
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't know

499
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't know

500
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The atmosphere looks good

501
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It looks like it's tight

502
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is there someone like Takarazuka?

503
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There's no one like that

504
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't you know?

505
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Kozuki Maya

506
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know

507
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What is that?

508
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's like Misaki Kyouka

509
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There's no one like that

510
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Someone who says I know

511
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Someone told me

512
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What kind of image is that?

513
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What kind of image is Misaki Kyouka?

514
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know

515
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know either

516
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think it would be nice if there was someone like that

517
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a difficult story

518
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If that happens, when you and Imada get married

519
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What kind of woman will you be?

520
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's right

521
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll tell you this

522
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Imada wants to get married

523
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
She doesn't have a girlfriend

524
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Even now, she's asking if there's someone like that

525
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you ask her, she'll do it right away

526
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Really?

527
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a little different from me

528
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's another one

529
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yamamoto from Gokuraku is also single

530
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But I don't want him to be in the same group

531
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's different

532
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The way he thinks is different

533
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The way he walks is different

534
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Everyone has their own circumstances

535
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What kind of circumstances do you have?

536
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is Kiza's story

537
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I want to take everyone to Paris for a moment

538
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry

539
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
A trip to Paris for a moment

540
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's fine

541
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
A trip to Petit Paris

542
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's fine

543
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What?

544
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What do you call it?

545
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Marriage is...

546
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Fun?

547
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No

548
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's no

549
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Marriage is...

550
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A trip to Petit Paris

551
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What?

552
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That was a trip to Petit Paris?

553
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Please come back

554
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Did you take a picture?

555
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That was too fast

556
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't notice

557
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've never been to Paris

558
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Maybe I'm thinking more lightly

559
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
On the contrary

560
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can do it anytime

561
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When I finished drawing

562
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
When I got married

563
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I went to Paris

564
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Today

565
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We were on the bus

566
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We were on the bus

567
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There was a moment

568
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yamazaki and Endo were at Hamada

569
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The three of them were talking about kindergarten

570
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I thought it was scary

571
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I was here

572
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Tanaka was here

573
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Tanaka too

574
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is bad

575
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Miyasako too

576
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They were talking about school

577
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They were talking about school

578
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's scary

579
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They moved

580
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
To the area where the children went to school

581
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Even now, Miyasako is looking for Fudo

582
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
For the children

583
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The entertainers have changed too

584
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But

585
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
My wife

586
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Who is your wife?

587
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm trying to live in a good family

588
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not a good family

589
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What is it?

590
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't know if it will happen

591
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It will never happen

592
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You're just saying it now

593
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Logan

594
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's close

595
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You're just saying it now

596
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It will happen

597
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I won't let you go to school

598
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's not it

599
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I won't let you go to school

600
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I won't let you go to school

601
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I won't let you go to school

602
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I won't let you go to school

603
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I understand

604
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What will you do if you don't let me go to school?

605
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll stay at home

606
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's strange

607
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't make friends

608
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What is a friend?

609
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Think about it

610
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
How many people cry when they die?

611
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I see

612
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Have you seen it?

613
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No

614
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
At the very least, your family will cry

615
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh my

616
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Hama-chan

617
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Your family won't cry

618
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
For a moment

619
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I thought I was going to die

620
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But when I said I was going to die

621
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll go to the sky

622
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll lose to curry

623
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If you don't have an ant, you're an ant Matsumoto-san

624
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Is that okay?

625
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's right

626
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
In this world, what do you think is an ant?

627
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Please tell me everything

628
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Where should I start?

629
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It doesn't matter if it's an object

630
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's see

631
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
A little drool

632
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
No

633
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know what you mean

634
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't know which is a little drool

635
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
On the contrary, there is a little drool

636
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Of course there is

637
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't ask me in such an embarrassing way

638
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's your point of view

639
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Because you

640
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why are you laughing?

641
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why are you laughing?

642
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Be honest

643
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Like this

644
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're an idiot

645
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
On the contrary

646
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Sorry, I'll go back to the story

647
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Do you know what's here?

648
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you know this is drooling?

649
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That's not it

650
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
For example, there is a guy with a face like HG

651
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I know

652
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's drooling

653
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
When I looked at it, it was a little drool

654
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This guy

655
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I know this guy

656
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I know this guy

657
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What is it?

658
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There is such a thing

659
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I know you don't say

660
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
On the contrary, there is a little drool

661
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I know

662
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't you know?

663
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I know

664
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I know

665
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I know that

666
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I know

667
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I didn't say

668
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's right

669
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I know

670
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I know

671
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
An old lady in her 50s

672
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Why is that?

673
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's an old lady in her 50s

674
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's funny to say that

675
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Is it a real problem?

676
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
An old lady in her 50s

677
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's an old lady in her 50s

678
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
20s woman

679
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
30s woman

680
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
40s woman

681
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
50s old lady

682
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,800
That's why I'm just saying that it's different.

683
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
You're a 60's old lady.

684
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
That's completely different.

685
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,200
No, it's not.

686
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,700
You're a 50's old lady.

687
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,800
That's why I'm just saying that it's different.

688
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,000
You're a 50's old lady.

689
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,600
What are you doing?

690
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Don't you get surprised?

691
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
Don't you think, whoa?

692
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,600
I do.

693
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't like that.

694
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,600
A 50's old lady won't come to my house today.

695
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,100
Who?

696
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
There's a lady with relatives.

697
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
What would you do if I told you?

698
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,000
Hamada, Hamada, Hamada, wait a minute.

699
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,700
On purpose?

700
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,000
With the stage's sleeves.

701
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Right?

702
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Today...

703
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,600
A 50's old lady won't come to my house.

704
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,400
What would you do if I told you?

705
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,700
I see, I see.

706
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,400
I don't care if it's underwear or anything.

707
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,300
Hamada, Hamada, wait a minute.

708
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:10,800
You're a 50's old lady's forgotten item.
