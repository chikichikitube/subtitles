1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Gaki no Tsukai Daishinrenkai has arrived!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
This is the 13th Gaki no Tsukai event!

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Let's go and celebrate the year 2002!

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Daishinrenkai!

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
This year, I, Jr., will also be born.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Happy, Lucky, Ash, and Rush!

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Captain! I'm counting on you!

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Why are you counting on us?

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
We've been laughing at each other for a while now.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Captain!

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
We have a special guest this time.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:01:01,500
First, we have Yoshimoto Kitte's dekoboko duo, Ameagari Kesshita!

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Next, we have Yamashita-san, who will be chosen for the Hanayakusen this year!

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Thank you!

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Yamashita-kun!

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Thank you!

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Next, we have a mascot girl from Gaki no Tsukai Arahen this year!

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Thank you!

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Yoshimoto's back-up boss, Yamada-san!

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Is it Yoshimoto?

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
It's Yoshimoto, right?

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
No, it's not.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
It's Yamada tonight!

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Don't make me say anything other than it's Yamada tonight!

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I thought you'd definitely say it's Yamada tonight!

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
You have to say it right now!

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Next, we have the mascot boy of this show, Downtown!

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Please come forward, mascot boy.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Don't tell me the mascot boy isn't Shinji?

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Now, we have the evil Kizuchi.

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I don't understand what you're saying.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Now, let's be quiet.

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Let's be quiet, you two.

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Don't make a mess.

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Let's be quiet in front of the mirror.

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Now, please give us the award.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Ready, set, go!

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Thank you!

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,500
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Gaki no Tsukai's New Year's Eve party!

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Luxurious food and delicious alcohol.

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Everyone is celebrating the New Year's Eve party and having a good time.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Everyone, look at this.

44
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
He's drinking our Chawanmushi.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Excuse me, can I have some Chawanmushi, please?

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Can I have some of yours, too?

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I like sake.

48
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Can I have some Chawanmushi, please?

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
And some sake, too?

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
And some wine, too.

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Wine?

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Wine.

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
This is Chawanmushi, isn't it?

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Is there such a thing as wine?

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
It's an English word.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
An English word?

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
You know what I mean, right?

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I've never heard of it.

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Why don't you use it, Yamashita?

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Chawanmushi is wine.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Wine.

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm turning it around.

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
No, it's really wine now.

65
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
No, it's not.

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

67
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
You're sweating so much.

68
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
You're trying to look good.

69
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm not sweating like I sweat in sports.

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm sweating so much.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
That's why I said that.

72
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
It's like Choshu.

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
It's sweating like Choshu.

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,500
It's like we're on American TV.

75
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
It's coming.

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm going to turn it around right away.

77
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I can't hear you.

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I can't hear you.

79
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I can't hear you.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Stop laughing.

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Stop laughing.

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I've been watching you.

84
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Last year, we did something like Lee Japan.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
We did it.

86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
We did Kohaku.

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
It's a different genre.

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
We did something like Lee Japan.

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm going to turn it around.

90
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
I'm going to do my best.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Don't look at me like that.

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm going to do my best.

93
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Don't make him worried.

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

95
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,500
This year, we're going to do something like Lee Japan.

96
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm going to do my best.

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Don't look at me like that.

98
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

99
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

100
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:42,500
The 4th 2002 Hatsuharai Manzai University.

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,500
First, we're going to draw a number.

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
If you get it wrong this time, you're out.

103
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Don't put it in.

104
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Don't say you don't like this guy.

105
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Absolutely not.

106
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
If you say that, everyone won't like it.

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Manzai University's new year's project.

108
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
5 teams were selected from 25 talent staff.

109
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
It's a test of luck.

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
The fate is in this triangle.

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Did you say it?

112
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I have it.

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm going to draw the first one.

114
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Number 12.

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Who is it?

116
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Number 12.

117
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Isn't it Zaki?

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:44,500
That's right.

119
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Thank you, God.

120
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I'd like to decide on my partner.

121
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Number 23.

122
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Who is it?

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Number 23.

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Who is it?

125
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Next, the second team.

126
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Number 5.

127
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Who is it?

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
It's me.

129
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Tanaka.

130
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Tanaka's partner.

131
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Number 11.

132
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Who is it?

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:33,500
It's me.

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,500
This is a strange feeling.

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
The third team.

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
The first team to be selected is Yamaya.

137
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
His partner is...

138
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Director Sakamoto.

139
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:59,500
The fourth team is this person.

140
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
And his partner is...

141
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Number 1.

142
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:11,500
It's the same as last year.

143
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
It's the same as last year.

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Endo again?

145
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
It's the same as last year.

146
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
It's dirty.

147
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
The fourth team is Torio.

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,500
There are three people left.

149
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:40,500
This is a lie.

150
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
The first person is Torio.

151
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
The second person is Hotohara.

152
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Who is it?

153
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Number 9.

154
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Who is it?

155
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
It's me.

156
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Yamashita.

157
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Wait a minute.

158
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,500
If you come here, God will come down.

159
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
God can't come down on stage.

160
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,500
If you come here, God will come down on stage.

161
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Who is it?

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Who will be the last person?

163
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Come here.

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Who is it?

165
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Number 15.

166
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
It's me.

167
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,500
It's a lie.

168
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Wait a minute.

169
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Who is it?

170
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
It's a lie.

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
No one knows who is number 15.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,500
No one knows I'm number 25.

173
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:09,500
The first team is Yamasaki.

174
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,500
The fifth team is Torio.

175
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The sixth team is making up a story.

176
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
What kind of story will be completed?

177
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,500
It's perfect.

178
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Let's get started.

179
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Let's get started.

180
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
The first team is Hamada and Endo.

181
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
The theme is giving birth.

182
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Congratulations.

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
I'm Ichiro.

184
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm Shinjo.

185
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,500
We are the two of us.

186
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Last year, there were a lot of happy things.

187
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Last year, there were a lot of happy things.

188
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Everyone in the entertainment world was surprised.

189
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Her name is Kokomi.

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Her name is Yamachan.

191
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Her name is Zaki.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
She is about to give birth.

193
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
You will have a lot of memories if you get married and give birth.

194
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
I will do my best.

195
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
The recent generation has changed a lot.

196
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Husbands have to meet.

197
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I will study hard.

198
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Thank you.

199
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Wife, are you okay?

200
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Wait a minute.

201
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Don't tease me.

202
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Husbands are just watching.

203
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Don't tease me.

204
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,500
We are the major leaders.

205
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
What has changed?

206
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Husbands have to meet.

207
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
The moment of giving birth is in the video.

208
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Video shooting is important.

209
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
You were born like this after you were born.

210
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
It will be a good memory.

211
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Let's do it.

212
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Wife.

213
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
I can see you.

214
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Are you going to give birth?

215
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm going to give birth.

216
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
You were born like this after you were born.

217
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
We are the major leaders.

218
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Thank you very much.

219
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
How was it?

220
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
You are good.

221
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
The two teams are Tanaka and Miyasako.

222
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
The topic is the secret of Chihiro Sento.

223
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Let's do it.

224
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Hello.

225
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:58,500
We are the secret of Chihiro Sento.

226
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
How was it?

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,500
There were a lot of movies last year.

228
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Is there a movie that left a good impression on you?

229
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
There was a movie of Hayao Miyazaki.

230
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I can't remember.

231
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I remember.

232
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
I remember.

233
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
The secret of Chihiro Sento.

234
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,500
You did it.

235
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
You are the best.

236
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Did you know about the movie?

237
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
The movie that surpasses Titanic.

238
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I can't forgive you.

239
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
What do you mean?

240
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
You can't surpass the movie.

241
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Because it surpasses Titanic.

242
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I can't.

243
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Because it surpasses Titanic.

244
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I can't forgive you.

245
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
What?

246
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I can't.

247
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Stop it.

248
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
You have to start the movie.

249
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Do you want me to start the movie?

250
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Of course.

251
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Do you want me to forgive you?

252
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Of course.

253
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Give me that.

254
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
No.

255
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Don't touch it.

256
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Don't do it.

257
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Do not touch it.

258
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I'll start the movie.

259
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I'll tell you something.

260
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,000
What do you like about Miyazaki Hayao's movies?

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I love Laputa!

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's not true!

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I love Nausicaa the most!

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's definitely Laputa!

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,500
Hayao's movies are all about Nausicaa!

266
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
It's all about Laputa!

267
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It's all about Nausicaa!

268
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
I can't do any more comics!

269
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Please cheer up a little!

270
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Do you want me to cheer you up?

271
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Of course!

272
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Then give it to me this time!

273
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
No! Everyone's watching!

274
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Wait a minute!

275
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Give it to me!

276
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I'll hold it in for now!

277
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I got it!

278
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
You know what?

279
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
What is it?

280
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
There's actually a second edition of Sen and Chihiro's Kamikakushi!

281
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Really?

282
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
The title is already decided!

283
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
What is it?

284
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Sen Masao's Kinkakushi!

285
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Sen and Chihiro's Kamikakushi?

286
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Sen Masao's Kinkakushi?

287
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Say it!

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I've had enough!

289
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Thank you!

290
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Thank you very much!

291
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm sure they're talking right now!

292
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
That's right!

293
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Because I'm an idiot!

294
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
You're an idiot!

295
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Yeah!

296
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Bye-bye!

297
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
That's right!

298
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Thank you very much!

299
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Why do you all want to see the end of the story?

300
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
It's not over yet!

301
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
It's not over yet!

302
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
The third group is...

303
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Yes!

304
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Yamazaki Hosei and...

305
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes!

306
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Komurasaki!

307
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Yes!

308
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
The theme is Kouhaku Uta Gassen!

309
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Well then!

310
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Thank you!

311
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Thank you very much!

312
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
It's a bath!

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It's a toilet!

314
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's shake it together!

315
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
One, two!

316
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Life!

317
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
You're doing it wrong!

318
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
It's a bath!

319
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
What's that?

320
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
You're doing it wrong!

321
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Who's doing it wrong?

322
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
You're doing it wrong!

323
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Who's doing it wrong?

324
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm doing it wrong!

325
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
You're doing it wrong!

326
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Do it again!

327
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Thank you very much!

328
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
It's a bath!

329
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
It's a toilet!

330
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Let's shake it together!

331
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
One, two!

332
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Life!

333
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
You're doing it wrong!

334
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
It's a bath!

335
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Who's doing it wrong?

336
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I got it!

337
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I got it!

338
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
I got it!

339
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I got it!

340
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
I got it!

341
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
I got it!

342
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I get it!

343
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I get it!

344
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I get it!

345
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
What did you watch at the end of the year?

346
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
What did you watch?

347
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
I watched Kouhaku Uta Gassen at home with my family.

348
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
I also watched Kouhaku Uta Gassen!

349
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Did you watch Kouhaku Uta Gassen?

350
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I watched Kouhaku Uta Gassen.

351
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You shouldn't have watched it either.

352
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
That's right.

353
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't say it so casually!

354
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
There's a tomorrow.

355
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
There's a tomorrow.

356
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Let's sing it.

357
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Shall we sing?

358
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Let's sing.

359
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I'll do the bath.

360
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Everyone, please look forward to it.

361
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Look forward to it.

362
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
It's like this.

363
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Please.

364
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Look forward to it.

365
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Look forward to it.

366
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Please.

367
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Let's go.

368
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Let's go.

369
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Let's go.

370
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Next is the face vacuum.

371
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Wait!

372
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
What's wrong?

373
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Hamada-san, look down!

374
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Hamada-san, look down!

375
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Don't look down!

376
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:54,500
It's not the time to practice.

377
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Thank you very much.

378
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Thank you very much.

379
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:15,500
The topic is the Koizumi Prize.

380
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I will change the Japanese from now on.

381
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:26,500
First of all, as the founder of the Dozo reform.

382
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
This is called the cake recovery in the world.

383
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:42,500
It's a cake.

384
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
This is the sound.

385
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,500
The voice is coming out.

386
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Matsumoto-san, Hotaura-san, and Yamashita-san.

387
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
The topic is Hawaii travel.

388
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Please.

389
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Hello.

390
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
This is Spaghetti.

391
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Hello.

392
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
This is Spaghetti's Nakori-san.

393
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
This is Carbonara.

394
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
This is Donbe.

395
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,500
This is Spaghetti.

396
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:28,500
This is Spaghetti.

397
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
This is hard.

398
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
This is hard.

399
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
What are you looking at?

400
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
What are you looking at?

401
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
There's something in the middle of my face.

402
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
What?

403
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
There's something in the middle of your face.

404
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
That's a nose.

405
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
That's a nose.

406
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
That's a nose.

407
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
This is a big nose.

408
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
This is a big nose.

409
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
This is a small nose.

410
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
What are you doing?

411
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
What are you doing?

412
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
What are you doing?

413
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
What are you doing this New Year's Day?

414
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Can I ask you a good question?

415
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
As you can see, my face is sunburned.

416
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
I was making mochi at home.

417
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I was making mochi at home.

418
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I was making mochi at home.

419
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I was making mochi at home.

420
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm just repeating it.

421
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
You don't have to say that.

422
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
If you say that, did you go somewhere?

423
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I didn't go anywhere.

424
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I went to Waiha.

425
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I went to Waiha.

426
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I went to Waiha.

427
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
What do you mean?

428
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
What do you mean?

429
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I don't like it.

430
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I don't like it.

431
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You went to Hawaii.

432
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I went to Hawaii.

433
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
It's different from Japan.

434
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Japan is calm.

435
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Hawaii is very quiet.

436
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
The clear sky.

437
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,500
The wind is blowing.

438
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
That's right.

439
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I want to go to Hawaii, but I'm not good at English.

440
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I want to go to Hawaii, but I'm not good at English.

441
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,500
You can't speak English in an international society.

442
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
It's embarrassing.

443
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
If you go to Hawaii and say you're looking forward to it, you'll get a beating.

444
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
And I'll get a beating.

445
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
That's cool.

446
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Did you teach me?

447
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Really?

448
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Really?

449
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Really?

450
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Come on, come on.

451
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Come here, come here.

452
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
One more, one more.

453
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
I'll do my best.

454
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Come on.

455
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Nice, nice.

456
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Come on.

457
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Come on.

458
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
What do you mean?

459
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Did I do something wrong?

460
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
That's not it.

461
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
What's in your nose?

462
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,500
What's in your nose?

463
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
What's in your nose?

464
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,500
It's in the middle of your face.

465
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

466
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,500
It's in the middle of your nose.

467
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Thank you very much.

468
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,500
It was really an accident.

469
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
It was an accident?

470
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
It was a runaway.

471
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:55,500
It was a runaway.
