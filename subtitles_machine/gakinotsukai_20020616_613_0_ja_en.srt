1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The goal is to conquer the entertainment world!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The men will fly to the battle stage!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Osu! Ikidomebu! Part 2!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, this is the second time!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Last time, we lost, so the Ikidomebu was supposed to be gone.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Why is that?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I didn't say I'd do it again, but the staff really liked it.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It was naturally put together.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Last time it was 4 seconds.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, it was 4 seconds.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Last time, the opponents were the team from the office.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They were strong and had an overwhelming career.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yamasaki had the best record of 1 minute and 33 seconds.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They had a close fight.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, Hamada's time was unexpected, 9 seconds.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He lost in just 4 seconds.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Everyone did their best.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I didn't do my best!

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Please do your best again.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I didn't do my best!

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're an idiot!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He's been doing that a lot lately.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Ikidomebu isn't aiming to win.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is it for?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's for Ozonso.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're an idiot!

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He wants to escape.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But this time, there's one more person.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's right!

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He's a big shot in Hoshimoto.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This time, it's this person!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello! Nice to meet you!

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Nice to meet you!

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That was a close call.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't just say nice to meet you!

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hanako-neesan, how's the Ikidome?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm confident.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Really?

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In terms of seconds?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well...

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
1 minute.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The time is up.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
After 1 minute, it's 1 minute.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're starting to look like Hodo-chan.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do I look like Hodo-san?

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Leave it to me.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Leave it to you?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now then, let's have our opponents appear!

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ozonso!

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
3...2...1...

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What are you saying?

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Aren't you embarrassed, Mame?

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's Mame in the word.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I understand the meaning of this appearance.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Igi-Mame!

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey!

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mr. X!

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mame!

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're the leader.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's enough, Yugo-chan.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Today's opponents are the Ota-pro team!

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I see.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Toga-chan is here too.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He's been practicing a lot.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just once.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's a bit of a sportsman.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I see.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's been practicing a lot.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can't lose to him.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't understand why he's so hard to get along with.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's the same as last time.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In terms of time, the Ota-pro team won.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I see.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The order is like this.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I see.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I see.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yugo-chan, are you really okay?

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm okay.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By the way, who's the leader of the Ota-pro team?

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Leader?

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to be the leader.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Look at this muscle!

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's amazing.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who's going to be the leader?

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who's going to be the leader?

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I think I'm going to be the leader.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to be the leader.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you going to do?

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to be the leader.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Can you make me do it?

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can do it.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You should do it more than last time.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm really weak.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going to be the leader.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm going to be the leader.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Take it off.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's that?

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can't beat me with that muscle.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not a muscle match.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's right.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Take it off.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Take it off.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The leader of the Ota-pro team is Jimon Terakado.

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
His built-up body shows his progress.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know how far I can go.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't know how to aim.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll let Jimon be the leader of the Ota-pro team.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is very different.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's different when you do it and look at it.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I haven't been confident for a while.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a little different when you get in.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The pace is strange.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't breathe when I get up.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Jimon, I'll start when the water reaches here.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll start when the water reaches here.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay?

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ready.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Start.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think I can do it.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Jimon.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think I can do it.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What kind of face is that?

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't see the front.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm happy.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think I can do it.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Go.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like a demon.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't go.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't go.

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Jimon.

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't go.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Wait a minute.

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't go.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can't go.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're going.

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Awesome.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, go.

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Awesome.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think I can do it.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You can go.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh!

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh!

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He has some room for improvement.

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But it's not coming out of his nose yet.

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, wow!

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, wow!

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, wow!

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, wow!

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, wow!

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, wow!

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, wow!

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, wow!

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, wow!

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, wow!

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, wow!

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, wow!

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, wow!

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, wow!

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
14 mins!

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wow!

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Wow!

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Will Yagoto be as proud as he is now?

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is this a shelf?

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's get him to try after a minute.

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After 1 minute,

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Just get it in one try.

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
After 30 seconds,

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Just one time.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You have to go up to the 3rd floor.

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The first team is Kokoriko Tanaka.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
From the last record of 41 seconds, how much time will he extend?

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is the second time.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm used to it.

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How's the water temperature?

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The water temperature is getting warmer because it's cold today.

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ah, that's right.

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can you do it?

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes!

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's go!

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Ready!

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Start!

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I didn't make it.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's okay.

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is dangerous.

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The wind is blowing.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm counting on you.

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's really hot.

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's really hot.

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's really hot.

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm gonna try it.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He made it.

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm counting on you.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I made it.

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm counting on you.

207
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a piece of cake.

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a piece of cake.

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry, I'm drunk.

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You shouldn't have played with that.

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Something came out.

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Something came out.

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stop it!

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm not done yet!

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I forgot 30 seconds.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is amazing.

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can do it!

218
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can do it!

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't do it!

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't do it!

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
At this point, he started at 21 seconds.

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is amazing.

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know what's going to happen other than this.

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm going.

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop! Stop! Stop!

226
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Higo-chan, you can stop now.

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not going to be able to pull you back.

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who's going next?

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Next is Kannazuki.

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You know it, right?

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ouch!

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong with you?

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Cheer up!

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know what's going to happen if I don't do this.

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Who is this?

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's Hase.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hase?

238
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hase!

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's like Gin-san.

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hase, look.

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Look, look, look.

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't do it anymore.

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know anything about this.

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I wanted to see something else.

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, I'll do it like this.

246
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Wait a minute.

247
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I want to go next.

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Who?

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You.

250
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're going with Hama-chan?

251
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm going.

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Kota Pro-team.

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Jihon imitates a lot of athletes.

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How good is he?

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I went too far.

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Get ready.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Start!

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think that's how it's done.

259
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Slowly.

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He went in slowly.

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I thought it was going to be a good shot.

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's true.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What is this?

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to imitate something.

265
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're going to imitate something.

266
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wait, wait.

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to imitate something.

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going to die.

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's looking at me, but can he see me?

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can't see him, can you?

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't see him.

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to die.

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to die.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going to die.

275
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to die.

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Look to your right.

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't see you, can you?

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What was that?

279
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's only hire.

280
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I wanted to imitate Shin-chan, but...

281
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Is that how it's done?

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're weeding!

283
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going to cut my public.....

284
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Shin-chan! Shin-chan!

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm going to die.

286
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to die.

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Look to your right.

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't see you, can you?

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to die.

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's a false hope.

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's a good feeling

292
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The kids team, Jihou is Hamada

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The previous record was only 9 seconds

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Will this humiliating time continue?

295
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think I can do it

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If my ears start to hurt, I'll come up

297
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But don't think too much about it

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But if my ears start to hurt, I'll come up

299
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I won't go

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's go, Mr. Hamada

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Please

302
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do it at your own timing

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
At my own timing

304
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I did it

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's morning

306
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, it's going

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is a lot

308
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's going

309
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is bad

310
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's going

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was long, 14 seconds

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
14 seconds, okay

313
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What time is it?

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's hard

316
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's hard

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can only hold your breath for 14 seconds

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But you're eating a lot of noodles

319
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How many seconds did you hold the noodles?

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If it's a long noodle, you can hold it

321
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can hold it

322
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The other way

323
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Who's going next?

324
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mr. X

326
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Jihou

327
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Wait

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's Jihou

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The country is on your side

330
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Jihou, it's okay

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Auto Pro Team, the leader of the ostrich, Jihou Katsuhiro

332
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
His career is not to be underestimated

333
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Jihou, did you forget the noodles?

334
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I won the noodles

335
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay

336
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Jihou, it's okay

337
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's okay

338
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not a problem

339
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's okay

340
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Auto Pro Team wants to spread the lead

341
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Jihou opened 50 seconds with a relaxed expression

342
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The time difference with the ostrich team is 1 minute 25 seconds

343
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Look at this mayonnaise

344
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The ostrich team cannot lose

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yamazaki Hosei, who broke the record of 1 minute 33 seconds last time

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ready

348
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Start

349
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He looks like he's going to eat

350
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll give you 2 minutes

351
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It looked dangerous last time

352
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I did my best

353
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He looks like he's going to eat

354
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm ready

355
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He's crying

356
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He's crying

357
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He's crying

358
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He's crying

359
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He did this last time

360
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes

361
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Really?

362
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He's practicing

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's going well

364
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He's coming

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
40 seconds

366
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He was slow last time

367
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It comes

368
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What is this?

369
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He looks strong

370
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's coming

371
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's coming

372
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's coming again

373
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's coming

374
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm going to be called!

375
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's completely different from last time.

376
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Why?

377
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's because of my ability.

378
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You were good last time.

379
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Last time was a fluke?

380
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You were good last time.

381
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's because of my ability now.

382
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Then, let's copy Otaku's self.

383
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll show you! I'll show you!

384
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Nocchi Popon Nocchi Popon Nocchi

385
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Nocchi Ha To Doke

386
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Go! Go! Go!

387
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Nocchi Ha To Doke

388
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why did you start sleeping?

389
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It will be 12 o'clock soon.

390
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay!

391
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's exactly the same as my joke.

392
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're so annoying!

393
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're always talking!

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then, you're going to be the Park teacher.

395
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Thank you!

396
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hanako, are you going to go?

397
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes!

398
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Hanako, are you going to go?

399
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm going!

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What?

401
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm going!

402
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm going!

403
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm going!

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What's the meaning of that?

405
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hanako, go!

406
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Hanako, go!

407
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hanako, let's go!

408
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're dirty!

409
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's go!

410
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go!

411
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ready!

412
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Start!

413
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Did it stop?

414
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It stopped at the shallow part.

415
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It stopped at the shallow part.

416
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, it's small.

417
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you go down too much...

418
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm scared.

419
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What is it?

420
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What is it?

421
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a little bit of a side-eye.

422
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I see.

423
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're a woman.

424
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm a woman.

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're a woman.

426
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're a woman.

427
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're a woman.

428
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No way.

429
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But...

430
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's over!

431
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's over!

432
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's over!

433
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's over!

434
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's over!

435
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's over!

436
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's over!

437
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's over!

438
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's over!

439
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's over!

440
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's over!

441
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But I took it off at this stage.

442
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You took it off.

443
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's not good.

444
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What did you take off?

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I took it off.

446
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The name of the water pro team is dangerous Notch.

447
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The dangerous energy is an act of terror to the opponent.

448
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ready.

449
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's going, it's going, it's going.

450
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's going, it's going.

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's going, it's going, it's going.

453
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's going.

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's going.

455
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You can't do this to me.

456
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's going.

457
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's going.

458
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's going.

459
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, it came out.

460
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think you're doing something.

461
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's not good.

462
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's not good.

463
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's not good.

464
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's not good.

465
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Nice!

466
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nice!

467
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Nice!

468
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
6 seconds lead for Oda Pro.

469
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's not good.

470
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
6 seconds is not good.

471
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I want to make a difference here.

472
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I see.

473
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Ueshiba!

474
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Really?

475
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ueshiba-san.

476
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I want to go.

477
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I want to go.

478
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't want to be the last.

479
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't want to be the last.

480
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Endo, you can go.

481
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Endo, you can go.

482
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I have nothing.

483
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I have nothing.

484
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I have nothing.

485
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The target is Endo Kokoriko.

486
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The target is Endo Kokoriko.

487
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The record is 47 seconds.

488
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The winner wants to lead here.

489
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's a big deal.

490
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There are a lot of things floating.

491
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't like it.

492
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There are a lot of things floating.

493
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't say that.

494
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't like this.

495
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Something is floating.

496
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Endo shows his manliness here.

497
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The last record is far above.

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The last record is far above.

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The last record is far above.

500
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The weather team is under pressure.

501
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The weather team's target is the ostrich of the island.

502
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Will he show the miracle he did on the rice?

503
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There's a lot of floating.

504
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There's a lot of floating.

505
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There's a lot of floating.

506
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Are you ready?

507
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you ready?

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:09,380
this is such learning

509
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:16,300
I got it

510
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,140
I'll be in a bit

511
00:19:20,180 --> 00:18:56,020
a little bit more

512
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Oh oh oh oh

513
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Oh oh oh oh

514
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,020
It's still not good

515
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
Get down! Get down!

516
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
In the middle... oh, it's hard

517
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
10 seconds left!

518
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Go down! Go down!

519
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
A little more! A little more!

520
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
It's too early!

521
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,020
Yuu-chan, what's wrong?

522
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,020
Totton, Totton!

523
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Yuu-chan!

524
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,020
Yuu-chan!

525
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,020
What?

526
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,020
Yuu-chan!

527
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm so happy!

528
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,020
I'm so happy!

529
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
I'm so happy!

530
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,020
I want to close the door myself!

531
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
I'm so happy!

532
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm so happy!

533
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Wait a minute, I...

534
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,020
What's wrong?

535
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
Hey, help me!

536
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Wait a minute!

537
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Wait a minute!

538
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,020
What's wrong?

539
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
What's wrong?

540
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
The show has started!

541
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
I'm so happy!

542
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,020
I'm so happy!

543
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,020
I'm so happy!

544
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
I'm so happy!

545
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Are you okay?

546
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
You're drowning!

547
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,020
What happened?

548
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
I'm drowning!

549
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,020
I'm drowning!

550
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,020
I'm drowning!

551
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
I'm drowning!

552
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,020
I was going to dive again to cover that up.

553
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
The worst day...

554
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,020
This is how it started.

555
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
My father bought a two-bedroom house.

556
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Everyone in the family is going to live in it.

557
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
Everyone in the family is going to live in it.

558
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
But...

559
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
But...

560
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
But...

561
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
But...

562
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
But...

563
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
But...

564
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,020
But...

565
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,020
But...

566
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
But...

567
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
But...

568
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
But...

569
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,020
But...

570
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
But...

571
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
But...

572
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
But...

573
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
But...

574
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
But...

575
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
But...

576
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020

581
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Recently, I started to think that driving on a rainy day is not bad.

582
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Why is that?

583
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I am running with Legacy.

584
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,020
We are worried about the stain.

588
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,020
There, Heisei made a medicine to dilute the stain.

589
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020

Finally, the final match. The grand prize of the Gaki team is Matsumoto.

597
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
He is a man who is determined to survive.

598
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Hey, what are you doing?

599
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Why are you so bold?

600
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
Are you okay?

601
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
It was fun when I first started.

602
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
It was fun.

603
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,020
I'm scared. I'm scared.

604
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
I'm scared.

605
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm scared.

606
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
I'm waiting.

607
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Ready, start!

608
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Oh, it's hot.

609
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Why are you looking at me?

610
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
It was dangerous.

611
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,020
Why?

612
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
Why are you looking at me?

613
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Why are you looking at me?

614
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Open your eyes.

615
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
Hey, a little foam is coming out of my nose.

616
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
Open your eyes.

617
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Why don't you open your eyes?

618
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Oh, it hurts.

619
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
No, no, no, no.

620
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
It hurts.

621
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
It hurts.

622
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
It hurts.

623
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
No, no, no, no.

624
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,020
It hurts.

625
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,020
It's almost the end.

626
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,020
It's almost the end.

627
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Oh no.

628
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,020
That was close!

629
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
That was close!

630
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,020
That was close!

631
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Isn't the water in the pool weird?

632
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
It's really floating!

633
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
5 seconds in 1 minute.

634
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
This is bad.

635
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
This is bad.

636
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
He's the world champion.

I'm the Mongolian champion.

638
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,020
Will they be able to turn the tables around?

639
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,020
Huh?

640
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:24,020
In the end, they don't answer the question!

641
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,020
windshield wiper

642
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
windshield wiper

643
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Look, from the part where you blow

644
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
It's smooth

645
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
It's smooth

646
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
That's why it's Piore's smooth sheet

647
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
It's smooth with powder

648
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Piore

649
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,020
I hate studying, but there's a way to meet people

650
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,020
I want you to be kinder, bigger, and weaker

651
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
What's wrong with you?

652
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,020
There's a bad girl over there

653
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
That's right, it's Kotoruki

654
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:02,020
I'm Johnny

655
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,020
When I get on the train, I run to the bathroom and open the door

656
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Happy time

657
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
You can choose the taste

658
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,020
The taste of the sun

659
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020

Drink and be convinced

663
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,020
I want you to relax as much as possible for the first time

664
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,020
First, create an atmosphere that's easy to talk to

665
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,020
That's my job

666
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Thank you

667
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,020
First time

668
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
We're waiting for you at the ice cream shop

669
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,020

676
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
For 14 days

677
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Your hair will be healthy and shiny

678
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Pantene

679
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,020
Then

680
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Ah

681
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,020
What's wrong!?

682
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Why are you fighting so much?

683
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Thank you

684
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Calm down

685
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Come here

686
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
It's real

687
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,020
Ota Pro-team's grand prize is Tokashiki Katsuo!

688
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,020
The original boxing world champion's fighting spirit is exploding!

689
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Ready, start!

690
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,020
That way of entering is dangerous.

691
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
It opened.

692
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
I didn't know it would suddenly come.

693
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
It suddenly came.

694
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
It's stupid.

695
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,020
It's better to stop it this time.

696
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,020
It suddenly came.

697
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Calm down, calm down.

698
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
It's running now.

699
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
I did it like this, so I got it.

700
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,020
It looks like a demon.

701
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
It's suffering.

702
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Calm down, calm down.

703
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
1 minute, 1 minute.

704
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
It will definitely go in 1 minute and 5 seconds.

705
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Half.

706
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Half!

707
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
It's dangerous.

708
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,020
It's coming this way.

709
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
It's coming this way.

710
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
It's coming this way.

711
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
It's coming this way.

712
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
It's moving a little.

713
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
It's moving.

714
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
It's moving.

715
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
It's moving.

716
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
It's moving.

717
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
It's moving.

718
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,020
It's going down.

719
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Go up!

720
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,020
It's cool.

721
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:09,020
4 minutes and 39 seconds vs 5 minutes and 15 seconds

722
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Auto Pro Team

723
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
You're weak

724
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,020
I don't think I'm weak

725
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
It's because of Toga-chan

726
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
I'm sorry

727
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I'm not Toga-chan, I'm Shouhei
