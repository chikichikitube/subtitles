1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
After this, it's time for the 6th episode of Gaki no Tsukai!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 6th episode of Gaki no Tsukai!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The 200th anniversary of Tsukiji!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oogiri Daigassen!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is the 200th anniversary of Oogiri Daigassen,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we have one more guest.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The host is me, Hamada Masatoshi.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, let's have the talkers come up to the stage.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please introduce yourself.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I will never lose in a fight! I'm Yamasaki.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Next to you, please.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Next to you, please.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What's your name?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What's your name?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Jibin Onishi.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today, when I got on the train,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
a passenger on the train put gum on my head.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Didn't you say anything?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I thought, what the hell is he doing?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But I bit him.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Nice to meet you, too.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Next to you, please.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today, I went to the cultural festival of Seijo Gakuen,

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and there was a guy who said,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I know, I know, I was written by Noriyasu.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You did it?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, I did.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Next to you, please.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Next to you, please.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hey!

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's going on?

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What's going on?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's going on?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We've been thinking about it for a long time.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
First of all, the Dengon Game!

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everyone, please put on your headphones.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm going to make a lot of noise.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to say the words that I have in order.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please say them in order.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
First of all, the first topic is...

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here!

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You got it, right?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry, Ramos.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry, Ramos.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't move your mouth!

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You got it, right?

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, I don't.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Can you hear me?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's enough.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm a foreigner, Ramos.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's enough.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What?

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What?

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What?

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's move on to the next topic.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The next topic is...

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Read the Atakamo!

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here is a book.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Atakamo.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I hope you can read it as if you were writing it.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Please read it.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The first topic is...

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My long-distance love story.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
When I was in middle school,

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I was surrounded by everyone.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Because of that,

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
my beloved Michiko

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
was trapped.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I went to help her,

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and I was surrounded.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I managed to escape.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't make me laugh.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Here you are.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I asked her,

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What is that?

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I asked her,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was surrounded.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I was surrounded.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I asked her,

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was surrounded.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you understand?

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She was a child of Hamamatsu.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I told her,

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey,

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
are you...

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My love...

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Did you say something bad?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I went to help her.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't say anything bad.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I said I went to help her.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
She was saved because she was convinced.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why were you convinced?

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's too easy.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll make it easy.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll make it easy.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's what happened.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't do it.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What should I do?

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's go to the second question.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's change seats.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yamazaki-san and Oni-san.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The second question.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here you are.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ogasawara-ryu date-jitsu.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
When you go on a date,

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you do this and that.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is how you do it.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's read it.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Miyuki...

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, well, well.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, well, well.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, well, well.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm doing it for you.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Miyuki...

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
One foot first.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Go to Ogasawara-ryu.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Read this book.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I got it.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The way to fall in love with Ogasawara-ryu is written here.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
First of all, kiss.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Good.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's what it is.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is called A.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And then...

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well, various things.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, neckline.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, it's going to be.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't like them.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's difficult.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's going to be.

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But more important than that.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you write it, it's...

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mood.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Equal.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Place.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I see. That's what it is.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's what it is.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There is a place to bring on a date.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
One is a coffee shop.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And the other is a park.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The spring park is...

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Peaceful.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
After that, a boat came out.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Three birds.

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
At the edge of the pond.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
As if they were looking at us.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Embarrassed.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I was taking a walk.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What?

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I got it.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When we were looking at the birds.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We were too immersed in the pond.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We're both wet and naked.

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's cold, isn't it?

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's right.

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There was a hut.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's like a novel.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What's wrong with me?

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The air of love is flowing.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't have a normal edge.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm Ogasahara Ryu.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I used three flowers.

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
One is kiku.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The second is tulip.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The third is rindou.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How do you use it?

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
First, I put her on the bed.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
In rindou.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She...

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Like this.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The two of them...

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
As they are.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They look like flowers.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What are you doing?

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They look like flowers?

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What kind of flowers?

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then the two of them...

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They closed their eyes quietly.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Goodbye.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm sure there's no one like this.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You look good today.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you doing today?

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's a special occasion.

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There's nothing.

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Today's lunch is katsu-don.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, really?

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you very much.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There's no such thing.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's no flower.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know.

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
After it's over.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
After it's over.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
After it's over.

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When I go back to the dressing room.

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There must be something.

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's no sign of that.

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But that's how it is.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I haven't changed at all.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You've gotten stronger and stronger...

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why?

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
As a souvenir for the second time.

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I thought I'd say that to you.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why did you say I'm great?

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I wanted to say it off the top of my head.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I wore a tie too.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, it's always that way.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You've changed a lot since the show began, right?

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I haven't changed.

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I haven't changed at all.

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've changed.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I really haven't changed since my debut.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, that's not true.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I haven't changed at all!

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No, no, no, no.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, no, no, no.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If your attitude is good, I don't think there's anyone on your right.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In the entertainment world, it's either Yuji Oda or you.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No, it's...

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Young people also hate each other, right?

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What do you mean?

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, I'm not sure what to say myself, but we're pretty popular, aren't we?

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And there are a lot of young comedians these days.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They have their own followers.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, there are.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Right?

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I get angry when I see it.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When I see it, I say,

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll pull it out now.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't say it out loud.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I want you to stop it.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When I was a kid,

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Where was it?

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Sun Mall.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
When I went down the stairs of Sun Mall,

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was called Shetsu.

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It means forever.

265
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's Shetsu.

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I was called Shetsu.

267
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Did you say that to me?

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Did you say that to me?

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is there such a thing?

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you're my fan,

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't help it.

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why?

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, that's what it is.

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't like young people chasing me.

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm really angry.

276
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That young man in Osaka is amazing.

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Even if I'm walking around,

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm screaming.

279
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's so annoying.

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm Hamachan.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Soccer was good, wasn't it?

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What do you mean?

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What do you mean?

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What do you mean?

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I hate it.

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was going to watch it to the end.

287
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I was like,

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I did it!

289
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I jumped up.

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How was it?

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Everyone was disappointed.

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know what?

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's the preliminary round.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't you all forget that?

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If you didn't make it to the final,

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you wouldn't have made it to the main round.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Look, it's a comic book competition.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What are you talking about?

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But we all feel the same way.

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The preliminary round is amazing.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The comic book is...

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even if you make it to the preliminary round,

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
you can't be proud of yourself.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But it's a small town.

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's Osaka.

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You...

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Where are you going?

308
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What's the point of the preliminary round?

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What's the point?

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
When you fight for the championship in the main round,

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
everyone gets excited.

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I know that.

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But in the preliminary round in Asia,

314
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you have to fight so many fights.

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
How many fights are there?

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There aren't that many.

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Iraq, Iran, Korea...

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What is it?

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There aren't that many.

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And to win...

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There were so many in my time.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There was Tomizu.

323
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There was High Heel.

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There was also Ginji Seiji.

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There are so many.

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
When I was in high school baseball,

327
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
when I was in high school,

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I would cry and cheer for them.

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I told them to cheer for me like that.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
When I was in the preliminary round,

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
when everyone was practicing hard after school,

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I would say,

333
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
bye bye.

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Then I would say,

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I miss you.

336
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I know that.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I know that.

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But I don't know the rules.

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't care if you get angry at me.

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's your fault.

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What is offside?

342
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's scary.

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know at all.

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's not scary.

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When you say offside,

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm like, what?

347
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I get excited.

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And the old man,

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
he's like this.

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He's like this.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's hard to move.

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's like a character.

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's like a woman is being hooked.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What's that?

355
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's the big mole on Hamada's neck?

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This?

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What's good about Hamada?

358
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There's nothing good about him.

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
For example,

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
if you hit him with a highjack,

361
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the mole on his neck will break.

362
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's not good.

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's not good.

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Why is there a mole on my neck?

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What's that?

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What's that?

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's like Nacchan.

368
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's scary.

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why?

370
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There's nothing good about him.

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There's nothing good about him.

372
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There's nothing good about him,

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
but he's like Hifupyo.

374
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There's nothing good about him.

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The audience is going crazy.

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What did you say?

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
She's going to cry.

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What?

379
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's quiet.

380
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's your idea.

381
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's quiet.

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You should laugh.

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why are you serious when you talk about your girlfriend?

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Nacchan is hiding that he graduated from Harvard University.

385
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey.

386
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Don't talk to me.

387
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This is really funny.

388
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

389
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If I say that,

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What?

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I can't say anything.

392
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't say anything.

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can't say anything.

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
She's going to cry.

395
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's the second time.

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Who is that little man on Nacchan's right shoulder?

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He's drawing a picture.

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He's an old man.

399
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He's an old man.

400
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He's an old man.

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He's small.

402
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But everyone says that.

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like Shigorei.

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Shigorei.

405
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Everyone says that.

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I'm not Shigorei.

407
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm an old man.

408
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
How old are you?

409
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Are you that old?

410
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are you that old?

412
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What do you mean by that?

413
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Are you this old?

414
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No, I'm not that old.

415
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, I'm not that old.

416
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm this old.

417
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Right now, I'm at the top of my head.

418
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Your glasses will move.

420
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll do it myself.

421
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Did you do this?

422
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't do that.

423
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, well.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Get out of here.

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
My house has been in trouble for about three years.

426
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
When I went to the police for help, they said it was stolen from the outside.

427
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They said that if you dig in the house, it won't be stolen.

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I really want to catch this thief.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What should I do?

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But if they say that, you can't help it.

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's why I did it when I was in middle school.

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What?

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You stole my underwear?

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know.

435
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We met together, right?

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Leader.

437
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Leader?

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You always come to ask me out at night.

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You said, let's go.

440
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So I went to look for you.

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're really dirty.

442
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Am I really dirty?

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When I was in elementary school.

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll tell you our failure at that time.

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I went to Kawata's house.

446
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You have a dog.

447
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's right.

448
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Kawata had a dog.

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There was a dog under the bed.

450
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

451
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't like this dog.

452
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He was in the way and I couldn't catch him.

453
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I like dogs.

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But I wanted to kill the dog of Kawata.

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't call me Kawata.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
At that time.

457
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You should have prepared a fishing rod.

458
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's like this.

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Like this.

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You put it on like this.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You think I'm lying, don't you?

462
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No, it's true.

463
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You two took it like this.

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll do it now.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll do it now.
