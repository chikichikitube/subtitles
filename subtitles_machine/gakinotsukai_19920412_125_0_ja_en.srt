1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
After this, let's go to downtown Gakinosukai!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's watch TV as well!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today is the opening.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a little different from usual.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the past, when we were in Oogiri,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Mr. Uchida came.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Our manager had been doing it for 4 years.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He had been doing it.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In fact, on April 1st,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
he was ordered to leave.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He was told to go to the Nagoya office.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We left and went to Nagoya.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The man in charge of the Nagoya office,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Mr. Takeuchi,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
was also working there.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, that's right.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Takeuchi went to Nagoya to work.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He said, can't we work together?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's how this story began.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He was told to leave.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's been 4 years.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We have to do it properly.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We, including the staff,

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
want to celebrate

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the farewell

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
of the Gakinosukai-style band.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We want to sing a farewell song.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's right.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Finally, this day has come.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It seems like a sad and happy day.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't say that.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't say that.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you don't get angry,

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
there's nothing I can do.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Excuse me.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you for taking care of me for a long time.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to travel to Nagoya.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dad.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Say something.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Say thank you to your dad.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you for everything.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Dad.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Say something.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Just be careful with the water.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's beautiful,

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
isn't it, dad?

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who's going to return it to me?

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't say that.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thank you for waiting.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The bride and groom

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
have arrived.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Congratulations.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Congratulations.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Stop it.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why?

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't say bad things.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Stop it.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Congratulations.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Stop it.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Stop it.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Congratulations.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Congratulations.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's have a toast.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The composer of the Japanese TV program,

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Kenji Tsugawa.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's have a toast.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Cheers.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Congratulations.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's have a toast.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Cheers.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Takeuchi, I'm counting on you.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll be happy.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Be happy.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You have to do it well.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm hungry.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't say that.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not that kind of kid.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll give you some food.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Congratulations.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Congratulations.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Congratulations.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Stop it.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Your underwear is visible.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Have a good day.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Have a good day.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Have a good day.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go home.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go home together.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Cheers.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Cheers.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Cheers.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mr. Tsugawa, I'm counting on you.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm counting on you.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Cheers.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Cheers.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's cold.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Father, mother.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Atsuo's small chest is full of expectations and anxiety.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Atsuo was happy because he was always surrounded by love.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Atsuo is forever a child of father and mother.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please don't cry and send Atsuo out.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm relieved.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm relieved.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I want to have a child again.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I want to have a child again.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to have a child again.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I want to have a child again.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hello.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's over today.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It was a little late to start.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It was late to start.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Shut up.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you haven't seen the opening today, you'll know.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We've been apart for four years.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It was terrible at first.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't remember anything.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No way.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
At first, he didn't know what to do.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He didn't know how to be a manager, so he was standing next to me.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can't forget it.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was in Osaka and came to Tokyo.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I had a job in Tokyo.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I didn't know the staff in Tokyo.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't know what downtown was like.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I didn't know what downtown was like.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was sitting in the middle of a similar aura.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You go over there.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I was told that, but I gradually thought it was three people.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's okay.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He went to the Nagoya office in Yoshimoto.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He came to Okamoto.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's a little weird.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's a little weird.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He has a crybaby.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He has a crybaby.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He cut a cigarette.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He said,

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He came back in 15 minutes.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't have it.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't have a Marlboro light.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I don't have it, I don't have it.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know why he came here.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know why.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I said, come here.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He said, hold on a second.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I said, just go.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He said, Mr. Hamada, shouldn't you go home?

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What? Really?

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What do you think?

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I remembered something.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Nitta is really tough.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Really?

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Long time ago, he used to drink a lot.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He was so strong.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He went to a tea house in Kyoto.

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He drank a lot.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When I was in a taxi with him,

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
from Kyoto to Osaka,

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I said, I'm sorry, please stop.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please stop.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He stopped.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The door didn't open, but he opened the door.

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then he went out.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Please go.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Please stop.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Please stop.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He repeated that.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He didn't look at me.

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He didn't look at me.

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Are we looking for a blue bird?

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, really.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
First of all,

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
do you believe in supernatural powers?

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Actually, I do.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I believe in supernatural powers.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can see the other side of the wall.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, really.

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I can see the other side of the wall.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can see the other side of the wall.

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The other side?

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can see the other side of the wall.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What are you talking about?

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think Tsuttsun is preparing a letter.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Really?

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right?

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I know.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Tsuttsun must have a letter.

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right?

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I know.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Since there was something going on,

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I went up to the top of the post

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and spيت on Tsuttsun's body.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Tsuttsun's body made a house.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, no.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I went up to the top of his body.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I really don't believe it.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why?

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There really is no such thing.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You try it like this.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll go somewhere and see.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You'll definitely feel something.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Write that down.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I got it.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
When you feel something, write it down.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll go somewhere and see.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll go somewhere and see.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll go somewhere and see.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll go somewhere and see.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll go somewhere and see.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
When you feel something, write it down.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When you feel something, write it down.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's like saying you'll go somewhere and see.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There's something there.

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Write it down!

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you doing?

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hurry up and do it!

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm being told to hurry up and do it!

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't do it!

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You don't have the concentration.

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The person who does it and the person who gets hit shouldn't be able to concentrate.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Look!

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This!

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This!

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What?

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This!

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You idiot!

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There really is something.

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're an idiot.

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There really is something.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Is that so?

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Everyone watching this on TV, try it on the train.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You'll definitely feel it.

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When I was in middle school,

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the old man who used to be a salaryman,

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
he did it like this.

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He said,

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll definitely do it like that.

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Really?

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you don't do it, you'll definitely get hit.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is that so?

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Really, really.

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For example, if the people watching this do it,

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you can go home and think about it.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If you do it like Mach-chan said,

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
it'll be like this.

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Then you'll have to think about it again.

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, it's really not like that.

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, that's fine, but...

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't have a spiritual sense.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What? Ah, spiritual sense.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't have a spiritual sense.

273
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm a sadist.

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're a sadist.

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't have a spiritual sense.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why?

277
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you sleeping properly?

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm not sleeping.

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When I sleep,

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I always sleep like this,

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
as long as I have a spiritual sense.

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So when I'm really tired,

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think,

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I might have a spiritual sense today,

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll definitely sleep like this.

286
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's strange, isn't it?

287
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why did you become a sadist when you were like this?

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you're like this,

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
don't you tie up your spiritual sense?

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't tie up my spiritual sense.

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't tie up my spiritual sense.

292
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's scary, isn't it?

293
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's scary, it's scary, it's scary.

294
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you look at yourself in the bathroom,

295
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you're a real sadist.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In the bathroom?

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's why I told you not to turn around,

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
but when I'm in the bathroom,

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I always turn around like this.

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll go down, I'll go down.

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's this, isn't it?

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, it's not.

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not like that normally.

304
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Like this, like this,

305
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
do you go out like this?

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you go out like this?

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't go out.

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
When I'm done, I go out like this.

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What do you mean?

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There's something like this.

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The toilet seat.

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

314
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And when you're done, you go out like this?

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I go out like this.

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There's something like this.

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
When you're done,

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
when you're like this,

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you look back.

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
When I go in,

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I suddenly look back.

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't open the toilet like this.

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No, when I go to the bathroom,

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I go like this.

327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What?

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
When I'm like this,

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I go like this.

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
When I'm like this,

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
do you go out like this?

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't you forget how to do this?

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
There's something like this.

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes, there is.

337
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Occasionally.

338
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes.

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There are times when you go out like this.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes.

341
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's strange.

342
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's always like this.

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Is the toilet in middle school like this?

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's right.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, it's wrapped.

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't wrap it.

347
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wait for the toilet.

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The toilet paper is here.

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The toilet paper is here.

350
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Seriously, seriously, seriously.

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why is your head like that?

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I failed.

353
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hello.

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I fell in love with the toilet paper at first sight.

355
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's a lie.

356
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't live without the toilet paper.

357
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Does the toilet paper have a girlfriend?

358
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What kind of food do you like?

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Please tell me more about the toilet paper.

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Please.

361
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What about the toilet paper?

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Does it have a girlfriend?

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm in Tokyo right now,

364
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
so I don't have a girlfriend.

365
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh.

366
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Did you have a girlfriend when you were in Osaka?

367
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I had a girlfriend when I was in Osaka.

368
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I didn't have a girlfriend when I came to Japan.

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, a little while ago.

370
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes.

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How did you know?

372
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, there were a lot of fights.

373
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There were a lot of situations.

374
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's wrong with you?

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What are you trying to change?

376
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's wrapped, but it's in front of a man.

377
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, is that so?

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's like this.

379
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You look like you made it with a pine tree.

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes, thank you.

381
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, is that so?

382
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, I'm glad that this kind of thing is coming.

383
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, it's still one.

384
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I have a question for the downtown officer.

385
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I saw someone stealing gasoline at the parking lot the other day.

386
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What should I have done at that time?

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Keep it quiet.

388
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can't do that.

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
How can you treat a criminal like that on TV?

390
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's bitter.

391
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What are you doing?

392
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What are you doing?

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, that's true.

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I used to have a dog.

395
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It barks.

396
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
At that time, I had a brother and a father.

397
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was the only man.

398
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Bang, bang, bang.

399
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Bang, bang, bang.

400
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A dog was crying.

401
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And the dog is crying.

402
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Who is it?

403
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't know.

404
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Akiko?

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm scared.

406
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm scared.

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You don't have to say it twice.

408
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's been a long time since I've seen a dog crying.

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I want to see it.

410
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, I have to show you what I did there.

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's right.

412
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm the only man.

413
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

414
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, I'm the only man.

415
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's enough.

416
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm the only man.

417
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you open the window of the toilet, you can see the dog.

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If you open the door, a scary man is peeing on the dog.

419
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The dog is crazy.

420
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The dog is crazy.

421
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a poor dog.

422
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's a scary man.

423
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you doing?

424
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm peeing on the dog.

425
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I opened the door and peed on the dog.

426
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was scared.

427
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I closed the door.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Nothing happened.

429
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Nothing happened to the dog?

430
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Nothing happened to the dog.

431
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's okay, it's okay.

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I want you to take the dog for a walk.

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I see.

434
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I see.

435
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But the dog ran away.

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In that situation, I can't say anything.

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You should talk to the dog.

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Last week, the dog was on vacation.

439
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes.

440
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Last week, the dog was on vacation.

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Last week, Yamazaki and I were on vacation.

442
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It was very cold.

443
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was waiting for the dog to be on vacation.

444
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I see.

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Then, Yamazaki ran away.

446
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
After a while, I ran around Shinjuku.

447
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Did you run out of gas?

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, I ran out of gas.

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You are not good at running.

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why didn't you check the gas?

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's cold.

452
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's cold.

453
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's very cold.

454
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Then, Yamazaki caught a taxi and went to the gas station.

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The gas was frozen and I couldn't go home.

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
While I was going to Yamazaki, it was very cold.

457
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I couldn't wear a heater.

458
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It was snowing.

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
About 30 minutes later, I came back to Yamazaki.

460
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The gas station clerk said.

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That facility cracked.

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The subscriber went to Yamazaki?

463
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He was very angry.

464
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He is crazy.

465
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He is insane.

466
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He practicing his Squatch skill.

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Is he insane?

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He is very crazy.

469
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The subscriber was very angry.

470
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He was crazy.

471
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
When he was operating on his looking.

472
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm a cat!

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's right!

474
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What am I supposed to do?

475
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you saying? You're a cat!

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're making it sound like I'm saying it?

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm making it sound like I'm saying it!

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ah, really?

479
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm drooling!

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And my nose is running too

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm like, kachakachaa! But it's completely unresponsive

482
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's right

483
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even though it's cold, I open it and

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I like the nozzle so

485
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How do you say it? The place where you put the gasoline

486
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It doesn't go in that easily

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It goes in like this

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's convenient

489
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I see

490
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It doesn't go in

491
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's really stupid

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What should I do with this store?

493
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's easy to scratch, but it's like this on the side

494
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's fun!

495
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yamaguchi is saying something great!

496
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Momoko, go over there!

497
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What should I do with this?

498
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yamaguchi said, go borrow something

499
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's like an udon restaurant

500
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If you go there, there won't be anything

501
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The old man there is doing a good job

502
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But he doesn't feel like he's done anything

503
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He doesn't have anything

504
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yamazaki, go borrow a donburi bowl!

505
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He's putting it in the donburi bowl

506
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He's putting it in the donburi bowl

507
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He's putting it in the donburi bowl

508
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He's putting it in the bowl

509
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He's putting it in the bowl

510
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He's saying, that's enough

511
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then he's like, is there anything else?

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And then he's like, is there anything else?

513
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And then Yamazaki puts out something new

514
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Something evil

515
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He came out with a beer bottle.

516
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I said, I don't know anything about machines.

517
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He said, if you wash it once, it will explode.

518
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I said, it will, right?

519
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He said, it won't.

520
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It won't explode.

521
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It won't explode.

522
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But he didn't care about it.

523
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
He put it in the beer bottle, and it exploded again.

524
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He did it again.

525
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It went in.

526
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It was a huge success.

527
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It went in.

528
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It was a huge success.

529
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He told me to return the bottle.

530
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I had to return it.

531
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I see.

532
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I had a fever at that time.

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I couldn't bear it.

534
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I had to return it.

535
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I had a fever at that time.

536
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn't have enough gasoline.

537
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I had to return the bottle.

538
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The gas tank was empty.

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I didn't have enough gas.

540
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I pushed the gas tank.

541
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It exploded.

542
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It was strange.

543
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You were saying,

544
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was saying,

545
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Who did I say?

546
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Is that what you call a disaster?
