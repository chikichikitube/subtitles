1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's time for Guda Guda Gainin's Regular Kaktop show!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today, I feel like I've been very calm since before the show.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I think I'm going to stay calm from now on.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The main character is Guda Guda Gainin.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
To put it simply, the show has changed a lot at this time of the year.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A new show has started from spring.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
From now on, the number of regular viewers will continue to decrease.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There will be fewer and fewer.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today, the people in charge of each show have gathered.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This time, 18 people from Japan TV and the staff of the show will be in charge of the screening.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
When all the Guda Guda Gainin's content is over, they will choose the person they like.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who will get the regular viewers?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I wonder why the fun entertainment is coming.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You have a lot of fun entertainment.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's get started.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The first person, please.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you very much.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The first person, please.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll do my best.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're nervous, aren't you?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Of course.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are the regular viewers?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There are two of them.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What are they?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In TV Saitama, there are four seniors, Gokuraku Tomo and Supadaka Bokujo.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Supadaka Bokujo!

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's get a good job.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll do my best.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you ready?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You don't have to be nervous anymore.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You don't have to be nervous anymore.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm already excited.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you ready?

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm going to do a show where I eat takoyaki and milk.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm going to do that.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your pronunciation is bad.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you doing?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to beat you up.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What did you say?

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to do a show where I eat takoyaki and milk.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Takoyaki and milk.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Takoyaki and milk.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Takoyaki and milk.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You do it.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you very much.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to do a show where I eat takoyaki and milk.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The end.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is Kumamoto TV.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Mr. Ogawa.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What do you think?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Squid and octopus move a lot.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Octopus is more difficult.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Octopus is more difficult.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Which one is more difficult?

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mr. Ogawa, you just saw it.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's okay.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Everyone, please.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mr. Ogawa.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
12 years of career.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Ogawa.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you very much.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How old are you two?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm 37 this year.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have a child in May.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He is the younger one of us.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think so.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you going to do today?

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is thanks to our old age.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think you're being too old.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you going to do today?

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are we doing today?

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are we doing today?

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Today, we are going to drink a bucket of water.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
A bucket of water?

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Not a normal bucket of water.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please look at the other side of the curtain.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please open it.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How long is it going to take?

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hmm...

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is...

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is...

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's called the year of the monkey.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everyone, please stand by.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ah...

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mr. Hamada.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's hard to get involved.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Everyone, I'm going to drink a bucket of water.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll do my best.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll do my best.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He's drinking it now.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll do my best.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's drinking it now.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He's drinking it now.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to see him drinking it.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you pulling it?

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm not pulling it.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm watching you.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's drinking a lot.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's okay.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you don't want to get involved, drink from that side.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't feel good.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, it's over.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Turn around.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hello.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you very much.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How was it for you guys?

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Ah, is that so?

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's really hard.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Shizuoka Daichi TV, Mr. Yasuoka.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you do a lawn mower?

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I have a lot of energy.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Will it be on camera?

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Maybe.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll ask the viewers to help me.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Anything is fine.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
TV, please.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's good.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Anything is fine.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is there anything you want to show?

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This one.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Magical brain power.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sorry, Magical.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Magical, how was it?

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you very much.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's different from what the show wants.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a shame.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why don't you do Magical Banana here?

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How about doing it in the water tank?

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Magical Banana.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That kind of talent show.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He's shaking his head all the time.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm in trouble.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you haven't seen it, please watch it.

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Magical Banana

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's your name?

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm Oosei Yamazaki.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's your regular job?

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have 9 jobs.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You have 9 jobs?

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
9 jobs?

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What do you have?

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I can't cut my hair.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't say that.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You said you have 9 jobs.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you mean you can't cut your hair?

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's fine.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But when I watched your previous shows, I got angry.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I see.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll show you the real talent.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're pretending.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What are you trying to do?

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll do it.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Did you just see my butt?

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't pull it.

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't pull it.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What are you doing?

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you doing?

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hello.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Be quiet.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you ready?

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What are you doing?

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm in a bad mood.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing with this atmosphere?

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Zusho from Sapporo TV.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Can you play on a snowy day in a cold place?

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Can I play on a snowy day?

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Are you sure?

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Can I ask you a question?

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What?

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you sure?

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Have you ever been on a show?

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Really?

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I didn't do any airing.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You didn't do any airing?

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I didn't check it.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, I'll let you do it.

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is the last one.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The last one.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't think there's anything.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really?

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't think there's anyone who wants to do it.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I see.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't know what it is.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the last one.

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a mistake.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's a mistake.

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What are you going to do?

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You can do it, right?

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can do it.

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have a lot of books.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Books.

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How many years have you been in this world?

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
25 years.

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
25 years.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I have a lot of books.

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All of them are empty.

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm looking forward to it.

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really?

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know where the key is.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's nothing, but let's show it a little.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Shall we?

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please show something today.

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
One or two.

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a waste.

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's okay, isn't it?

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A face copy.

228
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Welcome back, Onoda-san.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's old.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I saw it many years ago.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Which program?

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
After that.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Where is the regular?

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It hasn't been decided yet.

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
After this, you can't make a face like that.

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey, mister.

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What?

238
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is that all?

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What?

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Can't you do anything else?

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Shall I open another drawer?

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I haven't opened it yet.

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's been a long time since I came here.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is the super power of the boom.

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Boom?

246
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's the idea of an old man.

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's a moment.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This finger.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll pierce through anything.

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Here we go.

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The muscle.

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm laughing.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't laugh.

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why can't you tell the difference?

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll be busy with this.

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll be busy with this.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll be busy with this.

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
After this, the results of the big wave.

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's far beyond my imagination.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The results are far beyond my imagination.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you for your applause.

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you.

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How are you doing recently?

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm still good today.

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What's good?

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know.

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's good.

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is good.

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you.

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can see this dirty mole from your sweater.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you say that, your nose will be dry.

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's natural that my nose will be dry.

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's natural that my nose will be dry.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's not dirty.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't feel good.

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't feel good.

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Why is your mole so three-dimensional?

279
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't like it.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll take it off.

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't take it off next week.

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I can't take it off.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll burn it with a laser or something.

286
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If I have this, I'll get cancer.

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is not good.

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't have a three-dimensional mole on my body.

289
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why is it three-dimensional?

290
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know why you asked me.

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can't see the skin on the neck by this three-dimensional mole.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's such a small area.

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can't see it.

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I want to see the other side.

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't stand it.

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I can't see it from the other side.

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I heard that the taxi driver Matsumoto-san has a secret route to go to Tokyo and Osaka in 15 minutes.

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Please tell me where that road is.

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The story is originally a colorful one.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I see.

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not 15 minutes, is it?

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But it's an hour and 20 minutes.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Please tell me what kind of road it is.

304
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's Osaka, right?

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, um...

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Koshu Kaido.

307
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Koshu Kaido?

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You have to go to Osaka from O-gyo.

309
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You have to go to Koshu Kaido.

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're annoying.

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's why no one notices.

312
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The secret route.

313
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you know that?

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There's Kanpachi, right?

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

316
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Kanpachi.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
After crossing Kanpachi,

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
there's a side road here.

319
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Where is it?

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There's a lot of things on the side road.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's not true.

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Where is it?

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There are many things on Kanpachi.

324
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Where are you talking about?

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's right.

326
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's Kanpachi, right?

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There are many things on the side road.

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's not true.

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Koshu Kaido.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You like that, don't you?

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There are times when you have to go to Kanpachi on Koshu Kaido.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Right?

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There are, but you can't go in from many places.

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Koshu Kaido is that.

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is Shinjuku.

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes.

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Right?

338
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You can go all the way to Koshu Kaido, right?

339
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you listening?

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why is it like this?

341
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can go to Koshu Kaido, right?

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right?

343
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There are a lot of things on the side road.

344
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You can go like this, right?

345
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
On the side.

346
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There are things on the side road, too.

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Are there things on the side road, too?

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There are things on the side road, too.

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There are Kanpachi, right?

350
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There are Kanpachi, too.

351
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There are Kanpachi, too.

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Right, there are Kanpachi, too.

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There are Kanpachi, too.

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There are, but they're not vertical.

355
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I know, I know.

356
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There are Kanpachi, right?

357
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Kanpachi.

358
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There are Kanpachi.

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you go this way,

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you can go to the Koshu Kaido.

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I know, I know.

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is the Takai-do side, right?

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is the Takai-do side.

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you don't go either way, you'll go straight.

365
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Straight?

366
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Which way is straight?

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm getting angry.

368
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's the side road, right?

369
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Which way is straight?

370
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Tell me!

371
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you go to the Koshu Kaido, it's the Koshu Kaido.

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's like this with Kanpachi.

373
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, that's right!

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, that's right!

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're going to the Koshu.

376
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Right?

378
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're going to the Koshu.

379
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, that's right.

380
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm going to the Koshu.

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There's Kanpachi, right?

382
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's the Koshu Kaido, right?

383
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're going to the Koshu.

384
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If you cross Kanpachi, it's right here.

385
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It goes diagonally.

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What's that?

387
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There's a road.

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

389
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The old Koshu Kaido.

390
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, the old Koshu Kaido.

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's right.

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But you're going to the Koshu Kaido at the end.

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're going straight.

394
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're going this way.

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's what it's about.

396
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You sounded like you were going to the Koshu.

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I said the Koshu.

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He wrote the graduation thesis on DNA and human anatomy.

399
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He wrote the graduation thesis on DNA and human anatomy.

400
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There are many things that humans have. Some people get so excited when they are stepped on the face.

401
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Is there anything else that gets you excited when you are stepped on?

402
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
M and S are interesting. I'm doing research on them.

403
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
When you go to a store, you go like this.

404
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a B course.

405
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
A course you don't even know.

406
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm still like that.

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're still stepped on?

408
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm stepped on.

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Who is he?

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He's a high school S.

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What do you mean by high school?

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Middle school and high school.

413
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're so annoying.

414
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is the 4th time.

415
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's high. It's high.

416
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's high. It's high.

417
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's high?

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I feel like I'm different.

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not different at all.

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're the one who gets stepped on, right?

421
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm the one who gets stepped on.

422
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not good with words.

423
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I saw a kid using it.

424
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It wasn't funny.

425
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When he said that, I was like, wow, it's not funny.

426
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
B!

427
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Someone come here!

428
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's a lie, but...

429
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's too late for that.

430
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The most amazing thing I've ever experienced was...

431
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
when the queen came with 5 or 6 people.

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Isn't that a special course?

433
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
She came out and said, who are you?

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What are you doing here?

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
She said, where are you putting the kotatsu?

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
She took the kotatsu to the living room.

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's a kotatsu?

438
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
She took the kotatsu from the living room to the living room.

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was so excited.

440
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Wait a minute.

441
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Wait a minute.

442
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Are you going home?

443
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's right.

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're not going to the store?

445
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's right.

446
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're not going to the store?

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're not going to the store?

448
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm going to go in like this.

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you doing?

450
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What are you doing here?

451
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You took the kotatsu to the living room.

452
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
She changed the whole pattern of the room.

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
She denied my life.

454
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
She denied my life.

455
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The telephone line was cut off, and the water pipe was cut off, too.

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
My lifeline was cut off.

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I was really excited.

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
My life was...

459
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank you very much.

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We don't have much time today.

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's right.

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Thank you very much.

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, no, no.

464
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We'll come back again later.

465
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Next time.

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Next time.

467
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Next time, we'll have another combination.

468
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Next time, Yamasaki will come out.

469
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yamasaki will come out.

470
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Thank you very much.

471
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Thank you very much for today.

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Look forward.

473
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What are you doing?

474
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Thank you very much.

475
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You can't end it like that.

476
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You can't end it like that.

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You can't end it like that.

478
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You can't end it like that.

479
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Now, let's introduce ourselves one more time in order.

480
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We'll see if the cards go up or not.

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's like this.

482
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Now, number one.

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes.

484
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Entry number one.

485
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's go here.

486
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I did my best.

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Thank you very much.

488
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Now, even if it's regular, it's a good card.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Here you go.

490
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's been a long time.

491
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you very much.

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's good.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's good.

494
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's good.

495
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's good.

496
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's good.

497
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's good.

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's good.

499
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's good.

500
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The winter was cold.

501
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That was a bit.

502
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Still good.

503
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That was a bit.

504
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's still good.

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's still good.

506
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's still good.

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's still good.

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's still good.

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Number two.

510
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's the summer ofgang.

511
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's do things this year.

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Thank you very much.

513
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Everyone who wants me to hug Little Nanas head-on.

514
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Everyone, please show us your placards!

515
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
No way!

516
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Really?

517
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Really?

518
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No way!

519
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's a new one!

520
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What are you going to use?

521
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to use it for the reenactment of the video.

522
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's great!

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's great!

524
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
My heart is beating so fast!

525
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's do it!

526
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No.3!

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes!

528
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yamazaki Yose!

529
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I did my best!

530
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I said there were 9 rules, but 5 of them will be over by the end of spring!

531
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That's too early!

532
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Please take care of me!

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't lie to me!

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're laughing all of a sudden!

535
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's go! Yamazaki, you can use me as the reenactor.

536
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Everyone, please show us your placards!

537
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, Shizuoka!

538
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There were 3!

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes!

540
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Tamushi Yenge, what should I do?

541
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What should I do?

542
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The last one is Mister!

543
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm not going to do this!

544
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Really?

545
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm not going to do this!

546
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If I say I'm the star, it's going to be Momoe-chan!

547
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is Momoe-chan!

548
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is the last one!

549
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Please take care of me!

550
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Everyone, please show us your placards!

551
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's you!

552
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Please give him a round of applause!

553
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
He's so busy!

554
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
He's holding his body!

555
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Sekai Warumiya-san, you're going to do it too, right?

556
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes, as a guest.

557
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Sekai Warumiya?

558
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
