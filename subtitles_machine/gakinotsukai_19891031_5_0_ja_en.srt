1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We are now at the station of Monzennaka-cho.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I have no idea where we are.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Last week, we wanted to go to a place where there are no people at all.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We wanted to go to a place where there are no people at all.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Suddenly, you got on the subway.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The meaning is different.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We went to Toyo-cho, which is two stations away.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did you go?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, I did.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The girl's nape is like this.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Like this.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Can you point at her?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Can you point at her?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Are you pointing at the girl's nape?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This girl's nape is like this.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How about this girl?

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, close your eyes.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Where are you going?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going home.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Be careful.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
She's dyed her hair.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where are you going?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll shake your hand.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Where are you going?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What are you doing?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you're going to see her, take her with you.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you going to do?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're going, aren't you?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What are you doing?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What a big dog.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, come here.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What are you doing with that dog?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't you do anything to people who are walking?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll bite your nape.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You'll bite my nape?

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You'll bite my nape?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Idiot.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm at Wakatake today.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There are already a lot of dirty people here.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Already.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mom.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where is your mom?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you very much.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is downtown.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Downtown.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's like a

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you buy this for me?

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is the most expensive show I've ever been on.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is the most expensive show I've ever been on.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's beautiful.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Amazing.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you turn on the lights, it's going to be cool.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've been walking for a long time.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Shall we start?

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's start.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is Wakatake.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's have a lot of fun.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you very much.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Have a nice day.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's fun.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This program is brought to you by Toyo Suisan, Oyama International Products, and these sponsors.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you very much.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you very much.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you very much.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you very much.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you very much.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you very much.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is the fifth time.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's the fifth time.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
To be honest, this is the most painful show I've ever been on.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There are many guys here.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There are a few guys today.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Depending on where you are, there is a theatre nearby.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Most of the people there come.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's also a young guy called Otoyan.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I wonder how much they'll understand.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I think it's difficult.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Today's the 5th time, so I have to change the topic every time.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have to change it so that they can hear the new one.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The topic is almost gone, and it's hard to speak clearly.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's a very difficult situation.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's no use saying it.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So today, say anything. I'll do anything.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There's a lot of good stuff.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have a lot of good things.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have a lot of good things.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll give you one.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is the most popular topic.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There's a chocolate pocky.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Or you can put it in your ass and change it to a pretz.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't take it.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is good.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is good wherever you go.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can do the opposite.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can do the opposite.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can't take a pretz.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't do it.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll change it to something I say.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll take it too much, so if I do more, it'll be a strawberry pocky.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Stop it.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll take this.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have a lot of good things, but I'm scared of the TV show.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It doesn't matter if it's summer or winter.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It doesn't matter if it's summer or winter.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a world you don't know.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
For example, if it's a basic person, it's a mental picture.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
An old man comes out and explains.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is an example of something.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's scary, isn't it?

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
For example, a hand was reflected on the shoulder.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you know?

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I took a commemorative photo with a friend.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A hand was reflected on the shoulder of a person.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Bang!

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ah!

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Where is it?

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's there.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A hand was reflected on the shoulder.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A hand was reflected.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When I took a picture, there was an officer of the Self-Defense Force standing behind me.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's not true!

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll take a picture, but you're not in the Self-Defense Force.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There's nothing behind you.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's just behind you.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's nothing behind you, but there's a hand behind you.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's the kind of person you are.

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's not true!

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey!

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm staying at home!

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't trust the self-defense photo.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There's more.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The officer of the Self-Defense Force.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you know?

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Do you know?

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
When I took a picture.

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Here.

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Around the waist.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The officer of the Self-Defense Force.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He has a cut on his forearm.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
His head is rough.

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
His face is covered in blood.

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If something were to happen, would he have a cut on his forearm?

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What do you mean by what would happen?

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you asking if something is wrong or not?

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you asking what would happen?

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is it about the service?

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What's wrong with that?

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If something were to happen.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What would happen?

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Your arm is cut!

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If something were to happen, would you have a cut on your forearm?

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm definitely sure.

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That disgusting face was on the back of my waist.

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Bam!

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ahhhh!

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm a servant of the government.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
On the waist?

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The disgusting part?

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Here?

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Here?

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's a...

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Poset.

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're lying!

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you wear that disgusting poset, I'll kill you!

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm telling you to kill me!

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No.

171
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where do you sell those posets, you idiot?

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I sell them at Tokyo Hands.

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The blue part here is just right and you can wear anything.

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're lying! You're lying, you idiot!

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't believe it.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're lying, lying, and you're walking down the street and your shoulders are touching...

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah!

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Just walking down the street and being a busybody is a lot of fun these days.

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's nothing wrong with that. What's wrong with that?

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You just walk down the street and in some unknown street you pass by and your shoulders are touched

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and you don't care about that.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When I came back home, I saw blood all over my shoulder.

183
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you doing?

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you a little drunk?

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The sponsor is...

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What is that?

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There is only 4% alcohol in it.

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't drink any more.

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's too much.

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a little different from usual.

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's called the 3-piece.

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't care.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I was touched by the sponsor.

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I was touched by the sponsor and went home.

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was bleeding.

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's scary.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm the only one who's scared.

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I was touched by the sponsor and went home.

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I was more scared.

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What?

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was scared of the park near my house.

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I heard it and everyone screamed.

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Stop talking.

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll tell you a story.

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
About three years ago,

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I was walking alone in the park near my house.

207
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I saw a man with a pale face coming down from the slide.

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Brother, brother.

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was touched by the sponsor.

210
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When I looked back, the man was gone.

211
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I went to the jungle gym.

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
When I got home, I saw blood all over my shoulder.

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's dirty.

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's scarier than death.

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's scarier than blood all over your shoulder.

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's scarier than poop.

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's scary.

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's scarier than death.

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you eat too much peanuts,

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
your nose will come out.

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you eat too much peanuts, your nose will come out.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you eat too much peanuts, your nose will come out.

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's scarier than death.

225
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you are a detective or a police officer,

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and a murder happened somewhere,

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
where is it?

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's in the apartment.

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Go and open the door of the apartment.

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There is a body covered in blood.

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There is a body covered in poop.

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Which one will you kill?

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If there is such a person,

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll kill him with a stick or something.

235
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If there is such a person, I'll kill him with a stick or something.

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What do you know about the body covered in poop?

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are talking nonsense.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You are saying that it's scarier than death.

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm not saying that.

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm saying that I have a spirit.

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You have a spirit.

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There is still something scary.

243
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You have to listen to me.

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you know?

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There is a woman who lives alone.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There is a woman who lives alone.

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He sits in front of the church.

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He is prayerful.

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He isn't talking to his grandfather who died three years ago.

251
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He can feel lonely because he is alone.

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Heís talking to his grandmother.

253
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The woman in the back acts as if she was siebie.

254
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The woman in the back acts as if she wasitié.

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And he is very quiet.

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You are saying that you want to go to see the mother of the dead.

257
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are saying that you want to go to see the mother of the dead.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you know what means?

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know what this is.

260
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What the scary story is.

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The old lady, even though she was dead, she didn't accept it, so she sat in front of the Buddha's altar by herself.

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The old lady is still alive!

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The old man died, and the old man came out!

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The old lady is still alive!

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I told you to sit in front of the Buddha's altar!

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The old lady isn't a ghost?

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, the old man came out, and said,

268
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to say something, but I can't.

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The old man?

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The old man said, I want to say something, but I can't.

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I understand the old man's feelings.

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The old man said, I want to say something, but I can't.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He's a pervert.

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're stupid!

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No, he's a pervert!

276
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He's a pervert?

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, he's a pervert!

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He said, I want to say something, but I can't.

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's why he came out.

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Are you forcing me?

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's normal.

282
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's a waterfall.

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There's a rock at the top of the waterfall.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What are you talking about?

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you look at the rock at the top of the waterfall,

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
there's a woman standing on the rock.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you look at the rock at the top of the waterfall,

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
there's a woman standing on the rock.

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What?

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If you look at the rock at the top of the waterfall,

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
there's a woman standing on the rock.

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're good.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're good?

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Are you listening to me?

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There's a woman standing on the rock at the top of the waterfall.

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

299
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's hard work.

300
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you do it, you'll do it.

301
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't fall and die!

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't fall and die on the rock.

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Say that you came out to the rock because you're a pervert.

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you forcing me?

305
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Say that you came out to the rock because you're a pervert.

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't believe that.

307
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Say that you came out to the rock because you're a pervert.

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What?

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What?

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't believe that.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You said that you were possessed.

312
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's the scariest thing.

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's the scariest thing.

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you know what happens if you're possessed by a white snake or a fox?

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's amazing.

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
When I was in high school, my classmate did this.

317
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
When the teacher was writing, he was sitting.

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He jumped.

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He jumped?

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He jumped.

321
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What was that?

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He jumped.

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He jumped.

324
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't think he was possessed by anything.

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He was the one who was always in the class.

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's not true.

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He was possessed by a white snake.

328
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
My classmate saw him while he was writing.

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He saw him?

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He saw him.

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He saw my classmate while he was writing.

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you talking about?

333
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're a pervert.

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's not true.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You said that.

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What?

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You just heard that.

338
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why are you talking about me?

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's right.

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He was possessed.

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's scary.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What do you mean?

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
For example, I think there are people who drive cars.

344
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There are dogs and cats next to you.

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're being pulled.

346
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're being pulled.

347
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They're passing by.

348
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
When I passed by, I thought, that's so sad.

349
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's an animal ghost.

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When I thought that's so sad, they came in.

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For example, a dog.

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes, yes, yes.

353
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
One of my friends.

354
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He was caught in a burning fire.

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I felt sorry for him.

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Didn't you hear that?

357
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He was running on the street.

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He was being dragged.

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I felt sorry for him, so I came in.

360
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Where were you running?

361
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was running.

362
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I was running.

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
On a rainy day.

364
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I saw a burning image.

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I felt sorry for him.

366
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I went down and put a blanket on him.

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I went in.

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
After that, I talked to him.

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He was crying.

370
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
My relative.

371
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He was caught by a mackerel.

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He was running in the rain.

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I saw a mackerel.

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I saw a mackerel.

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The mackerel closed its eyes quietly.

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I went down and put a blanket on him.

377
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The mackerel was running.

378
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I took off my pants.

379
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The mackerel was smelly.

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He was the only one who was laughing.

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I said, let's go to the beach.

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He said, go home.

383
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes, yes.

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I went to the beach.

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was scolded by a mackerel.

386
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's go.

387
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's go.

388
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a sound.

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a sound.

390
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's a sound that I rarely hear.

391
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's a sound that I rarely hear.

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you very much.

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That girl is a good girl.

394
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, she is an assistant in the program.

395
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm still recruiting her.

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The staff asked me if I had a TV show.

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
By the way, I'm glad I'm not angry.

398
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You are a bad person.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm glad I'm not angry.

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm not angry.

402
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know because I'm wearing makeup.

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But when I take off my makeup, my face is red.

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't say such a thing.

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is the fifth time.

406
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll give you the nose hair product.

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Please take a look at it.

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll use it later.

409
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll use it later.

410
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll use it later.

411
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm not good at this.

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm not good at this.

413
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not good at this.

414
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is a person.

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This is a person.

416
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is a person.

417
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Kurimoto Maki-chan.

418
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm still in the second floor.

419
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm having fun with it.

420
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm still in the second floor, so it's okay.

421
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Will you continue to do manzai?

422
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Don't you have any more material?

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That is the place of the downtown.

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I believe that even after 20 or 30 times, I will continue to do manzai.

425
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Please do your best!

426
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's the story like this.

427
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What do you think about this?

428
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
20 or 30 times, he will continue to do material.

429
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hmm...

430
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What do you think?

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hmm...

432
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank you very much.

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Even if it's a joke, in the end it's all up to me.

434
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Right?

436
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm the only one who can think of a joke.

437
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And then...

438
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You recruited an assistant, right?

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And then, there's this thing where they tell you to stop doing things like this.

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This person told me to put in a photo.

441
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yoshida-san.

442
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yoshida Satomi-san.

443
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Please send me another one.

444
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He sent me a photo like this.

445
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Ouch!

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And this is me, right?

447
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Even if you hate me, you won't understand.

448
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Umm...

449
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If you don't think about it.

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're giving me a lot of energy.

451
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's right, but...

452
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This kind of thing...

453
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Even if you tell me this is a photo of the culprit, I can't solve it.

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Have you ever been angry?

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I haven't been angry recently.

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm having a lot of fun every day.

457
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why is that?

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Why?

459
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The place has changed.

460
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can't solve it that easily.

461
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can solve it.

462
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm also from Tokyo.

463
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're annoying.

464
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm going back to Osaka tomorrow.

465
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't have the feeling of going back to Osaka.

466
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm going to Kansai.

467
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The intonation is different.

468
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

469
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You're going to Kansai?

470
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm going to Kansai.

471
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There were a lot of letters like that.

472
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are some difficult words in Osaka dialect.

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I asked you how about Osaka dialect.

474
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

475
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
In my makeup shop,

476
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There's no dip.

477
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There's a new product.

478
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
New.

479
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's a new product.

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I took it and said,

481
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This is a plate.

482
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's a plate.

483
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Can I use it?

484
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What?

485
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know what a plate is.

486
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If you say plate, it's like a sanitary product.

487
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's not it.

488
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is a plate.

489
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is different from the intonation.

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This is a plate.

491
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What I'm saying is a plate.

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The sanitary products are amazing these days.

493
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What are you talking about?

494
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It has nothing to do with you.

495
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The absorbency is amazing.

496
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's nothing.

497
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
My mother

498
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
When I used the absorbency,

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It went up.

500
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You're lying.

501
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The absorbency is amazing.

502
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know,

503
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
There's something on the eyes.

504
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What do you call that?

505
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Monomorai?

506
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Monomorai.

507
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's not it.

508
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
In Osaka, it's called monomorai.

509
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It doesn't make sense.

510
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
In Osaka, it's called

511
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Mebatsuko.

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't laugh.

513
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't make fun of me.

514
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Mebatsuko.

515
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Everyone laughs when I say this.

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Everyone laughs when I say this.

517
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When I'm sleeping, I laugh like this.

518
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Mebatsuko.

519
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What's wrong with you?

520
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm so angry.

521
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's right.

522
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's what it is.

523
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
For example, people who are watching

524
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is what it looks like in Osaka.

525
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What do you mean by this?

526
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's what it is.

527
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So maybe

528
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's do it once.

529
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's do it.

530
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This is what it looks like.

531
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll use it like this.

532
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'd like to do it again.

533
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You studied today, didn't you?

534
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What do you call monomorai?

535
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Mebatsuko.

536
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's right.

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You've learned one thing.

538
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Mebatsuko.

539
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mebatsuko.

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Here you go.

541
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Mebatsuko.

542
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Here you go.

543
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So,

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You've learned one thing about Osaka.

545
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's all for today. Goodbye.

546
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
No.

547
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's over.

548
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's over.

549
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How was it?

550
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, it was good.

551
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There were a lot of people who laughed.

552
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So,

553
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There were a lot of people from the city hall.

554
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't usually have much fun.

555
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm happy.

556
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's what it looks like.

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And

558
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I've been checking a lot.

559
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, before the show?

560
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah.

561
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I picked up about four people.

562
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You picked up about four people.

563
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That was good.

564
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Four people.

565
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's right.

566
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's right.

567
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's right.

568
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If it were those four people,

569
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'd give them about 50,000 yen.

570
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's where I usually spend money.

571
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm thinking about going somewhere next time.

572
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's right.

573
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's right.

574
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We're all together.

575
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
If I go somewhere else,

576
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I feel a sense of freedom.

577
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's right.

578
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Well, it doesn't matter.

579
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It doesn't matter.

580
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It doesn't matter.

581
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It doesn't matter.

582
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well,

583
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's decided.

584
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Of course, that's right.

585
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What?

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's right.

587
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's right.

588
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's right.

589
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's right.

590
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, that's it.

591
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well,

592
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
There were a lot of people.

593
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There were a lot of people.

594
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Osaka-men's way of speaking.

595
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There were a lot of things.

596
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's right.

597
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's right.

598
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's right.

599
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's right.

600
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Goodbye.

601
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Goodbye.
