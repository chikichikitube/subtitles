1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From now on, we will begin the 4th trial of Heipou Fusuppera.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All members of the court, please enter the courtroom.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All members of the court, please enter the courtroom.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You don't have to be so angry.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're in a neutral position.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The next defendant, Heipou, please enter the courtroom.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The defendant, Heipou.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Although he is a child abuser, he was accused of lying, being irresponsible, and cheating.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He was accused of many crimes, and he was sentenced to 3 years in prison.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
However, he is still accused of lying, and he is causing a lot of trouble to the people.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Therefore, the 4th trial of Heipou Fusuppera is about to begin.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm Ryo.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
To be honest, I'm surprised to hear this.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Prosecutor Hamada, please present the evidence.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just like the other trials, we have a list of Heipou's crimes.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Everyone, please take a look at this.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is when he went golfing as a child abuser.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Heipou men!

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Nice shot!

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nice shot, Heipou! You're doing great today!

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Right?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Fresh Heipou!

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, hey, hey, Heipou!

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Golfing is fun, isn't it?

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Heipou was in a great mood, and he finished the half.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm hungry.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's eat.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I'm going to the bathroom, so please go ahead.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A few minutes later, Heipou comes back from the bathroom.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I feel so much better. Did you all order?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, only Heipou left.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What did you all order?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I ordered curry rice.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I ordered tonkatsu.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I ordered a sandwich.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And then...

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You guys are so stupid!

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Look at that!

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's Tororo soba!

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tororo soba!

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right. This place is famous for Tororo soba.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You guys are so stupid not to eat Tororo soba here.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If you want to be the best man, you have to eat the best food.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Excuse me!

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Can I have a Tororo soba, please?

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A few minutes later...

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's eat!

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, but this curry is really good.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, no. My Tororo soba is the best. It's really good.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After a satisfying meal...

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you for the meal.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, I ate. I ate.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now the second half is perfect.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Then let's go to the second half.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And then...

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey, Heipou, what's this?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You left something.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, yes, yes.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is Tororo soba.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, I forgot to put Tororo soba in it.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Heipou didn't put Tororo soba in Tororo soba.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He ate normal soba.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Heipou's second half was a mess.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Here's your obi.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That soba is dangerous.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Judge, I'd like you to testify in this case.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Everyone, of course you know.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, I've seen it.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm Prosecutor Suga.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes, I know.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm a witness.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's already a fact?

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know, you can easily eat curry.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I wasn't that hungry.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So the moment I ate curry, I was really hungry.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I was told, you shouldn't have done that as a director.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's what I was told.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can't even eat one thing.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You have to eat the best of the best.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's what being a director is all about.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I see.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So that's what happened.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So he ordered Tororo soba?

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So Tororo is the best?

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What does Tororo mean?

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But you can eat the best of the best, right?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You have to eat the best of the best.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know you can eat the best of the best.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can I eat it?

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The soba was really good.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I heard it was the best.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If it was good, that's enough.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So you put the soba in the soup and ate it?

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Was there Tororo next to it?

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There was.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I forgot.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You didn't forget, did you?

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Which way do you want to go?

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Your character setting is wrong.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Which way do you want to go?

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is one of the many taxi accidents that happened to Heipo.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Taxi! Taxi!

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Here we go!

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Go ahead!

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hi, I'm Heipo from the world.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Driver, can you take me to Heipo?

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry, but I'm a newbie and I don't know much about roads.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It doesn't matter.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I know all the roads in Tokyo.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And then the taxi left in that car.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Listen to me.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's wrong?

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The other day, I got hit by a car.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That was amazing.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Excuse me, can I go straight on this road?

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, go straight.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What's wrong, Saito?

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I got in the way, so I'll tell you from the beginning.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The other day, I got hit by a car.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That was amazing.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Excuse me, can I go straight on this road?

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, go straight.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What happened, Saito?

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm really sorry.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll say it again.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The other day, I got hit by a car.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
After that...

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry, sir.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey, you're so noisy.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you really a pro?

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've asked you so many times.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How can you eat like that?

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It doesn't matter.

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can go on your own.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm a newbie driver.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A newbie driver who's completely lost it.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In the end, he was forced to pay for it.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Saito, help me!

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll tell you the truth about this incident.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know you.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm Nakamura.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is the VTR.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
When you enter a road that's different from usual,

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you'll be like,

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't want to pay for it.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you're a pro, you have to work as a pro.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have to pay at least once every three times.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That much?

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's amazing.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And...

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Isn't that a little help?

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, no, no.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I've already paid for it.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, it's hard.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can I go to the bathroom right now?

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's still more.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're just getting in the way of the conversation.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why are you so angry?

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm just talking to you.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How much of the conversation is true?

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Of course it's true.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When I was drinking,

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
a woman suddenly appeared.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She asked me if I wanted to drink with her.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There's a lot.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There's a lot?

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There's a lot.

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How often do you drink a year?

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
At least once a month.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's true.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a lie.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a lie.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's true.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He's telling the truth.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's telling the truth.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't lie to me.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't lie to me.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You can't lie like that.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The woman called me later.

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
To be honest,

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I've had a good relationship with her.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Every now and then.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't lie to me.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't lie to me.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When the director gets angry,

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm living in a hotel right now.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're living in a hotel?

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why?

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's why I'm living there.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's right.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why?

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When the director gets angry,

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm living in a hotel right now.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a lie.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I live in a hotel.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's why I'm living in a hotel.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Who is it?

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is the story of the old time.

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Nice to meet you.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Nice to meet you.

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Excuse me.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There's one more person, Heipou-san, the kid's servant, who's late.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Apparently, he's on his way here now, but he'll be here in a little while.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Eh? Could it be that Heipou-san?

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's right.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Amazing! Heipou-san's here!

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Ah! I'm late again!

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Heipou appears late.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sorry for the wait.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He's really good at this kind of program.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's for sure.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's Heipou!

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, yes, yes. Everyone, isn't she really cute?

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She's the perfect woman for me.

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, for now, cheers!

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Cheers!

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Heipou-san is really busy with work, isn't he?

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, yes. That's right.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm really busy.

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Thanks to you, I have a lot of money.

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wow, amazing! How wonderful!

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What are you riding in your car?

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes, yes. Of course, it's a red Porsche.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yah! I want to ride it!

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's okay.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Apparently, she's a stewardess who's known for her money, and she's the perfect woman for Heipou.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, she's popular today, too.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Heipou is so into her sexy attacks.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Heipou-san is so cool. I want a Vuitton bag.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's cheap. I can buy one or two Vuitton bags at any price.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Heipou-san, I love you!

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Wow!

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Heipou, who's so popular that he's become the center of attention, later made a date with her.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And a few days later, Heipou called to confirm the date.

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hello? Hello, this is Heipou from the world.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, hello, Heipou-san. I've been waiting for you.

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Tomorrow, let's meet at 6 o'clock and go buy a Vuitton bag.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Of course, after that, please keep it open.

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Huh? Yes?

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Tomorrow, I'm staying at the usual public hotel.

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What? I'm sorry.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Tomorrow, my parents are coming and I'm going to stay at home, so I only have two hours to shop.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are you talking about? Are you lying to me?

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I promised to buy a Vuitton bag, but don't you know that it's an adult promise?

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to buy something worth it, so I can't do it without merit.

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll make it clear, but I won't buy it unless it's a bet.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't make it clear.

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
After that, he never met her again.

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The bet is already decided, right?

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I see.

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Now, let's confirm this.

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I know.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You know, right?

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Now, Suimoto.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
By the way, why are you guys making such a concoction?

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
First of all, let me hear that.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Are you making a concoction?

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I will make a concoction.

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I will definitely make a concoction.

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That means you didn't do it?

272
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn't do it.

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to buy it for you anyway, so it's the same if it's a bet, right?

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You can go buy it after you do it.

275
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are there so many?

276
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm going to buy it for you.

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to give you a present and put it in the bed.

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't say that.

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Thank you.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Other than this, is there anything else?

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I used to lie a lot when I was in a motel.

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I used to lie a lot when I was in a motel.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like a Porsche?

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I used to lie a lot when I was in a motel.

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why are you making a concoction?

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have enough money to buy it, so it's the same if it's a bet, right?

288
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No, it's not.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a concoction.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, it's not.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's the same.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I have enough money to buy it, so it's the same if it's a bet, right?

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I used to go to a musical party.

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
At that time, a thief came into my house.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
A thief came into your house?

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A thief came into my house.

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There's a VTR.

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you watch it, you'll understand.

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's watch it.

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I really want to go to a wedding.

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Recently, it's a personal matter.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What are you talking about?

304
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There's something unhappy going on.

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What is it?

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Actually, I haven't told anyone recently.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Two or three days ago, I was in my apartment.

308
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Really?

309
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Really?

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Luckily, I put my passbook in the back.

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But I couldn't get it.

314
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It was okay, but the glass was broken.

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll tell you what I found out later.

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Actually, there was no thief in the police officer's room.

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What?

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What do you mean?

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You said that just now.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's right.

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He said it was in his room.

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He said it was broken.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He said it was broken.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So, both of them entered my next room.

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But it's natural that they entered it mentally.

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's natural that they entered it mentally.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's the meaning of this?

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What's the meaning of this?

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What's the meaning of this?

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's the meaning of this?

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What's the meaning of this?

333
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is the incident that happened at the end of last year when Heipo was in charge of the general production.

334
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
On that day, an emergency meeting was held, and the staff suddenly called Heipo.

335
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Mr. Saito, actually, I have an emergency meeting tonight.

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What?

337
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Good evening.

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Actually, I'm going to give a speech at the debate show today.

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Mr. Saito, please.

340
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The staff asked him to attend the meeting.

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But Heipo...

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I only have one body.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Please hold the meeting first.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
When the meeting is over, I'll go check it out.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Heipo refused to attend the meeting and hung up on the phone.

346
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And that night...

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's hot pot.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Heipo was in a good mood before his favorite hot pot.

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Mr. Atsushi and Mr. Ryo, please.

350
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Mr. Heipo, thank you for the past year.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What are you talking about?

352
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Aren't you in a debate show with me?

353
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's have fun today.

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
On the other hand, the meeting was full of ideas.

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And two hours later...

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The staff still had no idea.

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's almost time for Mr. Saito's speech.

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, let's call him.

359
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The staff contacted an acquaintance to catch Heipo.

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Hello?

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm looking for Mr. Saito right now.

362
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Mr. Saito? He went to a mahjong match with Ryo.

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Mahjong?

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,000
After the party, Heipo went to a mahjong match with Ryo.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Ryo!

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm Ryo from London Bulls.

367
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
To be honest, I'm surprised to hear that.

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I didn't know it was going to be like that.

369
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Ryo didn't know.

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But I remember it clearly.

372
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I want to tell you the truth.

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There was a year-end party.

374
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
At the end, Heipo invited me to a mahjong match.

375
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The party ended early.

376
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So I asked him if he had work to do.

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He said he was fine.

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I really remember that.

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I went to a mahjong match.

380
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I won by myself.

381
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It rained a few times on the way.

382
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I asked him if he had work to do.

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He said he was fine.

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Please take care of him.

385
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The party ended early.

386
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Why don't you go to the meeting?

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I wanted to play mahjong.

388
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What?

389
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I wanted to play mahjong.

390
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I wanted to play mahjong.

391
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
His face when he said it was true made me angry.

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It made me angry.

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We will announce the verdict.

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It is hard to believe that Heipo is a liar.

395
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He has caused a lot of trouble to many people.

396
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There is no room for excuses.

397
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The verdict will be the punishment of a horror movie.

398
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He will never appear in front of us again.

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The verdict will be the punishment of a horror movie.

400
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Why are you so cool?

402
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm scared.

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is scary.

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's scary.

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There are a lot of scary scenes.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is this a shooting room?

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Alone.

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's scary.

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm scared.

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

412
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

413
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

414
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The child doesn't understand this.

415
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Please let me go.

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

417
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

418
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

419
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What is it?

420
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm scared.

421
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't want to take it out!

422
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't want to take it out!

423
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm surprised!

424
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm scared!

425
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Please do it!

426
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't want to take it out!

427
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
He's 5 years old.

428
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Everyone else is going to see it.

429
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What is it?

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can't stand it.

431
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I can't stand it.

432
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't want to take it out!

433
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm scared!

434
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't want to take it out!

435
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's over.

436
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Turn on the lights.

437
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't want to take it out!

438
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Please do it!

439
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Please do it!

440
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't want to take it out!

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What do you think, Yamaguchi-san?

442
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know how to say it.

443
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think it's a punishment.

444
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think it's the same as the viewers.

445
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
When I see that punishment, I get angry.

446
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You want to do it more, right?

447
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
More!

448
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please do it!

449
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Please do it!
