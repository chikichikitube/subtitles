1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
At the foot of Mt. Fuji, there is a lake full of water called Kawaguchiko.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This lake is also famous for being a place where people gather for fishing.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But deep in the lake, there is a legend that there is an imaginary giant fish that has defeated many fishermen in the Korean War.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In Downtown, he challenges the imaginary black bus that travels around the world.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is it?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I heard that Mr. Ito is fishing here.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When I came to the program before, I said,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you don't have a hobby, how about fishing?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You said that, didn't you?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's right.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You said that, didn't you?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I didn't think so.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You said that, didn't you?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Mr. Ito said,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then let's do it.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you serious?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm serious.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I came at 6 o'clock this morning.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's real.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, it's real.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a real Itoi.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What are you doing?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Itoi Shigesato, a man who is a man and a fish.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He is a man who is shown to be a black bus fisherman who demands high strategicity.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry I'm early in the morning.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, no, no.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry I'm so early in the morning.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's Mr. Itoi.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not early at all.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry I'm so early.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Can you fish here?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I can.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you see what I just caught?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can see it.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Can I brag about it?

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, go ahead.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wow.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's mine.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's mine.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's a really big one, isn't it?

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just now.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just now?

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Just now, just now.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I dropped it on purpose.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's fresh.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't hate it that much.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I have it this time.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't hate it that much.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, no, no.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't hate it.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You don't hate it?

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't hate it.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's lure fishing.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's lure fishing.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're going to fish for bass using lure.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can I?

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, yes, yes.

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll put this between my middle finger and ring finger.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Between your middle finger and ring finger?

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here, here, here, here.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, like this?

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a different one.

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You don't even know your middle finger and ring finger.

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You don't even know.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no, no, no.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right.

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can I?

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wow.

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's the worst.

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't think you're a bad person.

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't think you're a bad person.

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The clock is 12 o'clock at the top, right?

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Think that you have a clock.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do it until 2 o'clock and talk at 10 o'clock.

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This index finger.

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's going to fly away.

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, I'll do it badly.

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can I?

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do it until 2 o'clock and talk at 10 o'clock.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do it until 2 o'clock and talk at 10 o'clock?

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, it's not bad.

90
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's not bad.

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do it until 2 o'clock and talk at 10 o'clock.

92
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm doing it until 4 o'clock right now.

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, until 4 o'clock.

94
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I was talking at 9 o'clock.

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, really?

96
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh.

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What?

98
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was surprised.

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you.

100
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's dangerous.

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's dangerous.

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's dangerous.

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's dangerous.

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, no, no.

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was talking from 2 o'clock to 10 o'clock.

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
8 seconds, 8 seconds.

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's dangerous.

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's dangerous.

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's dangerous.

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At last, the battle between downtown, Itoishigesato,

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and the black bus, a mysterious lake, is about to begin.

112
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Two times a week, itoishi, who goes to Kawaguchiko, gets to the point of the black bus.

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Ito-san is coming. It's coming. Oh, it's coming. It's coming. It's coming.

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It was a big one. It's coming. It's coming.

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is it? It's coming. It's coming.

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming.

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But if it comes, don't be impatient. I know.

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can we drive with the electric motor after the shootout?

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm scared.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can do it. It can do it.

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Does this have something like a second engine?

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is what I'm stepping on with my feet. This is called an electric motor.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you have a driver's license you can ride with them

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That would be fun

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's coming

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's coming

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's coming

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's coming

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That was big

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What a waste

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You hit yourself

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What a waste

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That was big

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That was close

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's coming

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's coming

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't panic

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's coming

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
His face is panicking

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
His face is panicking

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
His face is panicking

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He did it

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wait

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Put your thumb in here

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm scared

147
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is fine

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm scared

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's fine

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How do you get the needle?

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Put it a bit forward

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's an idiot

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's an idiot

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why did you get caught by me?

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Look at his eyes

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's coming

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why did you get caught?

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's strange

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's coming

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I saw it was 28cm

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a good size

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mine is better

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Mine is better

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Mine is better

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's coming

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm happy

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's coming

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's small

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why did you put it in the net?

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I forgot

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I quit

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm going to be a gill

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm going to be a gill

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's sad

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's sad

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's the worst when you say it

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's the worst when you say it

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's coming

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a fish

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I couldn't eat it

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I knew it

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I didn't have anything

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's change the worm

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We need one person to do the comedy

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We need one person to do the comedy

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
From here

190
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You idiot

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's not it

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Did you get caught?

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Put the rope

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The time is tight

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The time is tight

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The time is tight

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's coming

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's coming

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's coming

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's coming

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's coming

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's coming

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's big

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's big

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What is this?

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's coming

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's coming

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's big

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's huge!

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You have to catch it!

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't let it escape!

215
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Raise the rod!

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is huge!

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What is this?

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is huge!

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's hot!

220
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's huge!

221
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
46cm?

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
47cm?

223
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's amazing!

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's the biggest I've ever caught.

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I caught it in the U.S.

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is that so?

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is not a bad thing.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is a good size.

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's coming!

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's huge!

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it's not as big as the one before.

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not as big as the one before.

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's small.

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can catch anything!

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This one is smaller.

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hold it like this.

238
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The bottom is good.

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We caught two fish.

240
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We caught two fish.

241
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We caught two fish.

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We caught two fish.

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We caught two fish.

244
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We caught two fish.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't want to complain.

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm going to put salad on it.

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What is this?

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's wrinkled.

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's wrinkled.

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's huge!

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's huge!

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's huge!

253
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can I wind it?

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's wrinkled.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Did I hold it?

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll wind it.

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's huge!

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Stop it!

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stop it!

260
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're not interested, are you?

261
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're not interested, are you?

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're not interested, are you?

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I thought I'd stop fishing.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's coming.

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's coming.

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's big.

268
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't be impatient.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't be impatient.

270
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I didn't see it.

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's so big that I don't want to fish.

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why?

273
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why?

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's so big that I don't want to fish.

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's so big that I don't want to fish.

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What should we do now?

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
My hand stinks.

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
My hand stinks.

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was wrinkled in the opening.

280
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It stinks.

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What is this?

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It stinks.

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's a different smell.

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a different smell.

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Especially around here.

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I came back from the back.

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It still stinks.

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It still stinks.

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It stinks even in the car.

290
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It stinks even in the car.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can smell the cigarette.

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're wrong.

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Who is it?

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Who is it?

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a round latte!

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Did you start to like fishing?

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, you know, it's a show like that.

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They do everything for us.

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You have to get the right people.

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If you ask me if I want to go fishing...

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think that...

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What?

304
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't like that kind of thing.

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you mean?

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You have to get the right people and give them back.

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, yes.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know if it's a kind license or something.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Everyone has that.

310
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think that's no good.

311
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can't give them back.

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You...

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You've been giving them back to a few people like this.

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, well, well, well.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't help it because you told me.

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The reason why you can't give them back is...

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If you give them back, he'll tell everyone, right?

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

319
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Be careful.

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Whoa!

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He gave them back!

322
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Whoa!

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Right?

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think that's true.

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you serious?

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you serious?

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's what he'll say.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Did you just give them back?

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No way.

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No way.

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you serious?

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm serious.

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You can't give them back.

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was swimming, so I was hungry.

335
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So he went in fast?

336
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He went in fast, but he got caught.

337
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You're there, you know that.

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I told you to give them back.

339
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And this is serious.

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The police are coming, we need to be careful, we need to be careful.

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We'll learn from it slowly.

342
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You should never give them back.

343
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I caught them myself, so I'm going to catch them myself.

344
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not good.

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's the same as rag-a-bye.

346
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No.

347
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He said, if we caught them ourselves, we should catch them ourselves.

348
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,500
What?

349
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
You went fishing, didn't you?

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, I went fishing

351
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ahhhh!

352
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You were like this, you put your hand in your mouth and grabbed it

353
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Ah, please do it already!

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's disgusting to touch things like that

355
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It can't be helped, at the end

356
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
While you're saying that, you should wear a shirt like this

357
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Today, it just so happened that I went fishing

358
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It just so happened that I went fishing

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It just so happened that I went fishing

360
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're saying things that you don't understand

361
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, it's fine

362
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you know that?

363
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The new manager

364
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Eh? That's Akutagawa, right?

365
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Akutagawa?

366
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He seems to be having quite a crash here

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Quite a crash?

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He seems to be having quite a crash

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Right now, he's still in Higashino, right?

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
When I asked him, he laughed

372
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Even now

373
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He said, I'll make curry for lunch today

374
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I said, yes, understood

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And when he came to the dressing room

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He left a curry roux

377
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're laughing, aren't you?

378
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, I'm not! I'm serious!

379
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He said, I'll make curry for lunch

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He left a curry roux

381
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He left a box of curry roux

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He said, I don't know what you're talking about

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What is this?

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm so angry

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I said, oh, it's curry!

386
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He said, this is it

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's hot, it's hot

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I said, what is this? It's this Hyorokudama

389
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I got angry

390
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You said it yourself?

391
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I said, what is this Hyorokudama?

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I said, I don't understand

393
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I called my girlfriend

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was told by Hamada-san that it's Hyorokudama

395
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Can you look it up in the dictionary?

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's written here

397
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Isn't this terrible?

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I shouldn't have asked my girlfriend

399
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Why are you talking like that?

400
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm talking like this

401
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's annoying, isn't it?

402
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You've been going to university for 4 years

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But you're helping a guy who went to a prison

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Right?

405
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A guy who was called by his number

406
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I wasn't called

407
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Number 1526

408
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Who? Me?

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The guy who said, come on!

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Come on!

411
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's funny that you didn't get called

412
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's right

413
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm not feeling well today

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Why?

415
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't know the reason

416
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Do you have the courage?

417
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't have the courage

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Why is that?

419
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I feel like I've done it 3 times

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't help it

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But recently I've been doing it 1000 times

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You did it everyday before

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I did it everyday

424
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Did you feel good?

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, I felt good

426
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's good

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Thank you

428
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you

429
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's the second episode of Yuichi Jungle

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Why?

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
My back hurts so much

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Your back hurts, your ears hurt, your stomach hurts, what else makes you feel sick?

433
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's because of my appearance

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's because of your appearance

435
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What else?

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think I'm starting to feel sick

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Is that so?

438
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
When I go home, I take off my socks

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The shape of my socks is hard to cut

440
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's because you're wearing tight socks

441
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's hard to cut after 5 minutes

442
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm happy that you said that

443
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
When I go home, I take off my socks because it's hot

444
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm always watching TV like this

445
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why are you bored at home?

446
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I watch TV and go home

447
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I watch it all the time and I still feel sick

448
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm about to cry

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm fine

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Really?

451
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But...

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Wait, hey!

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Stand up

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's like that

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It happens

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If you get a tattoo next time, what will it be?

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you mean next time?

458
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I won't get a tattoo next time

459
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's fine

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I won't get a tattoo next time

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's fine if you don't get a tattoo

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I won't get a tattoo

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's fine if you don't get a tattoo

464
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you want to get a tattoo?

465
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't want to get a tattoo, but I already got one

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You already got one?

467
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But it doesn't mean anything if everyone gets a tattoo

468
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Why?

469
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like a rose

470
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It doesn't mean anything

471
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If I get a tattoo, it's more meaningful

472
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's useful

473
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Wait, it's a tattoo, so it's not useful

474
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No, so...

475
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll make this a calendar

476
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What do you mean?

477
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
When will it be a calendar?

478
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How long will it be a calendar?

479
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Next month, next month

480
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Even if it ends like that, I won't get a tattoo

481
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What are you doing?

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's more meaningful

483
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Or you can write your name here

484
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's not pants

485
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Let's change it to Sambi Matsumoto

486
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're not Sambi

487
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why did you try to get a tattoo again?

488
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No

489
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I didn't

490
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You have a lot of admiration for Yakuzas

491
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's the thing I hate the most

492
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You really like Yakuzas

493
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why?

494
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You have a live photo of Yakuzas

495
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Why is the end of the toilet paper in a triangle?

496
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But that's a woman's

497
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Men don't have it

498
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's a woman's hatred

499
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
A different woman came

500
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's a woman's hatred

501
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Long hair falls off

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's normal

503
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Long hair doesn't fall off

504
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
While I was going to the toilet, she was peeing

505
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I know what you're up to

506
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And she was rolling around

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I know

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I thought I'd hold her down

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And open it

510
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And then

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I dropped the napkin's seal

512
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I dropped it

513
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You should have noticed and done it

514
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I did the earrings

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I did it on purpose

516
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I did it on purpose

517
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
When I went to the bathroom

518
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I said, wait a minute

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I did it

520
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I did it

521
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I thought I'd forget about it

522
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And then

523
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I said, wait a minute

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I didn't feel it at all

525
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And then

526
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's business

527
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I said, I'm glad you did it

528
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And then

529
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And then

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I said, I forgot

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't say it with the same tone

532
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's your tone

533
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I said, wait a minute

534
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It was so hot

535
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's not like that

536
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's summer

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Really?

538
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What season do you like?

539
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I like winter

540
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I always ask you

541
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What are you doing?

542
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And you always say

543
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What are you doing?

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What are you doing?

545
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What is this?

546
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What is this?

547
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What is this?

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You say something ambiguous

549
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If I can catch you

550
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll catch you

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
With high heels

552
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Running on the beach

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't know

554
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No one will catch you

555
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You try to act like a little devil

556
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's wrong with your head?

557
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If it's winter, say it

558
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
If it's summer, say it

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You're acting like a little devil

560
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Say it

561
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If it's summer, say it

562
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Don't interrupt me

563
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Wait a minute

564
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't talk too much
