1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're the best, Jojo.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Jojo is the best.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He's the best.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He's the best.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What about you, Masaki?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's the best.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Are you going to get married?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right away?

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're late.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What's wrong?

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Are you feeling down?

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you feeling down because you're too happy?

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well...

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to get married tomorrow.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Congratulations.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're so excited.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Last week, Yamazaki was able to get married without feeling embarrassed.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But something is wrong.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There's something that's bothering me.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Marriage blue, right?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not marriage blue.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have a relationship with her.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But as a man, I thought I had to make an end to it.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But you're already married.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To be honest, it's important.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a relationship.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is a relationship.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You should do it yourself.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's not like that.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not like that.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When you're going to get married, you have to make an end to it.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There are people who are dating other than Aya.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't like it either.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's the worst.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you have a girlfriend now?

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's this?

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a two-shot photo.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I know.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is the composition of the photo.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is this a two-shot?

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is a two-shot when I went to Izu.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The back doesn't look like Izu at all.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There's nothing wrong with the back.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a photo.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is when I skydived.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's nothing wrong with the back.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know if I'm going to stay with Yuka forever or if I'm going to break up with her and go to my wife.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you still dating?

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm still dating.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Really?

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're not going to tell your girlfriend.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have to return the stuff.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What do you mean?

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I forgot about it when I went to stay with her.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You went to stay with her?

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You went to stay with her?

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I went to stay with her.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I thought you were taking pictures.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was really dangerous. I was really worried.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't want Matsumoto-san to die.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why?

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a very jelousy drug, right?

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you mean by jelousy drug?

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a drug that you take twice.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I forgot about this.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I left this at home.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have to return this.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can I go now?

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can go.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Everyone, please go.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We can't do anything.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know if we can do anything.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to turn white and go to Aya's place.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're going to go?

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When he's with me, he's always...

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You?

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He calls me Yu.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's always there.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's always there.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He's really lonely.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's always there.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's married.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's really lonely.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's totally different.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He's not lonely.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's busier than Yamasaki.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's really busy.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can't do anything.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Good morning.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yu, good morning.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a normal morning.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I think you already know.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm laughing.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to get married.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I know.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's bad for Yu, but...

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's break up.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I've become a bad person.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not just Yu.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What is Yu?

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yu is about you.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't call me like that.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't call me Yu.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't call me Yu.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
When we're together, you call me Yu.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When we're together, you call me Yu.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We've never called each other Yu.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We've never called each other Yu.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't say stupid things.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are you talking about?

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm going to get scolded.

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is my profile picture.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We went to Izu together.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We didn't go to Izu.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We didn't go to Izu.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We didn't go to Izu.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That was funny.

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We didn't go to Izu.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We didn't go to Izu.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Do you remember this?

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What is this?

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you remember this?

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is a composition.

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's not a composition.

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know what a composition is.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why do you have to get scolded?

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't want to get scolded.

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't want to get scolded.

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you talking about?

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't want to get scolded.

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I forgot.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What?

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't wear it recently.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're a fool.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What is this?

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why do you bring it like this?

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't touch it.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll buy you this.

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't need it.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not mine.

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I remember this.

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you remember?

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When I was on the same show with Shimura.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You were on the same show.

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You disappeared before I knew it.

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You disappeared.

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I was so nervous.

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's why I tried not to talk in front of Shimura.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But in September...

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What?

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a funny song.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's a funny song.

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a funny song.

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's a good song.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a good song.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What is it?

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hit me.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you doing?

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hit me.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why?

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Take my feelings for you.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Say goodbye to me.

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't have feelings for you.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you have feelings for me?

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know why.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you have feelings for me?

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know why you called me.

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Forget that you like me.

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It hurts.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go home.

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Take this with you.

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't need it.

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He is...

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He looks happy.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
As expected.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He was smiling today.

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I didn't see it until now.

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was hard.

190
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
To be honest, it was hard.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But it's okay.

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If it's not like that,

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't be happy with you two.

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Shall we go next?

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Not yet?

197
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's okay.

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
One time is enough.

199
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No.

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
One time is not enough.

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not that kind of problem.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What?

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You were holding hands so much.

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
From the other side,

205
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was in a big trouble.

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you come after that,

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
it will be difficult.

208
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Who is this person?

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is this person Kaguya?

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't know that.

212
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Really?

213
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are getting along with your family.

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Really?

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Shion is getting along with his family.

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who is this person?

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't know.

218
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Who is Shion?

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It doesn't matter.

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Shion is...

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't say things like that.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Is that so?

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No.

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll say it.

225
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
His approach was great.

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I forgot to say Yoh.

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Really?

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is the one that Kaguya was in.

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Really?

230
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I didn't know that.

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My approach was great.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You didn't like it that much.

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't like it that much.

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I just thought it smelled good.

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I usually...

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you still have it?

237
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This one.

238
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I have this one.

239
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a lotion.

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I like it.

241
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You have a lot.

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I only use it once.

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You only use it once?

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I use it a lot.

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I use it a lot.

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I use it a lot.

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I use it a lot.

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I use it a lot.

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I use it a lot.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll return all of this.

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll take it.

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll take it.

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll take it.

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He has two.

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He has two.

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have two.

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have two.

258
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have two.

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I have two.

260
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're scared, right?

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're scared, right?

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're scared, right?

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's strange.

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hi.

265
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's been a while.

266
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How are you?

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's wrong?

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There's nothing wrong.

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think you know.

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm getting married.

271
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Congratulations.

272
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not congratulations.

273
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you still like me?

274
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Me?

275
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes.

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm not married yet.

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But if you were in front of me...

278
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're crying.

279
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You said you broke up with me.

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What?

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You asked me to go out with you.

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Who?

283
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll return this.

284
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This.

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You'll make a fool of me.

287
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're laughing.

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll take a picture like a family.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't think you'll be able to meet someone who's like me.

290
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My children are cute, right?

291
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's cute, but I know you'll put your heart into me.

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know that.

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know.

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you talking about?

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's it.

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This.

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What is this?

298
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When Kai attacks me, he always wears this.

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Am I wearing this?

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is also Kai's.

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What is this?

302
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This is a skirt.

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I used it with you.

304
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's not true.

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I made it muddy here.

306
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's not true.

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Absolutely not.

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's not true.

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Stand up.

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes.

311
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're strong.

312
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It looks like you still have a scar.

313
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Me?

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Where am I?

315
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hit me.

316
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why do I have to hit you?

317
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can't forget about me.

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to hit you, but you're noisy.

319
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It hurts.

320
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I love you.

321
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I love you.

322
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm angry.

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I forgot something.

324
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm angry.

325
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why is it Hamada?

326
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why is it Hamada among the four of us?

327
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's over.

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's over.

329
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's go to the west.

330
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's go.

331
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's go to the west.

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What is it?

333
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You broke up with the girl you loved.

334
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't feel that way.

335
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you still there?

336
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes.

337
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you still there?

338
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going.

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm still there.

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Are you serious?

341
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's over.

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't get tired of it.

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You've never been on this show before.

344
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm tired.

345
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What are you talking about?

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It doesn't matter.

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's time for me to be a man of my own age.

348
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well.

349
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The next time.

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was a long time.

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's Zaki's turn.

352
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Where did you go?

353
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is Italy.

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Italy?

355
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No.

356
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It doesn't suit you at all.

357
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It was cold.

358
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's big.

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's big.

360
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To be honest.

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I went to see the ballet.

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Really?

363
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I thought it was cute.

364
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was attractive.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's scary.

366
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're not going to give it back?

367
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What?

368
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're not going to give it back?

369
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not going to give it back.

370
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're not going to give it back.

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What's that?

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What's that?

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Blue man.

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's too big.

375
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's right.

376
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's too big.

377
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's too big.

378
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's too big.

379
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's too big.

380
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why would you wear it in your house?

381
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I forgot.

382
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
When I took it off.

383
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It is the same.

384
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It says Obayashi.

385
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's evidence.

386
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Isn't it Obayashi?

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm gonna wear it quickly.

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He's a scat.

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can tell right away.

392
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I can tell right away.

393
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I can tell right away.

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It says 182 on that film.

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It says 182 on that film.

396
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Seriously?

397
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, sir.

398
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You don't smell at all.

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

401
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wait a minute.

402
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What is it?

403
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Wait a minute.

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes.

405
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is it?

406
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What is it?

407
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think you know.

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes.

409
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Before that, I'll give you back your memories.

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Bulma?

411
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

412
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You said you forgot.

413
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is...

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Whose is this?

415
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's yours, isn't it?

416
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's yours, isn't it?

417
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What do you think?

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know.

419
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know.

420
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Put it in.

421
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's dirty.

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, I think you already know.

423
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

424
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What?

426
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm getting married.

427
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, it seems so.

428
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Congratulations.

429
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you very much.

430
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's still a lot left.

431
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's nothing left.

432
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It doesn't matter.

433
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you mean it doesn't matter?

434
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It doesn't matter.

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It doesn't matter at all.

436
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It doesn't matter at all.

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's over.

438
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think it's amazing that we're on the same page.

439
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I thought it was a ball and attacked.

440
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Please get rid of that feeling.

441
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, it's okay.

442
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I was attacked.

443
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Really?

444
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Really?

445
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All right.

446
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Can I run away?

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Ball?

448
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's a ball.

449
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a good ball.

450
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You can hit it, but you can't run away like that.

451
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You can't run away like that.

452
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It hurts.

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It hurts.

454
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know.

455
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It hurts.

456
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It hurts.

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Your hands are big, too.

458
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It was hard to clean up when we were dating.

459
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm relieved.

460
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's good.

461
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
All right.

462
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's go to Disney.

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's go.

464
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I want to go to Disney.

465
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Wait a minute.

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What?

467
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm still here.

468
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What?

469
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're still here.

470
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm surprised.

471
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Actually, the last one is Morio.

472
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Morio.

473
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Mori Man's Morio.

474
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Mori Man?

475
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's Mori Man.

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, no, no, no.

477
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I thought it was a game.

478
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I thought so.

479
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's completely different.

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It was very hot.

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was a battle.

482
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It was hotter in the ring.

483
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Their bodies.

484
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know that, right?

485
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You don't know, do you?

486
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you look at it, you don't know, do you?

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Really?

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm a junior from Yoshimoto.

489
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm a junior, too.

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm a junior, too.

491
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm a junior, too.

492
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm a junior, too.

493
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm a junior, too.

494
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Kana is my wife's type.

495
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Who?

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Kana.

497
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's Morio.

499
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Her real name is Kana Sawagami.

500
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
She's a great guy.

501
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why are you looking at me?

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was saying she was cute.

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's all I said.

504
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She's a well-made woman.

505
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's go.

506
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's go to bed.

507
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't want to go to bed.

508
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Kana.

509
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Shut up.

510
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What?

511
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What?

512
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Today.

513
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sure you know.

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We're getting married.

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why can't we get married?

516
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What's the score?

517
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know.

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's funny that we're getting married.

519
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you remember the song?

520
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What?

521
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's walk together.

522
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
At night.

523
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you doing?

524
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's stop.

525
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Stop it.

526
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Morio.

527
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Morio.

528
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Stop it.

529
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't want to get married.

530
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What's wrong with you?

531
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not what you said.

532
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I said turn.

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I said turn.

534
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's wrong with you?

535
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't want to get married.

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll tell you.

537
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you serious?

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He's driving me crazy.

539
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We were dating.

540
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What?

541
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What's wrong?

542
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There's a ring.

543
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's a ring.

544
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What?

546
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you going to do?

547
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We can go to the end.

548
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's right.

549
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know if that's the best way to break up.

550
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The match of fate begins.

551
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Ayamasaki.

552
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

553
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's give it all we've got.

554
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

555
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Good luck.

556
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's do it.

557
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Go for it.

558
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Good luck.

559
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Good luck.

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Good luck.

561
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've got this.

562
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't usually carry this, so I'm going to grab it.

563
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ready.

564
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Go.

565
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It hurts.

566
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Good luck and win.

567
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It hurts.

568
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Wait a minute.

569
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You should do it.

570
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hurry up.

571
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Wait a minute.

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It hurts.

573
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It hurts.

574
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It hurts.

575
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Wait a minute.

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you.

577
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you.

578
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What's wrong with you?

579
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What's wrong with you?

580
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're getting married, aren't you?

581
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're the father, aren't you?

582
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's right.

583
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Is it okay for a father to do such a thing?

584
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I want to bet with you!

585
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Father.

586
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Good luck, father!

587
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, okay.

588
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Here I go!

589
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, it's coming.

590
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, that's good.

591
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, that's good.

592
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's a tie, it's a tie.

593
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What?

594
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, it's in my pants.

595
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, it's in my mouth.

596
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Zaki-san!

597
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Zaki-san, call me!

598
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yamazaki!

599
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He's a foreigner, a foreigner.

600
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Bring me some water!

601
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Bring it yourself!

602
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why don't you do it properly?

603
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll do it again if it's possible.

604
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's easy to do it in the woods.

605
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Take off your goggles.

606
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Stop it, stop it.

607
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

608
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No, no, no.

609
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, no, no.

610
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, no, no.

611
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, no, no.

612
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, no, no.

613
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What's wrong?

614
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What's wrong?

615
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can open it.

616
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The goggles were loose.

617
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's why I told you to do it properly.

618
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But you...

619
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's not your fault.

620
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's my fault.

621
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not your fault.

622
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I told you to do it properly.

623
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't use too much power.

624
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The last one!

625
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Kodama Watermelon Shiba Inu!

626
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Here we go!

627
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Good luck!

628
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There's still some left.

629
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There's still some left.

630
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's still some left.

631
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's still some left.

632
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There's still some left.

633
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Here we go!

634
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's like a stone bridge in the woods.

635
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's like a stone bridge in the woods.

636
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What?

637
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't want to fight in this way.

638
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's like a stone bridge in the woods.

639
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yamada.

640
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I've always loved you.

641
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What?

642
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You're an idiot.

643
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You're an idiot.

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're an idiot.

645
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Are you stupid?

646
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Are you stupid?

647
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Are you stupid?

648
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's true.

649
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's true.

650
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You look happy.

651
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You look happy.

652
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't do it.

653
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't keep my eyes off you.

654
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I can't keep my eyes off you.

655
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're happy.

656
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You're happy.

657
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're an idiot.

658
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You're an idiot.

659
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You're married.

660
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why?

661
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why are you doing that?

662
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're still doing it?

663
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's my birthday every year, so I'd like to say something.

664
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm so happy.

665
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Happy birthday to you.

666
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Say it properly.

667
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I sang it many times during the planning session today.
