1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chikishiki Gentenpapa!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What are we going to do today?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today...

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There was a long time ago.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is it?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The corner of Gentenpapa.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, I see.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
One person.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A child came out.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And he heard a lot of stories about his father.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I see.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And he drew a portrait.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And his father came out.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I draw the portrait.

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Isn't that obvious?

20
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I really wanted to draw a portrait.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Please take a look, Mr. Tezuka.

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, let's have the children come out.

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Come out.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please show the children the portrait.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Your father is Iwakashi Pot, isn't he?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
From the Lion.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Please tell me your name.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm Kotaro.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Kotaro.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Have you ever been hit by your father?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Only once.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Only once?

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When did your father hit you?

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He hit me with his shoes.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At that time...

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought my father was very strict.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, your father hit you with his shoes.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why?

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because he can't speak properly?

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your mother is a beautiful woman.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know you, but don't hit me.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm scared.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Please tell me your characteristics.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First of all, from the outline.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The face is long.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The body is long.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well...

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's too long.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How does your hair look like?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Doesn't it look like you?

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Really?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you have a side hair?

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, I have a side hair.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is your ear big?

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How big is your ear?

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's long.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's big.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey!

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's better to draw a big face.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How about eyebrows?

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's thick.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It looks like you, doesn't it?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The shape of your eyes...

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's different from the shape of your eyes.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's eyebrows.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How about your eyes?

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is it perfect? Is it thin?

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's long.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's thin and long.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry. Can't you see it?

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is it thick?

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's thick.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's thick.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's dangerous.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How about your nose?

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's long.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's long.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's thick.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's thick.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It looks like you, doesn't it?

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How about your mouth?

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's thick.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's like this.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And it's like your son's face.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's ask your father.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Please, father.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's that?

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's like you.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's like you.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's like you.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's like you.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's like you.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's like you.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's call him again.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Mr. Harada.

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Your hair...

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's good.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're in front of everyone.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's beautiful.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not confident.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You hit your back.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not like that.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's long.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not pretending.

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I forgot the situation.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I was angry.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You were angry.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I was angry because it was important.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I said it out loud.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's why I was angry.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was a playboy.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Really?

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I went to my work in high school.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was fun.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You like going to work?

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I like going to work.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I like going to work.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When I went to work...

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Call me Mr. Daisho.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mr. Daisho?

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm your father.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I called you Harada.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Harada, bring me a cigarette.

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I said yes.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I didn't say anything at home.

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
When you go to work...

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When you go to work...

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's like saying now.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you get angry, you'll get angry, right?

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What about getting angry?

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I get angry three times.

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey!

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey!

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I see.

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't get angry.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Today, I'm going to ask Mr. Daisho a lot of questions.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'd like you to answer them.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
First question.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What do you want your father to fix here?

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Pee?

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you poop?

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You poop as much as you poop.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's pretty big.

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's pretty big.

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's pretty big.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There's no shape in your hair.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not a fart.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's not a fart.

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's about appearance.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I got it.

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I want you to be careful about your clothes.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do you always wear casual clothes?

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't wear casual clothes.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's pretty close.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The answer is...

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have a bad sense of fashion.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I thought it was a new drama.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The last question.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The last question.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What do you think of Kotaro when you see your father on a variety show?

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think it's wonderful.

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You don't think so.

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I only answered one question.

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I feel sorry for him.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a little different.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a national opinion.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I got it.

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a public opinion.

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I got it.

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
People draw.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

179
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hello.

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's been a while since I've dressed up like this.

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's like a comic back.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to take a walk slowly today.

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sleepy.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's not the time to talk cheerfully.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I sometimes watch the video and think.

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's strange if you're in a good mood.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's strange if you're in a good mood at 1 o'clock in the middle of the night.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's sing a song.

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's like a lullaby.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's like a lullaby.

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sing in the middle of the night.

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's like a lullaby.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You said you dropped your wallet last week.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You dropped it again.

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You dropped your wallet before, didn't you?

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I dropped my wallet.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You bought it again, didn't you?

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You dropped it again.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I dropped it again.

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I dropped it.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was stolen.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I went to the parking lot with my friend.

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It was 6 cents.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You left it open.

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I left it open.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It was stolen.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What was stolen?

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think it was a fan.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It was stolen.

212
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's expensive.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's expensive.

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In a sense, it's very expensive.

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Really?

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you sad?

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm very sad.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I want you to return it to me now.

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's pretty expensive.

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's expensive.

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There was a plastic bag in the back of the car.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Pants.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you kidding me?

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What is that?

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It was really stolen.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The pants I changed the day before.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where did you change your pants in the car?

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You changed your pants in the car a long time ago.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I didn't change my pants in the car.

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're lying.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I had a lot of clothes in the car.

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I didn't change my pants in the car.

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You changed your pants in the car.

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I had the pants I changed the day before.

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I changed my pants today.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I like cars.

241
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know.

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I was driving very hard.

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My pants came off from here.

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I put it in the back.

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How did you change your pants?

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You were wearing just one pair of pants.

247
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I changed my pants to tie the side.

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're lying.

249
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't change my pants.

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You changed your pants once.

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I changed my pants once.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You were so dirty.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was already dirty when I changed my pants.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why?

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's so light.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why?

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Maybe I was really dirty.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's because I have a bad anus.

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Because I'm a homo.

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Why?

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why do you use it?

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's the same as men.

263
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What? What? What?

264
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't know.

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know.

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know.

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't know.

268
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't know.

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's because I have a bad anus.

270
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because I have a bad anus.

271
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I saw it.

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

273
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know.

274
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think they are watching TV.

275
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't cry.

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think you're a bad person.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If there is a talent you admire,

280
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If there is a talent you admire,

281
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you want panty?

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think I have a chance.

283
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's what men think.

284
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's what men think.

285
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Women want men's panty.

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you want panty?

287
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm just saying.

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm just saying.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What?

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If there is no one,

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If there is no one,

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I have panty.

293
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have panty.

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have panty.

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have panty.

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm living alone.

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't belong to any group.

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Panty is all mine.

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's a great, father.

300
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have panty.

301
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
My terrifying panty.

302
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm only wearing panty of aniki.

303
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
My terrifying panty.

304
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Then here's magic...

305
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:09,940
This already

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You would know his love.

307
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's right.

308
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How can he do this?

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I've seen it, but I've never seen you wearing it.

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You've never done such a thing.

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What?

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Everyone knows that you've stolen underwear.

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You've stolen underwear, haven't you?

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

315
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You've worn those underwear, haven't you?

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Just once!

317
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You've been in a commercial, haven't you?

318
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Good evening.

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tanaka Miyuki, you've done a lot of film reviews.

320
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But you've done a lot of film reviews in front of me.

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Who do you think you are?

322
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't like movies.

323
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What movies have you been moved by?

324
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I've been moved by Spanish movies.

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Spanish movies are not good at all.

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You've never seen Spanish movies, have you?

327
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I have.

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What kind of Spanish movies have you seen?

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What movies?

330
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What movies?

331
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm asking you here.

332
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What kind of Spanish movies have you seen?

333
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't care about Spanish movies.

334
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you serious?

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't know Spanish movies.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What kind of Spanish movies have you seen?

337
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, what did you do in Spain?

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Think! Think!

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A bright red Spain.

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Thank you very much.

341
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't like movies.

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Did you see the commercial?

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I did.

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What did you see?

345
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What did you see?

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Everyone said they saw it.

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
For example, what did you see?

348
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I saw everything, so I can't say anything.

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why can't you say anything?

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you saw it, you can say it.

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I saw it.

352
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What are you doing now?

353
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Kagerou.

354
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I saw Kagerou.

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What?

356
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Who is the main character?

357
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's it.

358
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That was amazing.

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What?

360
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you asking?

361
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Tell me the name.

362
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well,

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
George Shimaki was in the movie.

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Is that so?

365
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm asking about the main character.

366
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's George Shimaki.

367
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What kind of role did George Shimaki play?

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What?

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What kind of role did George Shimaki play?

370
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He was very depressed.

371
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Was he depressed?

372
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
George was depressed.

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If you said you wanted to do this gag,

374
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you were really in the movie.

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's enough.

376
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was your assistant.

377
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you very much.

378
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll go from here.

379
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
There's this.

380
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Matcha's burdock.

381
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Matcha's burdock, an alkaline fiber food.

382
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's something like this.

383
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not a big deal.

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm your assistant.

385
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Thank you very much.

386
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Sometimes,

387
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I see Matsumoto taking off his pants.

388
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you have a reason?

389
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What do you think?

390
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I use this kind of thing a lot.

391
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
My butt has been sticking out a lot.

392
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Is that so?

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's sticking out a lot.

394
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You can see my butt, right?

395
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If my butt was on the road.

396
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

397
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Probably.

398
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Right?

399
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

400
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Matsumoto's butt is sticking out.

401
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If my butt was on the road,

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I would think,

403
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
when will Hamada deliver it to me?

404
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I thought about it after watching the punishment game.

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think that punishment game is too bad.

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why?

407
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What will Matsumoto do if he catches a cold?

408
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The people watching are embarrassed by that.

409
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The game is related to sports,

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
so Matsumoto doesn't seem to win.

411
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Try using your head next time.

412
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then I think both will be the same.

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's too bad.

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is strange.

415
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The person who decided the punishment game is this person.

416
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you lose this time,

417
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
if you say,

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
let's do this punishment,

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
it's this person.

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Even if you lose,

421
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
there's nothing to be sad about.

422
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's natural.

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But,

424
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I want you to think about one thing.

425
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
At that time,

426
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I went to Nami, right?

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes.

428
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I was a man, right?

429
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes.

430
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
At that time,

431
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
you were doing something like,

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
go!

433
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
At that time,

434
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
even if I won that baseball,

435
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if you go that far,

436
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I won't hesitate,

437
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll jump in without hesitation.

438
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's the kind of man I am.

439
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's annoying.

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's the kind of man I am.

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's annoying.

442
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
At that time,

443
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you were doing something like...

444
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What?

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What?

446
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
When I fell with a parachute,

447
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
why didn't you jump with me?

448
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I jumped.

449
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You didn't jump.

450
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I jumped.

451
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Didn't you fall in the cesspool?

452
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Everyone doesn't know,

453
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but I jumped.

454
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
When did you jump?

455
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What?

456
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You didn't jump.

457
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I gently,

458
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
when you were in the main,

459
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
didn't stand out too much,

460
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I jumped like this.

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You didn't jump.

462
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The camera just didn't cover it.

463
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You didn't jump.

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You didn't jump.

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So,

466
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
next time,

467
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I want you to think about

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
something you don't like.

469
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll think about it.

470
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's play a game together

471
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and if I lose,

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
it's like,

473
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
unconditionally,

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm going to be beaten up.

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's right.

476
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If you do something

477
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and you lose,

478
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that's right.

479
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The other day,

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
you said you wanted to do judo,

481
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
so I said I wanted to do judo,

482
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
but you threw me.

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's right.

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But what's good about it?

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What's good about it?

486
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I can study

487
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
with my head.

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can't do math.

489
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're terrible.

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Everyone was playing.

491
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When we were in middle school,

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
when we were studying together,

493
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
you were playing in the sand.

494
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're stupid.

495
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Or,

496
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm going to solve

497
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
a drill in the first grade of elementary school.

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes.

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let's try it.

500
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
In the first grade of elementary school,

501
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it's a little too easy.

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In the sixth grade of elementary school,

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

504
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's hard.

505
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That was good.

506
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's hard.

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In the sixth grade,

508
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it's a little hard.

509
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
In the sixth grade?

510
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The society of sixth graders.

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Society?

512
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes.

513
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What's the national language?

514
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

515
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Kanji?

516
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't know the Kanji.

517
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If it's Kanji,

518
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I can win.

519
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's not talk about Kanji.

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's talk about Zuko.

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's not good. You'll win.

522
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You were pretty good at Zuko.

523
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You were good at Toten-Pol.

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I was really good at it.

525
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You were good at Shogoku-Toten-Pol.

526
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You threw me out in the middle, so you were good at Baba.

527
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Don't you know?

528
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm the one who can win.

529
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why?

530
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm the one who can win.

531
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's dirty.

532
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Think about it next time.

533
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What do you mean by next time?

534
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We were going to do something together.

535
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What happened?

536
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We were going to do something together.

537
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What happened?

538
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We were going to do something together.

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have to think about it.

540
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
With Gyo-san?

541
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes, with about 1000 people.

542
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's do something that will make them cry.

543
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Something that will make them cry?

544
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's ask them to do something.

545
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's do a puppet show.

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What kind of puppet show?

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's go somewhere like Machibiko House.

548
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There's no such thing as Machibiko House.

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why?

550
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Grandpas and grandmas took a bath together.

551
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't you have that kind of sense?

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Do you really think so?

553
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I do.

554
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why do you want to wash your grandpa?

555
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't want to wash him at all.

556
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's fine.

557
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want to be moved by him.

558
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Are you stupid?

559
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Have you ever seen a man who is moved by his grandpa?

560
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm moved by him.

561
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You should do it at home.

562
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I can't do it at home.

563
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Shut up.

564
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll do it for you.

565
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Wait a minute.

566
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What?

567
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Watch this.

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll make you look like him.

569
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll make you look like him.

570
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll make you look like him.

571
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll make you look like him.

572
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I want to see it.

573
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Me too.

574
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What did you just say?

575
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What?

576
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The one that everyone does.

577
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If you have an idea.

578
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Who wants to participate?

579
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This one.

580
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What is this?

581
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What do you mean by everyone?

582
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's right.

583
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm the only one who can do it.

584
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's why I'm telling you to recruit.

585
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You don't have to talk.

586
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you listening?

587
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's been 10 years for me and Konmi.

588
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know if I can still do it.

589
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Good evening.

590
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Good evening.

591
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So,

592
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm going to do something with everyone.

593
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm going to get ideas.

594
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What kind of things do you want to do?

595
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Have you decided on the number of people?

596
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think it's about 1,000 people.

597
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
If it's more than that, I won't have anything to do.

598
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But,

599
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
1,000 people are the main characters.

600
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We don't do much.

601
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We basically sit in a chair.

602
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I see.

603
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You watch over them.

604
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's good.

605
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's right.

606
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's right.

607
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll say it again.

608
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's right.

609
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
If we get it,

610
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
we'll watch the V-app in the studio.

611
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I see.

612
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's like Kanji.

613
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's like Genki.

614
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's like Takeshi.

615
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's right.

616
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's not like Takeshi.

617
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's like Matsukaza.

618
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's enough.

619
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm looking for ideas.

620
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Please let me know.

621
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Also,

622
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
please let me know if you have any questions.

623
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Today,

624
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
the assistant is a normal person.

625
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So,

626
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm not going to waste your time.

627
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
See you next week.

628
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Bye-bye.
