1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukaya, we'll be shooting with Reikan Caddy.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm scared today.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm a little worried.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What's scary is the traffic jam.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It took me 5 hours.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This time, we're going to a haunted spot. Let's see how many photos we can take.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, the downtown team, the Kogoriko team, and Mr. Yamazaki.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As for the rules...

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you take a photo of the point you took and there's one ghost in it...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One ghost?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If there's one ghost in it...

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're treating me like I'm a ghost?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're treating me like I'm a ghost?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're treating me like I'm a ghost?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're treating me like I'm a ghost?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're treating me like I'm a ghost?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If there's one ghost in it, you get one point.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If there's one ghost in it, you get one point.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The team with the most points will receive...

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A gift from Hawaii.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you kidding me?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's okay.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We won't be able to see the ghost course just by ourselves.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We'll have the caddies guide us through the course.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
First, from the hellish Oyama amusement park, Sakura.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Please welcome Mr. Kinzo.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're too excited.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He's so excited.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Kinzo.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mr. Kinzo.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you okay?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're fooling around.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You have to follow my instructions.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're serious, right?

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's dangerous.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're packing good stuff.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What is this?

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is number 9.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Number 9.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's a lot.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's a lot.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is number 1.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is number 1.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't copy the good kids.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Next, number 9.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The ghost guide boss, Oda Mudo.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's Anomita.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hello.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When a monk comes in, he says, good morning.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I thought you'd have to do your best.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're wearing a mask.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll do my best to not forget that it's Anomita.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll do my best.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Last but not least, the best stair talent in Japan, Inagawa Junji.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, no, no, no.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's dangerous.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's dangerous.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's scary.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's really scary.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to make everyone happy today.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't know what you want to see.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to show you what I can do.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a good day.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The location was delayed today.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think it's better to stop.

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think so, too.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think it was delayed in the sense that it might not come.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It usually happens that way, but it's not like this.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The ghost guide is on the wrong way.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to say.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
When a monk is in a hurry, he steps on the floor.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, my God.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone, get in line.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, my God.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, my God.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh, my God.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, my God.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, my God.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Before shooting at a haunted spot, I had Mr. Kadi and his friends tell me scary stories.

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The big bird is Junji Inagawa.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A very scary story has come up.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is two years ago.

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was spring.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have a friend.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My family is close to me.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My friend contacted me.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My daughter graduated from college and started a broadcasting company.

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know what to do because I don't know the industry.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was wondering if there was a good place.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I happened to have a store in Suginami.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I took a train from my parents' house.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was told to look for it.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't tell you the name of the station, but it's Suginami.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My daughter's apartment is 80 cm from the ground.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a two-story apartment on the ground.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My girlfriend is on the first floor.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's spring, but I'm still a student at school.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to a company, so I asked my girlfriend to come out.

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My girlfriend told me that she would do something like this again.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My girlfriend told me that she would do something like this again.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My girlfriend told me that she would do something like this again.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
My girlfriend sent me to a place where I could live.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My girlfriend sent me to a place where I could live.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was drunk and nervous.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I fell asleep.

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I slept in the bathroom.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know what time it is.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yuki-chan

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yuki-chan

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I woke up to a voice.

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yuki-chan

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She woke up.

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She said she was walking her dog at night.

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I thought it was strange.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yuki-chan

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yuki-chan

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yuki-chan

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yuki-chan

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yuki-chan

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yuki-chan

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yuki-chan

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yuki-chan

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yuki-chan

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yuki-chan

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yuki-chan

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yuki-chan

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yuki-chan

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yuki-chan

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When I think in a calm way

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Even nothing can be forced.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you see her?

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you see her?

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I apologize.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It felt good, didn't it?

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I fell asleep.

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know how much time passed.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was that voice again.

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was very close.

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was wearing a futon.

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I heard a click.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I opened my eyes.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are we going to do tomorrow?

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And...

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Apparently,

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
she was in her own room.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She came into the room.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
At that time, she thought,

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm not a human.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't get into the room without a sound.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I thought the situation was different.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When I put my earphones on,

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I heard a click.

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then I said,

166
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What are we going to do tomorrow?

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
When I heard a click,

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't know what was going on.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was very happy.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I didn't know what was going on.

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I just heard a click.

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then I heard a click.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And then I heard a click.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was wearing a futon.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are we going to do tomorrow?

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I was wearing a futon.

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was pushed.

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I could see it moving.

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
She was pushing the futon with her face.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She was pushing the futon with her face.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And then she whispered in her ear.

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And then she whispered in her ear.

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What are we going to do tomorrow?

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I could feel her breath.

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Please come back.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please come back.

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I heard a click.

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey, Yuki-chan.

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What are we going to do tomorrow?

193
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Please come back.

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please come back.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I heard a click.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I thought,

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then I left.

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The next day, she left without her luggage.

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The next day, she left without her luggage.

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But she still has her apartment.

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm scared.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's stop.

203
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm scared.

204
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm scared.

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And the next spiritual spot

206
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And the next spiritual spot

207
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
will be explained by Oda.

208
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And the next spiritual spot

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
will be explained by Oda.

210
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's the God's Tower.

211
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a tunnel with a strong connection.

212
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a tunnel with a strong connection.

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you see the spirit,

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You'll see something

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
A little beyond the middle.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
A little beyond the middle.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't think you can

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Get there.

219
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is there anything there?

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It is a place

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A long time ago.

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
A place where murderers

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I killed him and dragged him into the room.

224
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, if you could get in from the other side, what would you do?

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mr. Yamazaki...

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Wait a minute.

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you very much.

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why are you alone?

229
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You said you could get in by yourself with a digital camera.

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You said you couldn't get in at all.

231
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can get in by yourself with a digital camera.

232
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll have you do it.

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't do it.

234
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't.

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you very much.

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I couldn't do it.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't do it.

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The place they're going to this time is a certain tunnel in the Kanto area.

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Near that tunnel, various incidents have occurred.

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a devil's tunnel where countless spirits come and go.

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Will they really be able to take pictures of the ghosts?

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
At 11 o'clock in the afternoon, they finally set off for the devil's tunnel.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey, everyone.

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We're on our way to the scene of the devil's tunnel.

245
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's like a 4 minute boat ride.

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's the first time we've had such a fun filming.

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This is no good.

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is no good.

249
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't you feel it yet?

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
As the filming bus went deeper and deeper into the mountains,

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
they couldn't hide their anxiety.

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is no good.

253
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't do it.

254
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't do it.

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can't do it.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't do it.

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can't do it.

258
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
At first, the spirit caddies started to look down at the tunnel.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going to announce it.

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's coming out.

261
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wait a minute.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Inagawa-san.

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Amazing.

264
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What is it?

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Inagawa-san.

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please announce it.

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is...

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's coming out.

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yamazaki can't hide his anxiety with the words of Inagawa Junji.

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It seems like there's a ghost inside.

272
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's not like there's a ghost.

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There is, right?

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There is.

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's not like there's a ghost.

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All the caddies are looking down at us.

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
To be honest, this course is for beginners.

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We're really beginners.

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Especially today, we're against it.

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We're really against it, right?

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is tough.

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's really tough.

283
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It seems like we can't go on like we said at first.

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
For the sake of the fear, Young and Adalto changed the shooting of the two teams.

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
First, the young team led by Inagawa caddies went to the tunnel.

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

287
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going.

288
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Be careful.

289
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's okay.

290
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's okay.

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why are you doing that?

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's okay.

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's scary.

294
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's scary.

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's amazing.

296
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We can't go in.

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why?

298
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We can't go in.

299
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We can't go in.

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We can't go in.

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We can't go in.

302
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We can't go in.

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hang in there.

304
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How far are we going to go?

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's go.

306
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's go.

307
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
How far are we going to go?

308
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait a minute.

309
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Wait a minute.

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What is it?

311
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Won't it disappear?

312
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

313
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why?

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We can't go in any further.

315
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's okay.

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's okay.

317
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's go.

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What is it?

319
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's scary.

320
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What are you doing?

321
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's scary.

322
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What is it?

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, no, no.

324
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's not me.

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you doing?

326
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What are you doing?

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Manon was surprised.

328
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He was surprised.

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's scary.

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What is it?

331
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was scared.

332
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was scared.

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait a minute.

334
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait a minute.

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm already out of breath.

336
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What is this?

337
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What is this?

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What is this?

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's on the chair.

340
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's on the chair.

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What is this?

342
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No, no, no.

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's on the chair.

344
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The Young team is finally entering the tunnel.

345
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is amazing.

346
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What is this?

347
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is incredible.

348
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The top and the front.

349
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's calling.

350
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's calling.

351
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's incredible.

352
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's incredible.

353
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Wait a minute.

354
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What is this?

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go.

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The ceiling is incredible.

357
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's incredible.

358
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Did you see that?

359
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I didn't.

360
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

361
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry, but...

362
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why did you do that?

363
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's go.

364
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's go.

366
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you don't come closer,

367
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the walls will turn black.

368
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The person will be reflected,

369
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
but the scenery will be dark.

370
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What should I do?

371
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to be carried to the wall.

372
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I want to be carried to the wall.

373
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I want to be carried.

374
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I want to be carried.

375
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Can I take a picture here?

376
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Take a picture.

377
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Is there anyone behind you?

378
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

379
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What is this?

380
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What is this?

381
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Behind you.

382
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's someone behind you.

383
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Stop it.

384
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Stop it.

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Stop it.

386
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Stop it.

387
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's someone in front of you.

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
There's someone in front of you.

389
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Take a picture.

390
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Where?

391
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There.

392
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where?

393
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There.

394
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There.

395
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There.

396
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There.

397
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There.

398
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There.

399
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There.

400
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There.

401
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There.

402
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There.

403
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There.

404
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Let's go back.

405
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's go.

406
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No, wait a minute.

407
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's go back quickly.

408
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No, no.

409
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ah, this is bad.

410
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Isn't there anywhere to go?

411
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I did my best.

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey!

413
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

414
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hey!

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What?

416
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This.

417
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is all black.

418
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Look.

419
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Everyone is black, look.

420
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Look.

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Look.

422
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's a white ball.

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's a white ball.

424
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This black face is a symptom, isn't it?

425
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This face is really scary.

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's scary.

427
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, this is useless.

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a summer project.

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey!

430
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What?

431
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I won't open it.

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

433
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Go away!

434
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What are you closing?

435
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Why are you silent?

436
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You can't close it here and there.

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Go and close it over there.

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If you're going to close it.

439
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Close it in the toilet.

440
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Please.

441
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Please.

442
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Please.

443
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There are 10 wheels.

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Go up.

445
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Go up.

446
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Go up.

447
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's okay to close it, isn't it?

448
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes.

449
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
After this, what happened in the tunnel of evil?

450
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why am I a bridge?

451
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In a place like this.

452
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Wait.

453
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's right.

454
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Wait.

455
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There is a reaction on the right.

456
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's right.

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
There is a reaction.

458
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's right.

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
On the right.

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
On the right.

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
On the right.

462
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
On the right.

463
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
On the right.

464
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's a little further.

465
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

466
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's over.

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's over.

468
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's over.

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you doing?

470
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You have to get on the car.

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Why?

472
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
About one.

473
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What happened?

474
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's okay, Sakurai.

475
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What is this?

476
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's okay.

477
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What is this?

478
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Then, let's take one more.

479
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

480
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Shall we go?

481
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

482
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
One by one.

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because it's a big deal.

484
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please stick to the wall.

485
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is this okay?

486
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Is this okay?

487
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's a little strange.

488
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There are two people in the car.

489
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Go.

490
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes.

491
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Did you get on the car?

492
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I got on.

493
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I got on the car.

494
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

495
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I heard a voice.

496
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I heard a voice.

497
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What was it?

498
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It was a big wind.

499
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What is it?

500
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I definitely heard the voice.

501
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I heard it on this side too.

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I see.

503
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What should I do?

504
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You heard a voice?

505
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't hear that.

506
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I definitely heard it from this side.

507
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then, what should I do?

508
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think we should go back.

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's okay. Whatever happens, it's okay.

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's be quiet for a bit.

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay.

512
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Look.

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's coming.

514
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's reacting.

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's be quiet for a bit.

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's behind us.

517
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's definitely behind us.

518
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

519
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's walking.

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's trying to walk.

521
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is bad.

522
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What?

523
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I think we should go back.

524
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's coming.

525
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's coming.

526
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's good.

527
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's be quiet for a bit.

528
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's go back.

529
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is bad.

530
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There are only two lanterns.

531
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's hard.

532
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's different from here.

533
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The air is heavy.

534
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This is heavy.

535
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What is this?

536
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's coming from behind.

537
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
My head hurts.

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
My head hurts.

539
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What is that?

540
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's making a perfect sound.

541
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What is that?

542
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We should go back.

543
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's be quiet for a bit.

544
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's go back.

545
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's on both knees.

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's trying to cut.

547
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Who is it?

548
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's the staff.

549
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's coming.

550
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's coming.

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's coming.

552
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't understand.

553
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What should we do?

554
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's coming from behind.

555
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's still there.

556
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's still there.

557
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's still there.

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Really?

559
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's looking at us.

560
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's hard to see.

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's the one behind us.

562
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's the one behind us.

563
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's the one behind us.

564
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's go back.

565
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's go back.

566
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's go back.

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's really fast.

568
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Did it hit me?

It didn't hit you.

I didn't say anything.

Something hit my shoulder.
