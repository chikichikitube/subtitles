1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
We found a really good restaurant.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
We told them to bring us there.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
What's that? A food court?

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,200
That's what it's called.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
We didn't know it would be this crowded.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
It's already crowded.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
I don't know what's going on.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
It's not like that.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
What is it?

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
We made a lot of reservations.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,200
But we're finally here.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Really?

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
Was there a famous restaurant?

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
It's here.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
It's here?

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
It's a restaurant.

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
There it is.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
He's looking at us.

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
He's looking at us.

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Good morning.

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Is the camera off?

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
I don't think so.

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
We're finally here.

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,200
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Good morning.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
You're late.

27
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
This is the famous restaurant.

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
It must have been hard.

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
It was.

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
When I said I was coming,

31
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,200
a lot of people came to see us.

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm really sorry.

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
What?

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm listening.

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
We're here.

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Who are you listening to?

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
We have a lot of reservations.

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
We got them today.

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Yeah, we got them.

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I wouldn't have called a regular restaurant.

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,200
We're all busy.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Except you.

43
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Don't say that.

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
We're busy.

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
But in Tokyo,

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
there are a lot of celebrities.

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
That's right.

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Of course.

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
You see them in magazines.

50
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
You see celebrities here.

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
I don't.

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
It's not like that.

53
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
It's not?

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I was surprised.

55
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I came here for work.

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,200
There are a lot of celebrities here.

57
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
What?

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
What?

59
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
What's that?

60
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
There are a lot of celebrities here.

61
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
They don't move like that.

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
That's right.

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
While we're waiting,

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
maybe today...

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
What?

66
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
What?

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
What?

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Kijime Shiro?

69
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Wait a minute.

70
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Kijime Shiro?

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Kijime Shiro?

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
He's running.

73
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Kijime Shiro?

74
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
He's running.

75
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Wait a minute.

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Kijime Shiro?

77
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Kijime Shiro?

78
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
He'll be surprised.

79
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
What?

80
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
We're telling you.

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
He'll be surprised.

82
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
He's not being chased.

83
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
He's not being chased.

84
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Nobody's here.

85
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
He's not being chased.

86
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
He's not being chased.

87
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
There are a lot of celebrities here on Christmas Eve.

88
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
For the sake of it.

89
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
For the sake of it.

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
It's a couple.

91
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
There's a lot of celebrities.

92
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,700
Seriously, this place is...

93
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
What?

94
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
He's running!

95
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Who's that?

96
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Wait a minute!

97
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Isn't that Suu-san?

98
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
That's Suu-san.

99
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,200
Who's Suu-san?

100
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,700
It's Suu, right?

101
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
Is this Suu Tomitoku?

102
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
He's here!

103
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
There's no doubt about it.

104
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,200
It's Suu Tomitoku!

105
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
Suu Tomitoku is running!

106
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,200
You'll be surprised!

107
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,700
There's no doubt about it.

108
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,700
There's no doubt about it?

109
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
He's running again.

110
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
If everyone's running to the other side,

111
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
there must be something there.

112
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
That's what I thought at first, too.

113
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Hey, Mimato-san!

114
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Mimato-san's running!

115
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
That's Mimato, right?

116
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,700
That's Mimato-san.

117
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Mimato's running like crazy!

118
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,700
That's amazing!

119
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,700
But Mimato-san's house is around here.

120
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
It's called Nakano.

121
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
It might be.

122
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
It's an amazing store.

123
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
People who watch us on TV

124
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,700
only know that it's Nakano.

125
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
That's right.

126
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Who's this?

127
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
He's running.

128
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
It's Marianne!

129
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Marianne!

130
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Marianne's running!

131
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Why is Marianne running?

132
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
That's amazing!

133
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,700
There's no time to talk!

134
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
What's going on?

135
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,700
What's going on?

136
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
If he starts running,

137
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
this is...

138
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
That's why I thought

139
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,700
I should apologize for calling you.

140
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,700
No, not at all.

141
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
I wanted to show you.

142
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
I'm so happy!

143
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
By the way, who was running?

144
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,700
That was amazing!

145
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,700
From Mori no Fukuro...

146
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Who's Mori?

147
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Pappara Kawai.

148
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Who's Mori no Fukuro?

149
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I was looking for Pappara Kawai.

150
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
How many people

151
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,700
are there a day at this pace?

152
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Wait!

153
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Who's that?

154
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
I have no idea.

155
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Isn't that Ijiri?

156
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Really?

157
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Ijiri Okada?

158
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Really?

159
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Poor guy!

160
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
I've never seen anyone running like that.

161
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Is that really Ijiri?

162
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
It's Ijiri Okada.

163
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Poor guy.

164
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,700
I've never seen anyone running like that.

165
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
So far away!

166
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I don't think he's running.

167
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,700
He's just running.

168
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
That's right.

169
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,700
That's why I'm surprised to see him every other month.

170
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,700
He's just running.

171
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
That's right.

172
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Oh?

173
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Not yet?

174
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Shun!

175
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
He's going shopping!

176
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
He's going shopping!

177
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
He's going shopping!

178
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,700
I ordered, but I didn't have the ingredients.

179
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
So I was in a hurry.

180
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
There's a reason for that.

181
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,700
It's said that your wish will come true while you're running.

182
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,700
It's said that your wish will come true while you're running.

183
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
That's right.

184
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
That's right.

185
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Kiyohiko!

186
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Kiyohiko!

187
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,700
I was so tired I just looked at him.

188
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
What?

189
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Kiyohiko!

190
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
I knew it.

191
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
He's running so much.

192
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
I didn't know he was going to run.

193
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
He's running like he's going to bleed.

194
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
That's right.

195
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
It's amazing that he didn't let us do it.

196
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
That's right.

197
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
He didn't let us do it.

198
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
No, no, no!

199
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
That's amazing!

200
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
What?

201
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
What?

202
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
That's Kato Taka!

203
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Kato Taka!

204
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
That's Kato Taka!

205
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
That's Kato Taka!

206
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
That's Kato Taka!

207
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I thought he was going to run over there.

208
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
That's right.

209
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
He's running now.

210
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
It's not like he's going to fall.

211
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
That's right.

212
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Excuse me.

213
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
What?

214
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
He's running.

215
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Who is that?

216
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Who is that?

217
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Who is that?

218
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Who is that?

219
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
That's Heipo.

220
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
That's Kato Taka.

221
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Heipo.

222
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
It has nothing to do with him.

223
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
That's Kato Taka.

224
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
It has nothing to do with him.

225
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
It has nothing to do with him.

226
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
I saw it.

227
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
He's not counted.

228
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
That's right.

229
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
He's not a celebrity.

230
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
Not at all.

231
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Who is this?

232
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
It's close.

233
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
It's close.

234
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
It's Romi Yamada.

235
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
It's Romi Yamada.

236
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
He ran right over here.

237
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
He ran right over here.

238
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
It's Machi Gotan.

239
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
That's amazing.

240
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
What?

241
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
What?

242
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
What?

243
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Who is that?

244
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Who is that?

245
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Who is that?

246
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Shinji Yamashita.

247
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
That's not correct.

248
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Shinji Yamashita it is Shinji Yamashita

249
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
It's not Shinji Yamashita.

250
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
Shinji Yamashita.

251
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
That's Yoshinobu.

252
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Shinji Yamashita.

253
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
That's wrong.

254
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
It's hard to distinguish, but he's actually good.

255
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Is that true?

256
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
That's not true at all.

257
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Really?

258
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
It's really not.

259
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
That's enough.

260
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:11,820
142 00

261
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I'm sorry, it took too much time.

262
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
I want to eat more.

263
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm sorry.

264
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm going home.

265
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Let's go.

266
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Who's this?

267
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Who?

268
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
It's Taka.

269
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
He's going to the bathroom.

270
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
He's in the studio.

271
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
It's almost over.

272
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
It's almost over.

273
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Wait a minute.

274
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
What?

275
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
He's here.

276
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
He's here.

277
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
He's running.

278
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Who's this?

279
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Who's this?

280
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
It's the host, St. Louis.

281
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
St.?

282
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
St.?

283
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
It's St. Louis.

284
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
That's amazing.

285
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Isn't that amazing?

286
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,700
When did you run?

287
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,700
No, Tama.

288
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
It's my first time.

289
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,700
It's my first time.

290
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
It's my first time.

291
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Is it Iji and Machiko?

292
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
No, it's not.

293
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
It was orange.

294
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
It was Ijiri.

295
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
You're surprised.

296
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm not surprised at all.

297
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
St. Louis.

298
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
That's St. Louis.

299
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
There was something.

300
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
He's here.

301
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
It's Ijiri.

302
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
Where?

303
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
He's here.

304
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
This is Ijiri.

305
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Let's take a closer look.

306
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
This is Ijiri.

307
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Let's take a closer look.

308
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Is this Ijiri?

309
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Oh, it's you.

310
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
It's Ijiri.

311
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
It's Ijiri.

312
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
There's no mistake.

313
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
It was Ijiri.

314
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
It was Ijiri.

315
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
It was Ijiri.

316
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
He said,

317
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
I have to go now.

318
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Right?

319
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
But...

320
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Yes.

321
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
It was amazing.

322
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm not just waiting.

323
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
I'm waiting.

324
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
I see.

325
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
That's right.

326
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
I'm not just waiting.

327
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I'm not just waiting.

328
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm not just waiting.

329
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm not just waiting.

330
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
I'm not just waiting.

331
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm not just waiting in the car.

332
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
That's right.

333
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
I know.

334
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Are we done with Ijiri?

335
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes.

336
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,700
Let's go to Ijiri.

337
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Will there be a second car in Ijiri?

338
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
They'll take this road.

339
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
This will be their last car.

340
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
What?

341
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
He's wearing a suit!

342
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Wait.

343
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
That's not a suit!

344
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
That's a suit!

345
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
That was a suit!

346
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
What are you doing?

347
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
You're wearing a suit?

348
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Am I wrong?

349
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
I'm doing the Mario Kart!

350
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh!

351
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,700
Oh!

352
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,200
Mr. Ume!

353
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,700
Hey, you!

354
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, sorry!

355
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
That's...

356
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
That's... Mr. Kiyoshi!

357
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Mr. Romi Yamada!

358
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Mr. Romi Yamada?

359
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh, it's Taka!

360
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Buzz Lightyear!

361
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Who's this?

362
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,700
Oh!

363
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,200
Oh!

364
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
Hoshizawa Sentou!

365
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Wow!

366
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Crazy!

367
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh, you!

368
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
It's Ui!

369
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
It's Ui!

370
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I'm Ui!

371
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
This is the best part!

372
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
I'm Ui!

373
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,700
I'm Ui!

374
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I'm Ui!

375
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I'm Ui!

376
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm Ui!

377
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm Ui!

378
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
I'm Ui!

379
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I'm Ui!

380
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm Ui!

381
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
Crazy!

382
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Tooooooooot!

383
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,220
That was funny!

384
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,680
I've got to say, that means,

385
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
this is our first time meeting them.

386
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,360
But the fact that they know us much...

387
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
They really trip me up.

388
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Well, you know...

389
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,200
Well, well, well, you know...

390
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,700
I was a bit surprised the other day.

391
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,200
What?

392
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
It's scary.

393
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,700
You know...

394
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,200
Whoa!

395
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
You're old! You haven't said it yet!

396
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,700
That's also old.

397
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,700
The other day, I was shopping in Shinjuku.

398
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,200
You know, I was shopping in Shinjuku and parked my car there.

399
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
When I came back from shopping, you know...

400
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,700
Well, it's a prank, right?

401
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,200
Glass...

402
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,700
Huh?

403
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,200
Beware of broken things?

404
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,700
Huh?

405
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,200
Glass?

406
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
You don't need to know.

407
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
You're the only one who doesn't know.

408
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
There's something like that!

409
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's like sticking a sticker on a cardboard.

410
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
It's like being careful of broken things.

411
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
You know?

412
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
After I finished shopping, I got in the car and started the engine.

413
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,200
There was a guy who was sticking a sticker on the front glass.

414
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I couldn't do anything about it.

415
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I opened the window and took it off.

416
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I threw it away.

417
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I went like this.

418
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Then I went from Shinjuku all the way to Sasazuka.

419
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I had a cup of tea in Sasazuka.

420
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Then I came out again.

421
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
It was stuck on the front glass again!

422
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
It was stuck on the front glass again!

423
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,200
It was stuck on the front glass again!

424
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
You were stuck on it.

425
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I was stuck on it!

426
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Where is it? Where is it?

427
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
It was scary!

428
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I came from Shinjuku to Sasazuka in a hurry.

429
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
It was creepy.

430
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I took it off from the front glass.

431
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
What is it?

432
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I was worried about the back glass.

433
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I went to the parking lot.

434
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I saw it and it was stuck on the bottom.

435
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What is it?

436
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I thought I didn't know.

437
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
It was completely stuck.

438
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I went home.

439
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I took it off.

440
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I put it on the bed.

441
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I noticed it.

442
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I think the three were stuck together.

443
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
You didn't notice it at first, did you?

444
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,200
That's right.

445
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I couldn't see it at all.

446
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,200
I was running away.

447
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,200
I thought I was being chased by something.

448
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
It's not scary.

449
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
You are scary.

450
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't think I'm smart.

451
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
What is it?

452
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
It's a blind spot.

453
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
You didn't notice it.

454
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:43,200
For example, a girl I was dating at the time left her toothbrush.

455
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
My toothbrush and the girl's toothbrush.

456
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
You left it.

457
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I left it.

458
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I replied immediately.

459
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,200
You sometimes invite other girls to your house.

460
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
That's right.

461
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,200
At that time, you hide the girl's toothbrush.

462
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
That's right.

463
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,200
But sometimes you forget to hide it.

464
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I see.

465
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
When the girl comes, you say, that's my toothbrush.

466
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
That's right.

467
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I don't know what to do with this.

468
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
It's a trick of Machan.

469
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
I see.

470
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Why do you say that?

471
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I hide my toothbrush.

472
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I don't have to hide her toothbrush.

473
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
If I have a toothbrush, I can hide it.

474
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,200
When I hide my toothbrush, I know it's hidden.

475
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,200
This is amazing.

476
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,200
It's amazing, but you can't get out of it again.

477
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
That's right.

478
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I have a lot of tricks.

479
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,200
One time, a woman hit me.

480
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Someone came to my house.

481
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Someone came to my house.

482
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
The woman said, no one came.

483
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I said, I know.

484
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I said, it's okay.

485
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I know.

486
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,200
There is a point that only one person can understand.

487
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I did everything.

488
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I saw it from the side.

489
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I don't know what to do.

490
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I said, I don't know.

491
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I can't tell you because it will happen in the future.

492
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I thought about it after the show.

493
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
There was nothing.

494
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
That's right.

495
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,200
That's what I did.

496
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,200
You look like a woman today.

497
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
You don't want anyone.

498
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,200
You're sweating a lot today.

499
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
That's strange.

500
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
What are you talking about?

501
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,200
What are you talking about?

502
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:35,200
When you see someone who is about to lose to the cold of winter, you hug them and make them warm.

503
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
It's a long story, but I understand.

504
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Where can you get the black sand in the sky state circuit?

505
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
There is such a place.

506
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Where is it?

507
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,200
It's in Stockholm.

508
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,200
There is such a place.

509
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Was it better in Japan?

510
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I don't know if it was better or not.

511
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Let's ask a little further.

512
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
It's in Stockholm.

513
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
One side is like that.

514
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
It's like Tottori Sakyu.

515
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Tottori Sakyu.

516
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Next is Tottori Sakyu.

517
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
It's a little like Maki-ji.

518
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Tottori Sakyu.

519
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
It's Tottori Sakyu.

520
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
It's like that.

521
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
It's a place to take pictures.

522
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
It's a place to take pictures.

523
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,200
They don't know anything about the sand when they see it.

524
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
They don't shake it.

525
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Do you understand?

526
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I understand.

527
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,200
There was a high school baseball tournament in Stockholm.

528
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm starting to understand.

529
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Tottori Higashi High School.

530
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Tottori?

531
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,200
There was a high school baseball tournament in Stockholm.

532
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
It was a championship high school.

533
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
I see.

534
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,200
After all, Tottori High School was better, wasn't it?

535
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
I lost.

536
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I wanted to take it home.

537
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I put it in a bag.

538
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I took it home.

539
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,200
At that time, I said, wait a minute.

540
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Did you shake it?

541
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I want to shake it.

542
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm not the only one. Everyone knows.

543
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
I know that.

544
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,200
It's not a joke.

545
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm the minus point.

546
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Why is that a minus point?

547
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
What is it?

548
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Tell me.

549
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,200
I took it off.

550
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I thought it was warm.

551
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
What's wrong with that?

552
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,200
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has been involved in the naming of new products in various industries.

553
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Are you stupid?

554
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Aren't you involved?

555
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
I was involved.

556
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
That's right.

557
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:19,200
What are the new products?

558
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
There are many.

559
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Did you do this?

560
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
This naming.

561
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Yes.

562
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Please tell me what kind of product it is.

563
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
This is rotten.

564
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
When I opened it, it was rotten.

565
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,200
It doesn't sell well.

566
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,200
But how is it at the convenience store?

567
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Fluffy.

568
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,200
I don't care about the current situation.

569
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm worried about the current situation.

570
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
It's fluffy.

571
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I don't care about the current situation.

572
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,200
It's a shelf that doesn't sell well.

573
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
That's right.

574
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
It's a product.

575
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Do you know what's in there?

576
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
I know.

577
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Why are you selling a glove with a puff?

578
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I don't need it.

579
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Who buys it?

580
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I can't buy it.

581
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
I have never given money to anyone.

582
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You are a person who buys.

583
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
What?

584
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Please tell me what kind of product it is.

585
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
It's rotten.

586
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200

I know.

594
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200

I know.

596
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
It's a mix of Okonomiyaki.

597
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200

If you have it, you buy it.

602
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
If you don't have it, you buy it.

603
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
It depends on what's rotten.

604
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Raw fish.

605
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
You don't have to say that.

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
It's rotten.

607
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,200

It's interesting.

613

It doesn't sell well.

614
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
There are many other products.
