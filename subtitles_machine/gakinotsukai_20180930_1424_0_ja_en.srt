1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A 24 hour long interview that was close to Nadal's human nature

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And then Nadal

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm not that funny

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I don't like it

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't like it

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And as a result of searching for the truth

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
My Heipo is a different type of person

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know if I can do it

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm a man

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And so, the punishment game is decided

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first time, the one who doesn't know how to use the instrument

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The punishment game is the world's Heipo and man

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Daru-chan

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's out!

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's out!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What kind of comedians meet that often?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's only been 2 years.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's just been 2 years.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why is it a punishment game?

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a little bit of a lie.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a little bit of a lie.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why am I going to the punishment game with you?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's not related to punishment.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because there's no one who acted deliciously with you.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a punishment.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The harsh, harsh, and harsh punishment game is about to begin.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's so hot.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Good morning.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good morning.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today, we're going to have a 24 hour long punishment game.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Punishment game?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Punishment game?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's like a punishment game.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a lie.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Because, it's been announced that you will be going on a trip with Heipo in a punishment game.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I should have said it in advance.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please stop it.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a lie.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Heipo is going on a journey in pair-suits.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I see.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're going to the punishment game today, right?

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You did something bad, right?

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, I didn't do anything bad.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You did!

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No, I didn't.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm scared.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A heavy-duty director who has been in the show since the beginning of 1989.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's so thin.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's not a demon, but he's extremely scary.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sometimes, he says,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What a ridiculous story!

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And sometimes, he says things that are out of the ordinary.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He has a personality full of problems, but he has never been married, and he has been married 63 times this year.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is this your first time with Heipou?

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No, this is my first time with him.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've seen him on TV.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He's a very open person, but he's also very selfish.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We met in Yoshimoto, right?

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, in Yoshimoto.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't remember?

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
At the theater.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, at the office.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sorry.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's like a useless relationship.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The punishment game.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
World peace and two men traveling.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The rules of the trip are to perform the commands that are given to you in different places, so that you don't get any bad parts.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In any case, make it a fun trip full of smiles.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The first command is this.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Immediately, the first command is announced.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Command?

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Command?

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's the opposite.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Find each other's humanity through private conversation.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
While you are talking to each other, please understand each other's personality.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In that car over there.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The private conversation is inside the moving car.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wait a minute.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a little too frivolous.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No, it's too frivolous for me.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you go with this?

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you go with two people?

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I drive with two people.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's go with everyone.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Nadori touches the cage, rents a car and goes on a trip with the soldiers.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This compact Jimny is his favorite.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Even though it's a punishment game, if he can have fun on the trip, it might help Nadal improve his image.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The two of them are finally starting their journey. What kind of journey will it be?

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I've never done a marriage with Aiko-san.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've been doing it with Ayako-san in Michigan.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's been a while since we met.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
After the show, I met him by chance at Asakusa 10th.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was a little...

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Did you have sex?

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, no, no, I didn't.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There was a scary looking guy behind me.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I said, don't pose!

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You used to play with him, didn't you?

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I used to play with him.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was a girl-lover.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There were times when I hated even humans.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You are being made to do that.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are the one who gives the orders.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have been doing bad things recently.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But when I do bad things, I don't enjoy it when I don't have any fun.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You don't enjoy it?

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't enjoy it. So it's better to throw away the orders.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When everyone is gathering, I get bigger.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't get bigger.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You don't get bigger?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, so the tits are bigger than you.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not that it's bigger than my tits.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So the tits are bigger than you.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's because my tits are bigger than my tits.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, that's how it is.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's why it's fun.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, that's why I'm a man.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's why I'm half-life when I was young.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think the Shimonota Talk is over.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sure there are a lot of people coming.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, I don't think so.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't get 15,000 yen on TV.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought you could get 100,000 yen.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't get it.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm an actor. I'm doing my best.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I just want to act.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't have money to buy a ticket.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't have money.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm going to throw up.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm a little shocked.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I thought I was laughing more

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
While talking about this, we came to Mother Farm

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The mission here is to have fun with animals

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The two of them are in a special vehicle to visit the farm and experience feeding

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Nadal, who likes animals, is very active

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ah, scary!

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't want to give it to you! Take it yourself!

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Stop it!

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Take it!

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll leave it here and say, eat it!

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Eat it!

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This time, the main character is just a ghost.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Heipo doesn't care about the body, but shows the presence of the main character's body.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait, wait, this side too!

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ah, scary!

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
NADARU is in a good mood.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you okay?

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not okay!

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Here, here, here.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This guy is scary!

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Ahhhh!

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Here, here, here.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Ahhhh!

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, no, no.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's so scary about this?

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What are you eating?

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm telling you the reason why I'm scared.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're cute, NADARU.

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ahhhh! You're not cute!

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It is hard to say that Nadal had contact with animals in the past.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Seeing this, Nadal gradually changed.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The next command is...

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's over, isn't it?

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Spend the night at the campsite.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I can't do that.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Everyone should go camping.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It won't end.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I said I would start at 7 o'clock tomorrow.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I will start at 7 o'clock tomorrow.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm really looking forward to Takahashi-san's summer live concert

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can just pass it

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't do it

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In the car on the way

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I can't pass it

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Takahashi-san is really worried and he's practicing a lot

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Everyone is really worried

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What is that?

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What is that?

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's telling his seniors that he's dissing them

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
To be honest, I'm the type of person who doesn't say much

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Who says that?

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can't believe you're selling your senior.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's okay.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Poor guy.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Mr. Diane and...

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What about Diane?

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mr. Yamauchi from Kamaitachi.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry, but I'll have you pay for this.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll pay for this.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't pay for this.

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can't pay for this.

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Waiting for the sun to set,

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the two are taken to the campsite,

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
which is far from the crowd.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Are you okay?

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't want to.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't want to.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I've seen you so many times.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't want to.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You've seen me so many times.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Please take a picture of your faces.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We'll take a picture of our faces.

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Can we turn our faces this way?

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hey, it's scary.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's so scary.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Please, I beg you.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's pitch black.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's scary.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Hei Po show has begun.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't want to do this.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What should I do?

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What are you doing?

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please wait, Seibo-san.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
From here on, there are only a few cameramen left on the set.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Many staffs are watching from far away

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's go inside

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm scared

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm really bad at this

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not good at this either

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No way

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have to take off my shoes

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's slippery

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm surprised

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't scare me

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What is written here?

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a medical session

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There are many bugs in summer

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You will spend some time in this tent with Nadar and Heipo.

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When the alarm goes off, open the envelope with the map.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Go to the marked spot.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Since there are cameras on the spot, stand in line and take a commemorative photo.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Wait...

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ah!

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't scare me! What's wrong?

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So even Navarre can't do it?

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's no good.

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's the worst of typhoons.

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The first time he was able to get a job

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
After an hour, he regained his composure and started to worry about his job

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We've never filmed a regular program in Tokyo

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, you've never filmed a regular program?

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If I could count the morning, I would have a job every day

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's amazing that you go out every day

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So you're that Kato-san, right?

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're called a mad dog.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's right. But I'm still a mad dog.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're a mad dog?

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm a mad dog.

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We were together before, when I was working.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If I'm a little silly, I'm a strong puncher.

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, you're a strong puncher.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm a little weaker.

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You look so strong, I don't want to see you, Hamada.

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What do you mean?

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're already weak.

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No, that's not it.

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No, that's not it.

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Like Hoshi.

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The real view is that you have to get a little older.

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's just the beginning.

267
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My heart is beating so fast. What should I do? Should I stop?

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay, okay.

269
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What? It stopped.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It stopped?

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll open the lid.

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're going to open the lid?

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What's with this Japanese poem?

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Make it a copy of the A4 paper.

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's go to Hokora and take a series of photos.

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You don't want to go to a place like that, right?

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't want to go.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hokora, Hokora.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They are aiming for the treasure map for the memorial shooting.

280
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You are always complaining.

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's dark.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm scared.

283
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mr. Heibo.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wait, Dan.

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm supporting you from behind.

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm getting older and I'm even more scared.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm scared every time you touch me.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I got it!

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm doing my best to avoid it.

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I see.

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Tei-bou, you're doing it quietly.

292
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The water is ringing.

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What?

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What?

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's ringing.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Something is coming out.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It looks like a monster.

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm scared of trees.

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm scared of trees.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I want to go to the boar zoo.

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Seriously?

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The boar is really scary.

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a matter of life.

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But you can sleep.

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What is this?

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What is this?

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What is this?

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What is this?

310
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm scared.

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What is this?

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Huh? What is this?

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, no, no!

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm scared, get out of here!

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What is this?

317
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't know!

318
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What is this?

319
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hei-Po-San, it's a tree!

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Tree!

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's a tree!

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's scary about it?

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I hate trees.

324
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you are afraid of trees, it's full of them around here.

325
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a tree!

326
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a hat!

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Heipo-san, you're really tired yourself.

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Yes.

329
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm also tired of Heipo-san.

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
It's my punishment game, but it's Nadara-kun's punishment game.

331
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Let's stop complaining.

332
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
What's with these footprints?

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The position is...

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The point is...

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But I'm a little scared, so I'm scared if I don't do it to you.

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,500
Let's do it to you.

337
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
It's Nadara-kun's fault.

338
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
What are you doing?

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Don't say that.

340
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I don't know.

341
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You don't know?

342
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Ah, I'm so angry.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're so big.

344
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,000
The two of them are in front of the shrine.

345
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm really scared of the tree.

346
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's only a tree.

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's a big tree.

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Typhoon! Typhoon!

349
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Heiba-san, it's a tree.

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please forgive me.

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It took a long time, but they completed the order and returned to the tent safely.

352
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm tired.

353
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm tired.

354
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There's a crow.

355
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Heiba-san, let's stop saying normal things.

356
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go to the forest.

357
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There are also trees in the forest.

358
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There are also trees in the forest.

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's right.

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm scared of trees.

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm going to the forest.

362
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There is an uneasy atmosphere in the tent.

363
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At such times, the two people are filled with vulgar stories.

364
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I've been dating, so I've never had a good time.

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I thought I'd be a celebrity.

366
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you a celebrity?

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You were so popular in the past.

368
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Who?

369
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Laura.

370
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Wow, you're going to a great place.

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And Manami Hashimoto.

372
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, not her.

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But at that time, I thought it was a dream to win the King of Contest.

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But it wasn't.

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I wanted to see what it was like.

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What do you mean?

377
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't want to say it, but...

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I want to see it.

379
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I want to see it too

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What a stupid story

381
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The next order is to take a photo at the cemetery

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The director will be happy if I do it

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What did I do?

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What did I do wrong?

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I didn't do anything

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I did my best for 24 hours

387
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Meanwhile, the next order is

388
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why are you sweating so much?

389
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ah, I got it!

390
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Pull it!

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm pulling it!

392
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Ah, I got it!

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm pulling it!

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Why can't I eat this?

395
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Let's go over there

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's a red one!

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I want you to forgive me

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Look at the back

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is not something to laugh at.

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No one is laughing.

401
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No one is laughing.

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Wow, look.

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a red one.

404
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I saw it just now.

405
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Where are you going?

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's go.

407
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Are you still going?

408
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait, there's something.

409
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's a red one, over here.

410
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What is this? Red?

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's a pet bottle.

412
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's calm down.

413
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you look at it, it's a pet bottle in an instant.

414
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The two finished the commemorative photo shoot in a short time.

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's so excited that he's going to the tent

416
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
How much did I fly?

417
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's angry

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know, please forgive me

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Please forgive him

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's a crow!

421
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What is this?

422
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm not going to do it.

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I couldn't do it!

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm so sorry.

425
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't see it coming.

426
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You have to do it.

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please, please.

428
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I can't do it because no one said OK.

429
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How many years have you been doing this?

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm begging you!

431
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's not expected that Heipo will start to talk.

432
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
As usual, the location has ended.

433
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But tonight, it's not over yet.

434
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The tent life continues after Heipo has started to talk.

435
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What do you want to do?

436
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You guys are doing it so well!

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Can I take a break?

438
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm really doing my best!

439
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Let's take a break.

440
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm a good director.

441
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is amazing. How many times do I have to do this?

442
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's more than last time.

443
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You guys are so annoying.

444
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,960
The

445
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,360
truth is, I heard that you were popular, Mr. Heibon.

446
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,400
It's a long time ago.

447
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
How many times did you do that?

448
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,200
No, I don't really know because it's a wind-up.

449
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,560
How many times did you put wind-up?

450
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,360
There is a wind-up of 5 times.

451
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
I don't know.

452
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
But the wind-up is 5 times.

453
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,440
Well, that's right.

454
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
No matter how many people are there.

455
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm not talking about that, but I'm not having fun.

456
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's stop the pre-recording.

457
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Everyone, hurry up and become 63 years old!

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You'll know when you're old.

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't want to do it again.

460
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I've been holding my teeth for a long time.

461
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't go on like this until the alarm goes off.

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mr. Heipo is saying it's hard.

463
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm going, so let the alarm go off!

464
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm not going.

465
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm not going either.

466
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm not going either.

467
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Ahhhh!

468
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Ouch!

469
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Ouch!

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The next order is a memorial photo at the ruins.

471
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Someone please say something like,

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Good work!

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Is there anyone who doesn't get a good score?

474
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's just an S.

475
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
S is not a good director.

476
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's not that kind of director.

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I thought S was a good director.

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let's go to the special number.

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Who taught you that?

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Shut up!

481
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a mess.

482
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Ah! It moved!

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It moved!

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It moved!

485
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's really energetic.

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I can't do it anymore.

487
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Just like before,

488
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
he arrived at the abandoned house,

489
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
afraid of the shaking tree.

490
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What are you doing?

491
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What are you doing?

492
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's just get out of here.

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The only thing they want to do is to take a commemorative photo.

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Here is the only scary story tonight.

495
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I wonder if it's okay.

496
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's nothing.

497
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's scary.

498
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a secret.

499
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Scary.

500
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll kill you.

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Wait! Wait! Wait!

502
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Wait!

503
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Ah! The spider's web!

504
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Let's end this!

505
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Every time they smile,

506
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Nadal and Keiko set out with such a goal.

507
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The first two people think of each other as a joke.

508
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
On the way, they ate together.

509
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's disgusting!

510
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
They didn't care about the way they ate.

511
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Because they were similar.

512
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
However, when they met animals, their relationship became broken.

513
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
At night camp, the two completely lost their smiles.

514
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
At least at the end of the trip, they will smile.

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm so sorry.

516
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm so sorry.

517
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
At least the last part of the trip is a smile.

518
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Where is this?

519
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm so sorry.

520
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What are you doing?

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You're so mean.

524
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What's going on?

526
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Help me!

527
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Are you going to win?

528
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Are you going to win?

529
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So this time it was like this.

530
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Is it okay?

531
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That's right.

532
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What the hell is that?

533
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What the hell is it?

534
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's too funny.

535
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I saw the second part.

536
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What's the punishment?

537
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Well then, you two, see you in the second part!

538
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Thank you very much.

539
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's really hard.

540
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm nervous.
