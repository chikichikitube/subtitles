1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I can't do it because I'm a kid!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I can't do it because I'm a kid!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Search for the correct answer in the shopping district!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is a team from Shibuya.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm scared.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can't do it, I can't do it.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm going to walk over there.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There are shops on both sides of the shopping district.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Each person will make a mistake one by one.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
One person will search for it.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Each person will make a mistake one by one.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First of all, there should be no mistakes.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to walk all the way over there.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm scared.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm scared.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm scared.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to ask you to guess how different it is from before.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There are two choices.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want you to guess correctly.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What are you doing?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm asking you how it's different from before.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What is this?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There's one more.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's one more?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There's one more.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What is this?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What is this?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What is this?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is a new work from this fall.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're lying!

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is this?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm walking with a pig!

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is different!

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right!

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's getting cooler, isn't it?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's cold, isn't it?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you wearing red?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's correct!

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll give you a hint.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The person...

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The person...

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's normal.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How is it?

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's go with the correct answer.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please come out.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This lady is the scarecrow.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The first one I saw was the lady over there.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't you get it?

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This time, I set it up.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll go right away.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
My Hamachan?

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is my Hamachan?

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What is this?

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have to look carefully.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's hard!

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's hard!

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This person is Yuji Hirano.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
As an extra, I have one more thing.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's a real man.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He's the best in his field.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's wrong?

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What kind of person is this?

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's normal, isn't it?

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's not normal.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's hard!

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's amazing.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's hard to say something like this.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Welcome, welcome.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Welcome, welcome.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Welcome, welcome.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where are you from?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm from Eihime.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's interesting.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Did you fall down?

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I fell down. I fell down somewhere.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This old lady.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's been a long time.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's been a long time.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The set has changed.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The set has changed.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's new.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The design is still the same.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's Hibino's design.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's still the same.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's amazing that the set has poop.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What should we talk about?

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What should we talk about?

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There were a lot of things this time.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The most memorable thing was...

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was embarrassed.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There's a time when I was tired and sleeping on the Shinkansen.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was really tired.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was dreaming while sleeping.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I was dreaming.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was dreaming when I was in elementary school.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You had a great dream.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I was dreaming while sleeping.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My brother was sleeping next to me.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I felt like I was going to faint.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Who?

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Me.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I felt like I was going to faint.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I fainted in front of my brother.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In front of your brother.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
When I woke up, it was really peaceful.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You were on the Shinkansen at that time.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was the only one who felt peaceful.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When I passed through the room, I woke up.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was surprised.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I thought it was the Shinkansen.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I looked to the side and I was sitting next to it.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was surprised.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I thought I was going to faint.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The person next to me laughed at me.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I thought it was uncool.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Was the sound loud?

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was loud.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I woke up by myself.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You woke up by your own sound?

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I woke up by my own sound.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It was loud.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I woke up by my own sound.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You woke up by your own sound?

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I woke up by my own sound.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I woke up by my own sound when I was dreaming.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I woke up by my own sound when I was sleeping.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why?

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you sick?

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I woke up by my own sound.

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Is that right?

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I woke up by my own sound.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think it's embarrassing to wake up by your own sound.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Women should wake up by their own sound.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why?

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Women have a lot of constipation.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They can't poop.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So they wake up by their own sound.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is that so?

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They have been doing this for a long time.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They are very depressed.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I do it three or four times a day.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You do it more.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You do it more.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I really do it.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You do it more.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I really do it.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I told you before.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How many times do you do it?

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
About two hamsters.

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't say it's easy to understand.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You are such an idiot.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know how many times you do it.

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why can't you do it at once?

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's true.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can poop whenever I want.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can poop whenever I want.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Bring me a newspaper.

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Here it is.

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can do it.

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's true.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will stab you.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can do it.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can control the number of times and the amount.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can control it.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can poop as much as that.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can poop as much as that.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's too much.

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can poop in the same shape and color as that.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can poop as much as that.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can poop as much as that.

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can do it by turning your waist.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can do it.

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I wonder if you can do it.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's difficult to do it at the end.

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can do it.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can't do it.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can do it.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Have you ever done it?

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I have.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
At home?

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You poop at home.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You poop like this?

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can do it.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can poop in a round place like a cake.

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can do it.

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I can't write congratulations.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Who are you congratulating?

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You just poop at my house.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who are you congratulating?

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can do it.

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't you have any special skills?

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
People can't do this.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't have any special skills.

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Can you do this?

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can do it.

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are a girl.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm a man.

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can't do it.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You can't do it.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can't do it if you turn your waist more.

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can do it.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What do you do when you poop?

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You have to be careful not to poop.

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But you can't do it here.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
In the last special edition of Shobai Shobai,

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yoshiko Nakada was next to me.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You pooped at first, didn't you?

217
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I thought it was dangerous, so I pooped.

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But your face was like this.

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was laughing at the beginning.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But when I came to the back, Yoshiko Nakada was next to me again.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I pooped at that time.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I thought it was rude, so I pooped.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So I pooped here.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I pooped again, and I pooped again.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please forgive me.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You haven't pooped a lot, have you?

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's right.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've never been pooped in front of me.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Everyone is a little too cool.

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think you should be a little more calm.

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm showing my shame.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Really?

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm fine.

235
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Really?

236
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What kind of shame did you show?

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
When I went to the hospital,

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the doctor gave me a big finger on my butt.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When I said my intestines were strange,

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
he gave me a big finger and raised my leg.

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He gave me a big finger.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You were so happy.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're a fool.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't go to the hospital at all.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Everyone was happy when I said,

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Give me a big finger.

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will never do that again.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was so embarrassed.

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I thought it was a rude doctor.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's my job.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When I pooped, my face turned red.

252
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really?

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Did you poop face-to-face?

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I went to bed.

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My pants were shifted.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It was like this.

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The pen name is a long-necked person.

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I love it.

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's amazing.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Good evening.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have a question.

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What is Chanchara Okashi's Chanchara?

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're good at that.

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't you know that?

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know that.

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's famous.

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Chanchara Okashi.

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's famous.

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know.

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What is Chanchara?

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is a long time ago.

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's a comic book.

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's called Chanchara.

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
By the way, Chanchara.

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This comic book is so funny.

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
When was that?

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
When I was still in the gym.

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
When I was still in the gym,

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
there was a comic book called Chanchara.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's so funny now.

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know about that.

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Chanchara is really funny.

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Chanchara Okashi is funny.

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're as funny as Chanchara.

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm convinced.

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is that so?

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If there's anything I don't know,

288
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll tell you.

289
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What are you doing now?

290
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm drawing a lot now.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Drawing a lot?

292
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're still alive?

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm still alive.

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Really?

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How old are you?

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm about 98 years old now.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're both alive?

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes, I'm both alive.

299
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I'm doing well now.

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're doing well at 98?

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm doing well.

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Chanchara is quite expensive.

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Chanchara is quite expensive.

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll invite you as a guest.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Really?

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's quite expensive.

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What kind of comic book did you do at that time?

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Chanchara.

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hello, Chanchara.

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's wrong, Chara?

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's hot, isn't it?

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

314
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's hot.

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes.

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I knew it.

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's hot, isn't it?

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What are you saying?

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I see.

321
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When I was driving with my girlfriend,

322
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
we were at the pedestrian bridge.

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
When I was reading the quote,

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the courage that doesn't give you the speed to be safe,

325
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I bumped into the car in front of me and got into an accident.

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why is that quote written so that the driver can read it?

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you have anything to think about in the middle of the night,

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
please let me know.

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's what I think.

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There's a long sign, isn't it?

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I want you to read it, so I put it up.

332
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But if you read it, it's dangerous, isn't it?

333
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But what is that?

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's not that close, is it?

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, yes.

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's self-defeating.

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There was a lot of traffic on the road.

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was a little jammed, so I looked away.

339
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
When I saw it, I bumped into it.

340
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Is there such a thing usually?

341
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, there are a lot of contradictions.

342
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Even on a bicycle.

343
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's a thing that glows on the saddle of a bicycle.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Is that so?

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In a dark place because it's dangerous.

346
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
At night?

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, at night.

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
When I ran, it was shining.

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There was a car.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What's that?

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's shining.

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's go.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't go.

354
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There may be times when I pull it out.

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There may be such a thing.

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There are contradictions, aren't there?

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Such a thing.

358
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is no such thing.

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, the world is full of contradictions.

360
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What is full of contradictions?

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There are a lot.

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Tell me, if there are a lot.

363
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There are two hundred and five.

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then, today is the fifth of that number.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There are five.

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
For example, this button of yours.

367
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is strange.

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't need it.

369
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
First one.

370
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Second one.

371
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This microphone.

372
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's strange.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Second one.

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Third one.

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This skin.

376
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's all about me, isn't it?

377
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Such a thing.

378
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There are contradictions.

379
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's why I'm telling you to listen to that.

380
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm angry.

381
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm angry about that.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What?

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The road sign is also the same.

384
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The sign.

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

386
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For example?

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That.

388
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a pun.

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I see.

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, stop.

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That kind of thing.

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Stop?

393
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Who are you talking to?

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What does it say?

395
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Please stop.

396
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If it's not that, what are you talking to people?

397
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It doesn't matter.

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's strange.

399
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Stop and get angry.

400
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're angry.

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't you get angry?

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If you're told to stop.

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It doesn't matter.

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm the most angry.

405
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm going to say it on TV.

406
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I will never stop in front of the crossing.

407
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's okay to broadcast this.

408
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I will never do this.

409
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What did you say?

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Who are you talking to?

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I will never do this.

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It doesn't make sense.

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why?

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I will never stop in front of the crossing.

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a confirmation.

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Confirm what?

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That the train is not coming.

418
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's not coming.

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not closed.

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's right.

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But maybe.

422
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What?

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Maybe.

424
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes.

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know if it's a mistake.

426
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't know if it's coming from the other side.

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You can tell by the sound.

428
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not stupid.

429
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I can tell if the train is coming.

430
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No.

431
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's why.

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I know now.

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I know that you have to stop early.

434
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's not good if you stop.

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If you do, you have to go.

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you do, you can't stop.

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's why I don't recognize the train.

438
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The car is lined up at the crossing.

439
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
At the crossing.

440
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When the train finally came.

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Only about 5 people are on it.

442
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What for?

443
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't think they wait that long.

444
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's strange.

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's why I won't stop if you push me. I'll just keep going.

446
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Is that so?

447
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, yes.

448
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Even if I get hit by a train, I won't die, right?

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Eh?

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No, even if I get hit by a train, I won't die.

451
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
For real.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll write a letter and say, for real.

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, for real.

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No, you see...

455
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You've never been hit, right?

456
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm not a guy.

457
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm not a guy, I'm a guy.

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's enough.

459
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I love you, Hama-chan.

460
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thank you very much.

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm going to go get some sweets for my head.

462
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The other day, when I was reading Men's Nonno,

463
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hama-chan was chosen as the 2nd best-looking man in the world.

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Ah, really?

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
By the way, the 1st place was Yoshida Eizaku, and the 3rd place was Tawara Toshihiko.

466
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you think about this result?

467
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hama-chan, you're certainly swinging your hips on TV, so please answer.

468
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Please?

469
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's completely wrong.

470
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Is that so?

471
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

472
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's completely wrong.

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're a woman.

474
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
For me, you're a chick.

475
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I can't do it at all.

476
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
First, just with your fingers...

477
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Stop it.

478
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And then, you use my tools.

479
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I wrote it as 〇〇〇 and read it as 〇〇〇.

480
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Hama-chan, 〇〇〇 is 〇〇〇.

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're such a troublemaker.

482
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's go home.

483
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's so hot.

484
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The other day, when I was riding the Shinkansen,

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was riding alone.

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There were a lot of people.

487
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
When there were a lot of people,

488
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
when I was riding from Shin-Osaka, my fan...

489
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There was nothing there.

490
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He was just a fan.

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He came in like this on the Shinkansen.

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He handed me a letter.

493
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hama-chan, why didn't you call me?

494
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey, call me.

495
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He's angry.

496
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He's angry.

497
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He's scared.

498
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The people around him were like,

499
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey, there's Matsumoto.

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There's Matsumoto.

501
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The people around him were like, Hey, there's Matsumoto.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's Matsumoto.

503
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So the girl wrote in the letter.

504
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
She wrote it.

505
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Please call me.

506
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll ignore it.

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll ignore it.

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why don't you do it?

509
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll ignore it.

510
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So why don't you do it?

511
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know, but I won't do it.

512
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't make fun of me.

513
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Ignore it.

514
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I won't.

515
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I won't do it either.

516
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You do it sometimes.

517
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I won't do it either.

518
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I won't do it either.

519
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I won't do it either.

520
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Sorry.

521
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So,

522
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
How's your time?

523
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's fine.

524
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's go back to the basics next week.

525
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What's that?

526
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Time limit?

527
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You just shot it.

528
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There's a show called Yoshimoto's natural stupidity.

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Actually,

530
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
This is...

531
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You have it, right?

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes.

533
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is me.

534
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Is this me?

535
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's like this.

536
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes.

537
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This is a set of two.

538
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Hudson.

539
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm going to buy a game called Road Runner.

540
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It will come with it.

541
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't care.

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Today is a gift.

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For those who are watching today,

544
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
100 people.

545
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This.

546
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This.

547
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This.

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Please write to me.

549
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm waiting for you.

550
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And also write to me.

551
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You do it as usual.

552
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I do.

553
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Please write to me.

554
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm waiting for you.

555
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm waiting for you.

556
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So,

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I won't do it again.

558
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I won't do it again.

559
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Goodbye.

560
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Wait a minute.
