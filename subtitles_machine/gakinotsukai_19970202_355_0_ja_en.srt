1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Chikichiki, Urekkosakka, Takasu, how do you call them?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,800
I don't know

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Chichihenge

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Chichihenge is the 7th time

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Chichihenge is the 7th time

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There were 7 changes during the meeting

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The one who laughs after seeing them has to pay 1000 yen

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a serious game

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go to the main character

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Please come in

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A childhood friend in downtown

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He is now a popular writer in a variety show

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How much money can he collect?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the past, Isomata was the most

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I did it

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I put Isomata in

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Really?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't know the meaning of putting Isomata in

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
After all, he is an amateur

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He said that he came up with an idea

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because he came up with an idea

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What should we do?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's do skydiving

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Skydiving?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What does it mean?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Skydiving movie

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Skydiving movie

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you want to do it with a girl?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Nakamura Kayosho

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you want to see Kayosho?

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I thought I wanted to see it

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Recently, Isomata is not Okamoto

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Isomata is amazing

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yamazaki still has a task

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There is a task called Mori Man

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is that?

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you can clear that, you may be able to do it again

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's see a new one

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's see if I can do it again

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't feel that I haven't done it before

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a new morning

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can't do it either

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's too long

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's too long

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's impossible for Yamazaki to do it

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Skydiving

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I can't do it

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't do it

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can't do it

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't do it

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can't do it

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can't do it

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't do it

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In a simple place

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's a great name.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
May I?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
May I?

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
My son is here.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
May I take a picture with you?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, no.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Excuse me.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My son is here.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
May I take a picture with you?

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Takeshi!

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who is it?

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't want to see her.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why don't you go?

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why are you silent?

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go away.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why don't you go?

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong with you?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's go.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's go.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Look at me.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't be arrogant.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That doll is funny.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What's that doll?

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's that?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's creepy.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's so real.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you really want to see mine?

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's funny.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's go.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The tea on the right is broken.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Excuse me.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Excuse me.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Excuse me.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, I heard that there are many interesting stories.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I heard that there are many interesting stories.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I heard that there are many interesting stories.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the end of the story.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What are you doing?

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What are you doing?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What are you doing?

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you doing?

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What are you doing?

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you doing?

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What are you doing?

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What are you doing?

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You are getting popular in the second half.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you doing?

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing?

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What are you doing?

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What are you doing?

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you doing?

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,960
I'm tired!

116
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,000
Not tough enough?

117
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,040
I just got tired?!

118
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,160
What are you guys doing here?

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,160
It's hot. It's hot.

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm tired.

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm tired.

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Thank you for your hard work.

123
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
I told you, didn't I?

124
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I told you, didn't I?

125
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,160
How much did you pay?

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
7,000 yen.

127
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
The lowest?

128
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
No, not that much.

129
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,160
The lowest?

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
No way.

131
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Nakamura P. 9,000 yen.

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,160
This is the lowest.

133
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
I'm going to drink tonight.

134
00:08:49,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Drink!

135
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Thank you.

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Today's opening was a little boring.

137
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
It was the same last week.

138
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
This week, too.

139
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
This week's opening is the worst.

140
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
It's the worst.

141
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,160
That's why I have to do my best here.

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
That's not good either.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Why not?

144
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I'll do my best.

145
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
What should I do?

146
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
There's nothing to do.

147
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
There's nothing to do.

148
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,160
There's nothing to do.

149
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
How many years has it been since we started?

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
It's been about seven years.

151
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
About once.

152
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
The silent return home.

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
We're the silent return home?

154
00:09:50,160 --> 00:10:00,160
I think this girl should do her best if she's paying for the ticket season.

155
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
There's nothing to do with this.

156
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
There's nothing to do with the ticket season?

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,160
There's nothing to do with it, but she's paying for it.

158
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
But I'll give you the money.

159
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm just being honest.

160
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
What?

161
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm just being honest.

162
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,160
If I die, will you cry?

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I won't cry.

164
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
You won't cry, will you?

165
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
You haven't done anything.

166
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,160
If you say that, I'll make fun of you.

167
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
But if I die this time, I'll cry.

168
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Why?

169
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Why won't you cry?

170
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Who are you?

171
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Why won't you cry?

172
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Do you know?

173
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Wait a minute. What will happen to you if I die?

174
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
He said that.

175
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
What will happen to you if I die?

176
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
What do you mean, what will happen to you?

177
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
What will happen to you if I die?

178
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I know, I know.

179
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
You're sleeping.

180
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,160
You're sleeping tonight.

181
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Hello?

182
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Hello?

183
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
It's Okamoto.

184
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
What is it?

185
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Masumoto-san just died.

186
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,160
That's not possible.

187
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
That's not possible.

188
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
You have to do it now.

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
That's not possible.

190
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
You'll cry, won't you?

191
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I won't cry.

192
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
You won't cry?

193
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
He just died.

194
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I don't know how to say it.

195
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
He was caught in a container.

196
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Where was he?

197
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Where was he?

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Next to the container.

199
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Why?

200
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
He was next to the container.

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,160
He was caught in the container, so he was next to the container.

202
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,160
But in normal life, there's not much happening next to the container.

203
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
There is such a thing.

204
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
There isn't?

205
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Next to the container, like this.

206
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
What are you doing?

207
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
What is this?

208
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Why is this happening in a container?

209
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
It's a container.

210
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Sorry, what is a container?

211
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
What is a container?

212
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,160
It's like a box made of iron.

213
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
It's a container.

214
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
It's a container.

215
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
What is a container?

216
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Why are you caught in a container?

217
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:19,160
Why are you caught in a container?

218
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I was raised by the Kimijima family.

219
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I graduated from the top fashion school in Paris.

220
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

221
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
What kind of clothes are popular this summer?

222
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
What kind of clothes are popular this summer?

223
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,160
In general, when it comes to fashion,

224
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,160
it's more like Hamada than me.

225
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Actually, it's different.

226
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Well, that's how it is.

227
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Yes, yes.

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
What about you?

229
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,160
What kind of information do you have this summer?

230
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
I don't have any information.

231
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
That's cool.

232
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,160
You don't have any information, but when it comes, it's popular.

233
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It's like the trend is following you.

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Who are you following?

235
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It's like the trend is following you.

236
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Old man!

237
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Let's go to the trend.

238
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
What are you doing?

239
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
The trend is behind you.

240
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Don't be thrown down.

241
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Sorry, sorry.

242
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Please calm down.

243
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
The wind is strong.

244
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
I got it.

245
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
What is it?

248
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
The trend of summer.

249
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Ah, the trend.

250
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
You can see the trend.

251
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Really?

252
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Do you know what was popular last summer?

253
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
What was popular last summer?

254
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
It's Pichi Tea.

255
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Pichi Tea?

256
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
It's definitely Pichi Tea.

257
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
It's not Pichi Tea.

258
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Ah, Chibi Tea.

259
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Laugh! Laugh!

260
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Yes, Chibi Tea was popular.

261
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
This summer...

262
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,160
First of all, the best information.

263
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Yes.

264
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Right?

265
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
The fastest information.

266
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Yes.

267
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
This year...

268
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
This will surprise you.

269
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
What?

270
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
Eh...

271
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Bullets.

272
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
A lot of bullets.

273
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Bullets?

274
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
A bullet?

275
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
A bullet...

276
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I don't know if it's a bullet, but...

277
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
I'll do it like this.

278
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
No way!

279
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
The one with a lot of bullets...

280
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
It's stupid.

281
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Is it stupid?

282
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
It's stupid.

283
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
No matter where you go, it's always like that.

284
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Summer.

285
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
This summer, Matsumoto-san...

286
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
How many bullets are you going to use?

287
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
With bare hands.

288
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Summer.

289
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Ah, is that so?

290
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,160
You have to do it first.

292
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
You have to do it first.

293
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Matsumoto-san, do it.

294
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,160
But if you go to the beach with that, it'll be hot, right?

295
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Go to any bar in the world.

296
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Just by ordering the first one, you'll surprise the people around you.

297
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,160
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who is called the king of first-class menu selection.

298
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
When you go to a super high-end bar,

299
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,160
how do you order the menu so that the people around you won't think it's your first time?

300
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
It's all in one go.

301
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
For example, you know golf, right?

302
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Yes, yes.

303
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
You go to a country club.

304
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Ah, yes, yes.

305
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
You go like this, right?

306
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Country club, yes.

307
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Right?

308
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
You go like this and ring the bell.

309
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
There's probably a bell, right?

310
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Well, there is.

311
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Ring the bell!

312
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I want to go around at 90.

313
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,160
That's up to you.

314
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,160
If you do that, you'll be told to go around at 90.

315
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Depending on what you do, the other person will look down on you.

316
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
That's different.

317
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,160
The bottom is 90 and the top is 120.

318
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Then the other person will be surprised.

319
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
What is that?

320
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
It's the same as when you go hiking.

321
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
The other person will be surprised.

322
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
When I go hiking?

323
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
That's what you did when you went hiking, right?

324
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
What?

325
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Well, at this time of the year, I want to go up from the front of the station.

326
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Yes, yes.

327
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I don't want to show off, but I know that.

328
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Everyone does that.

329
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I'll tell the owner.

330
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
This guy is crazy.

331
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
That's an interesting story.

332
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
I've heard it before.

333
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I'll tell Cathy, of course.

334
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Cathy, too.

335
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
I don't like the eyeballs.

336
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
This guy is crazy.

337
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll tell her.

338
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
This guy is crazy.

339
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
It's the same as when you go to a super high-end bar.

340
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
That's right.

341
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,160
Of course, it's different from the moment you enter the bar.

342
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
It's different from the moment you enter the bar.

343
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
What?

344
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,160
It's different from the moment you enter the bar.

345
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
From the moment you enter the bar?

346
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes.

347
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Hey, hey, hey.

348
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
What should I do?

350
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I don't know.

351
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
I don't know.

352
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
There are two more times.

353
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I'll be waiting.

356
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I'm sorry.

358
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,160
How long will you be alone?

359
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
There's one more.

360
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Oh, man.

361
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I'm really sorry.

362
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm waiting for you.

363
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh no.

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,160
Homemade chance?

365
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Well,

366
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I'll be waiting for you.

367
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
It's a chance to go home.

368
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Well, well, well, well...

369
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
How should I put it?

370
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Like this, right?

371
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Well, like this.

372
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Oh, it's a little slanted?

373
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
It's slanted.

374
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
And, well, put it as low as possible.

375
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
It's not cool at all.

376
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
I really don't know what's going on.

377
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Are you going to show me?

378
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
It's dark.

379
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
What are you talking about?

380
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I don't know what's going on.

381
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Well, as low as possible.

382
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,160
And, well, like this, like this, like this.

383
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
And, well, the menu.

384
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
It's the menu.

385
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Oh, it's light.

386
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
I'm not trying to make you laugh.

387
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
It's a cool order.

388
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Oh, really?

389
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Of course it's an order.

390
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm going to order something.

391
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Oh, do you have wine?

392
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Yes, we do.

393
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
I'll get you some wine.

394
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
What kind of wine is it?

395
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Huh?

396
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
What kind of wine do you have?

397
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Well, I've got everything ready.

398
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Oh, really?

399
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
If you want.

400
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
If you want.

401
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
If you want.

402
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Do you have everything?

403
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Well, I've got everything ready.

404
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
It's red wine, though.

405
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Oh, it's red.

406
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Do you have everything?

407
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Yes, I do.

408
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
What?

409
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Do you really have everything?

410
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Yes, I do.

411
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
I'm in a bad mood.

412
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Why?

413
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
I'm going home.

414
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,160
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who is famous for killing women.

415
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Yes, yes, yes.

416
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Yes, yes, yes.

417
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,160
What's the secret that women come from the other side?

418
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
It's a great question.

419
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
It's a great question.

420
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
What?

421
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,160
This is a little different from the previous questions.

422
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
What?

423
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Matsumoto Makimono.

424
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Matsumoto Makimono.

425
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
That's what I'm talking about.

426
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Right?

427
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I don't know why.

428
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Please introduce it to me.

429
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
How do you get a woman to come to you?

430
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
First of all, move fast.

431
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
There are a lot of them.

432
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, let's press eight.

433
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Yes, eight.

434
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,160
You like to press something, don't you?

435
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Eight.

436
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Eight.

437
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Move fast.

438
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
What does that mean?

439
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Everything moves fast.

440
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Everything moves fast.

441
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Everything moves fast.

442
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Yes, yes, yes.

443
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Everything moves fast.

444
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Everything moves fast.

445
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Move fast.

446
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Yes, yes, yes.

447
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Is that okay?

448
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
First of all, hit this on the head.

449
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I see.

450
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
And draw a circle.

451
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
What does that mean?

452
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,160
For example, there's a microphone over there, right?

453
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Yes, there is.

454
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Please touch that microphone.

455
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Wow, it's an old man.

456
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
It's an old man.

457
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Move your hand forward a little bit.

458
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
You're saying that too much.

459
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
It's an old man.

460
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
It's an old man.

461
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
It's an old man.

462
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,160
It means draw a circle.

463
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
What do you do?

464
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Say it again.

465
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Wow, it's an old man.

466
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
It's a little small.

467
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,160
It's an old man of an electrician.

468
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,160
When you leave the hose at the front door and come to pick it up, the electrician will come.

469
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
When you turn on the air conditioner, the hose will come to the front door.

470
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
That's enough.

471
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,160
That's why I said move fast.

472
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
I'm saying draw a circle.

473
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,160
It's an old man.

474
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
That's why I said what do you do?

475
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Well, it's like what most people are doing now.

476
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
It's an old man.

477
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
There's more.

478
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,160
It means draw a circle.

479
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
It's an old man.

480
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
What is that?

481
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
It means draw a circle.

482
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
It's important to draw a circle.

483
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Is that so?

484
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Is that a circle?

485
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Well...

486
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Is that a circle?

487
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
This is my business talk.

488
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I can't draw a circle when I'm talking about business.

489
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Women have to draw a circle.

490
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
It's different from usual.

491
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
It's very sweet.

492
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Do you usually talk with your voice?

493
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
No, at home.

494
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
At my house.

495
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
At my house?

496
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
And?

497
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
The door is closed.

498
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
What did you say?

499
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
The door is closed.

500
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
What?

501
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
What?

502
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
It's a chain.

503
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
It's a bad news.

504
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
It's a bad news.

505
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
It's a bad news.

506
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
It's going up.

507
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:06,160
It's going up.

508
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Do you want something to drink?

509
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
What?

510
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Do you want something to drink?

511
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Do you want something to drink?

512
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Calpis soda.

513
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Calpis soda.

514
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Are you sick?

515
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Why are you crying?

516
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
It's cold.

517
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
What?

518
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
It's cold.

519
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,160
It's the sun.

520
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Thank you.

521
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,160
This is interesting.

522
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
The hair is long.

523
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
What?

524
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
The hair is long.

525
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
The hair is long.

526
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
It's stretched.

527
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,160
I've come this far recently.

528
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,160
I used to have short hair.

529
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Short hair is good.

530
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
What?

531
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Short hair is good.

532
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Short hair is good.

533
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I wanted to stretch my hair.

534
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,160
What?

535
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,160
What?

536
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:35,160
What?
