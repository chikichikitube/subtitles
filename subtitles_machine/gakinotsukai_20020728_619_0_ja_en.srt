00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
On the 11th of this month, Kokoriko Endo got married after 2 and a half years.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Endo was supposed to have a happy ending, but he had a problem.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I decided to get married on my own.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a good thing, but I thought it was hard.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, that's hard.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I thought there were a lot of people I had to break up with.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know if I can do that.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If it's okay with you today, will you go out with me?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to end it today.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm married and I want you to break up with me.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's personal.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But I don't know what to do by myself.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If possible, I want you to cooperate with me.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Just break up with me?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can I go out with you today?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We can only see each other.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Before that, I'd like to ask you who you are.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't say that.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't want to hear it.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I want you to tell me something that's related to you.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Do you know me?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I know you.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's Mr. Sugasu.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Mr. Sugasu?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mr. Sugasu.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Sugasu.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mr. Sugasu.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't believe it.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll give you some evidence.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You like bikes, don't you?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's take a picture together.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're really fat.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That was the peak.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Last year, we went to the Harleys.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It was hot, so we went to the Tohoku area.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There are a lot of things I have to return today.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
First of all, wetty.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You use it a lot.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You use it a lot.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's oily.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't look at my face.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm 97 years old, so I'm 100 years old.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You guys are funny.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't understand why you guys look like that.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ikko is taken to Sugamatsu TV.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's close.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's close.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What do you want to do?

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If there's something, let's stop it here.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to get married.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We set up Yuino.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Congratulations.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you angry?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm looking at you.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you angry?

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you looking at me?

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm angry.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why are you looking at me?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm married.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Congratulations.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm married, too.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a double disadvantage.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you were dating.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I was dating.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I can't do it anymore.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want you to break up with me.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's one-sided.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to make good memories.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want to make good memories.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's kiss.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I want you to kiss me.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you doing?

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is a company.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you doing?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's stop this.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
End.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I want to make good memories about the past.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
End.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you doing?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You should go.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you want to get off, you can get off.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't do that.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
End.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I broke up with KUSUGA.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What do you mean?

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm still dating.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Still?

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm GIDAYU.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm GREAT GIDAYU.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you doing?

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have a picture.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't want to show this.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
End.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
End.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can't do this.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was surprised.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
After I announced my marriage.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The next day?

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is just a guess.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I did it, so I'll do it, too.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm most afraid of this type.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
After marriage.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have to be clear about that.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
End.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm fine.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't think so.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Everyone.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Good morning.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Good morning.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think you know.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm married.

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Congratulations.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you still waiting?

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was surprised.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
GIDAYU.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What is this?

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This?

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is a guess.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
To whom?

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To me.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
To the portrait.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Wait a minute.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't think it's a guess.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can finally get married.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because it's the next day.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is a little.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wait a minute.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't look at me.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait a minute.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why are you so friendly?

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't you remember?

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
When did you make this?

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You said you made it.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You said you made it.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Until now.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Accept it as reality.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I want to make a wonderful memory.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Finally.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Give me a kiss.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't want a kiss.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Stop it.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Stop it.

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't want a kiss.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stop it.

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to forget about GIDAYU.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want to forget about GIDAYU.

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to forget about GIDAYU.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So I'll give you a kiss.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll give you a kiss.

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Calm down.

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You want to forget about GIDAYU.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No.

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll say no.

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not over yet.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Can I kiss you?

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
With whom?

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Endo.

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's kiss.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you sure?

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you sure?

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sure.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll prepare.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Prepare?

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is there a girl?

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's hard to kiss.

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't feel like it.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll kiss you.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's weird.

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can't do that.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can't do that.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you very much.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's wrap it up.

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We're done with Gidai-U.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What? What do you mean?

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But there's one more person I want to say goodbye to.

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There's more?

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well...

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The next person is...

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Really?

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I think you know him well.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really?

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He was in the same drama as you.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
His name is Kase.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Really?

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why are you naked in the middle of the show?

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is my birthday last year.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm 30 years old.

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was invited to a party in Shinjuku.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Kase invited me to his birthday party.

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The two of us.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It was really delicious.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's good.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll show you today.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We played like this.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's wrong with your body?

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This was the peak.

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're taking too much.

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This was the peak.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There was a time like that.

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is shocking.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There was a photo.

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's something I have to give back to Kase.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is what it looks like.

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Taishu?

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's a Kase.

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I used Kase a lot.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's a long name.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Taishu is longer.

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I bought it at the same time.

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Kase.

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Kase was on my side.

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't think he's wearing it.

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He's not a loser in time.

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think he's wearing it.

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's the one that comes five minutes before.

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
As expected.

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
As expected.

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There's a Kase.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There's a Kase.

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's a man.

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Congratulations.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you.

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I want to make it clear today.

252
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
With Taishu.

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I want you to break up.

254
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're cool.

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What is it?

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's go with the usual Taishu.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's go with the usual Taishu.

258
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Taishu.

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Where is it?

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where is it?

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Taishu doesn't have a scooter.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Taishu doesn't have a scooter.

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think you'll understand if you see this.

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Taishu.

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hard play.

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you.

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why did you write my name?

268
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Taishu wrote it.

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Taishu wrote it.

270
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Taishu.

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Kima was bullying me with this Kase.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kima was bullying me with this Kase.

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't know this.

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know this.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Motosu.

281
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Look at me like a bad guy.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look at me like a bad guy.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know.

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know.

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm a man.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm a man.

289
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I understand.

291
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I understand.

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's talk about the past.

293
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's talk about the past.

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to cherish the past.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I want to cherish the past.

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to kiss on this place.

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I want to kiss on this place.

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to end it.

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Kiss?

300
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why do you have to do it?

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll kiss you.

302
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't say that.

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't say that.

304
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What is it?

305
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is it?

306
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you saying?

307
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you saying?

308
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I want to kiss and end it.

309
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It hasn't started yet.

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There's nothing, right?

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's nothing.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why am I doing this?

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Where is the place to make this?

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Taisho, really, let's kiss and end it.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's end it.

316
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Please do something.

317
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll probably do it too.

318
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No way.

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You don't have to pat me.

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You can pat me.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You don't have to grab me.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Taisho.

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Taisho.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why?

326
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Endo's friend.

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It doesn't matter.

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Taisho.

329
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Endo, hurry up.

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Hurry up.

331
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you doing this to me?

332
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Endo, I'm sorry.

333
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you okay?

334
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Endo, I'm sorry.

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I've already cut three.

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's only one left.

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What?

338
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What?

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Not yet?

340
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There's one last person I really want to cut.

341
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is really the last one.

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Please.

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He's close.

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please.

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He's still here?

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What the hell are you talking about?

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Endo wants to say goodbye with more sincerity than ever.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Who is the last person?

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Everyone may already know.

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's my senior.

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yamamoto of Gokuraku Tongo.

352
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
To be honest.

353
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I thought it was okay.

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I thought it wasn't a show.

355
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So I couldn't say it.

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's something I have to give back to Yamamoto.

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's that?

358
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's homemade jam.

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Jam?

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We bought strawberries and made it together.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't need it.

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's okay to have it.

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What are you doing?

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's good to dip it in bread.

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's good to dip it in bread.

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I see.

367
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
To be honest.

368
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think it's okay to say this.

369
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The first three people are clear.

370
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
To be honest.

371
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is the main.

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I want to crush this.

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They've been in more private relationships.

374
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Today, Endo says goodbye to the person he loves.

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is it over?

376
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where's Ono?

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He's gone.

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's true.

379
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm going home.

380
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm scared that he's coming.

381
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Thank you for your hard work.

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's the best two so far.

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't have much to say.

385
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm married.

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Congratulations.

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you.

388
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I've been dating Yama for 11 years.

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's longer than my wife.

390
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't want you to get married.

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Simply put.

392
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't want you to break up with me.

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I have a lot of memories.

394
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I brought a lot of things I have to return today.

395
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What are you talking about?

396
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Who are you talking to?

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Who made this?

398
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's Jam.

399
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Thank you.

400
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I've never given you anything like this.

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What is this?

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What kind of project is this?

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What are you doing?

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I've never given you anything like this.

405
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Why do you have such memories?

406
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't have such memories.

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I know that you don't give me anything like this.

408
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm not going to deal with you.

409
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm just telling you.

410
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't think so.

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think the three of us have different things.

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm alone.

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I can't do it alone.

414
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I need everyone's cooperation.

415
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I need everyone's cooperation.

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yamazaki is also a colleague.

417
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yamamoto.

418
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm not going to date you.

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'd like you to stop it today.

420
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm going to do it with my seniors and juniors.

421
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's you, isn't it?

422
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Did you come up with a plan?

423
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know.

424
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Please don't do it for fun.

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please do it for fun.

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's what you're doing.

427
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you do it lightly like that, you'll get hurt.

428
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's better to be funny.

429
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What's the fun part?

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Isn't what I'm doing funny?

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't say that.

432
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Can I do it?

433
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Let's end it by kissing to clean up our relationship.

434
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What do you mean by that?

435
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If it's a kiss story and I'm here, I'll kiss you.

436
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Then it's over.

437
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What are you talking about?

438
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If possible, Yamamoto.

439
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's right.

440
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Think about the reality.

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Endo is not married.

442
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Give up.

443
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Why can't you give up?

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Please stop taking pictures of me next to Yamamoto.

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can't stop it.

446
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a picture that can be misunderstood.

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I can't stop it.

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You're the coolest picture.

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's meet.

450
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You were cool.

451
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You're the coolest picture.

452
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I like you the most.

453
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What do you mean to throw that picture away?

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I understand.

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But can you give me a kiss?

456
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll never give you a kiss.

457
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'll never give you a kiss.

458
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll never give you a kiss.

459
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Wait a minute.

460
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Wait a minute.

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Stop it.

462
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Stop it.

463
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop it.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can't stop it if I don't kiss you.

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Why can't you stop it if you don't kiss me?

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to end it.

467
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You said you liked me.

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I like you as my senior.

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't like you so much.

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I like you so much.

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll be in your place a week from now.

472
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Why?

473
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Because you're a cool picture.

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because you're a cool picture.

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm going to be jealous.

476
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm going to be jealous.

477
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm going to be jealous.

478
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Stop it.

479
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't want to.

480
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop it.

481
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm going to be jealous.

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's end it.

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'll never give you a kiss.

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll never give you a kiss.

485
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm going to be jealous.

486
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll run away.

487
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll run away.

488
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm going to be jealous.

489
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm going to be jealous.

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's end it.

491
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're a boar!

492
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You're a boar!

493
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's dangerous.

494
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Catch me and give me a kiss.

495
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Quick.

496
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What is this?

497
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't come close.

498
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Catch me and kiss me.

499
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is the end.

500
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Let's end it.

501
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You want to end it.

502
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's enough.

503
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Then which one?

504
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What?

505
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You answer the next question.

506
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What is it?

507
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Matsumoto Sanhaka or Hamada Sanhaka?

508
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What are you talking about?

509
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What is this?

510
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What is this?

511
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What is this?

512
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What is this?

513
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What is this?

514
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Give me a kiss.

515
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What is this?

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Why are you using lotion?

517
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Wait.

518
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a kiss.

519
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a kiss.

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's a kiss.

521
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Give me a kiss.

522
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Give me a kiss.

523
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What are you guys doing?

524
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Kei-chan.

525
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What is it?

526
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Give me a kiss.

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What is this?

528
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What is this?

529
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What is this?

530
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What is this?

531
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What is this?

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What is this?

533
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What is this?

534
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What is this?

535
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What is this?

536
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yabayaki.

537
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yabayaki.

538
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yabayaki.

539
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yabayaki.

540
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I thought you were my friend.

541
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Kei-chan.

542
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know.

543
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Kei-chan, I like you.

544
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It has nothing to do with him.

545
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It has nothing to do with him.

546
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He wants to go home.

547
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
