1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Aim for the ace!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the previous episode, you said you could play both.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I said I could play both.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, I will show you how to play both.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I think that you don't know what tennis is.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a game of violence.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is that so?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tennis is a game of violence.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes, it's a game of violence.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The stronger you grab the ball, the better.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When I play tennis, I have a lot of violence.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How do you feel?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can I play a big game?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's soft.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm serious.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Really?

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's do it.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Please show us.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Please come in.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I heard that if you play tennis for a long time, you will become a tiger.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, I won't.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The program is different.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's do it.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Give it back to me.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When I play Wimbledon, you should shut up.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Shut up.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Shut up.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you doing?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Shut up.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Shut up.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Shut up.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Shut up.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He is not good at imitating.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hamada will do it.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
When you come here, you have to break it.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You have to take it back.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You have to break it.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Can I do it?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's OK.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's do it.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Move forward.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Take it by hand.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's too fast.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Take it by hand.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can you do it?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Take it by hand.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I heard that our passion to play tennis is connected.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The god of tennis came to us.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He is here.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He told us to aim for him.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where is he?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He will be taken away.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What if we aim for him?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He will be taken away.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Even if the ball comes?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Really?

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's do it.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's do it.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did you say like this?

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It means that he is happy.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's the god of tennis.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, no.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a prank.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a prank.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a prank.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Where is the god of tennis?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Where is the god of tennis?

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where is the god of tennis?

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Actually, that is the servant of the god.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Really?

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The real god is someone else.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is he here today?

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, he is.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Really?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where is the god of tennis?

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He is here.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm so happy.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Nice to meet you.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He is different from the servant of the god.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The servant of the god is proud.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes, he is.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's strong.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's enough.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry, servant of the god.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Where is the god of tennis?

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Where is the god of tennis?

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Where is the god of tennis?

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He is still alive.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm the god of tennis.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I won't appear.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I declare it.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I won't appear.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Then, I'll dance for a while.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What is tennis?

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you very much.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Thank you very much.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's been a long time.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This program has become popular recently.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Today, there are three groups.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, there are three groups.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't think so, but it's getting hot.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't say that because I want to relax.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't say that because I don't want to relax.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't rest in summer.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't like summer in this program.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I hate summer the most.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why do you hate summer?

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because it's sticky.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, it's sticky.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My body is also tired.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think it's okay because it has a cooler.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
My cooler isn't cool, but sometimes it smells like a Kintama bag.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm not Kintama bag.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm a Kintama bag.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There is! There is!

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What kind of smell is that?

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The smell of a golden egg?

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you want?

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't you know the smell of a golden egg?

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What kind of smell is that?

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Ah, it's so close that I can smell you.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm just kidding.

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't know the smell, do you?

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know the smell.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Even the air conditioner in a car sometimes smells like that.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's a different kind of smell.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, that's the smell.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's the smell?

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's the smell of a golden egg?

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Even in the air conditioner, it comes out and stops for a moment.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm so worn out.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, no, no.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What kind of air conditioner do you use?

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I use any kind of air conditioner.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
When it comes out, it's kind of...

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It has a bad smell, doesn't it?

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes, yes.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
A smelly smell.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's the smell of a golden egg.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is that so?

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think that the people in the electrical industry are very excited right now.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They seem to be using that bag in the material of the air conditioner.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What?

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What is it?

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's why...

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Maybe...

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why are you asking in such a small voice?

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The bag is inside the air conditioner.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The golden egg bag is inside the bag.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Whose golden egg bag is that?

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It belongs to the people who committed suicide.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What kind of...

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The real golden egg...

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Did you say that?

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's the material that comes out of the air conditioner.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That sounds good.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What are you talking about?

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you looking at?

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You...

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Have you been talking for a long time?

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you the king of Samurai?

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're wearing glasses.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're a new comedian.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Get out of here!

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's dangerous.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're going to get robbed.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's strange.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're going to get a tattoo on your neck.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's different.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What were you doing?

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What did you smell?

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was eating.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Really?

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let me see.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me see.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's amazing.

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let me see.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you doing?

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you doing?

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A group of hypocrites.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Matsumaru is like this.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hamamaru is like this.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What are you doing?

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I told you.

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I told you.

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a special flash gag.

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's a special flash gag.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's funny.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What is this?

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's like moving.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What is this?

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What is this?

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's the same one that appeared in the last episode.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're so cool.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going to return this.

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's so frustrating.

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to return it.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's strange.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's written here.

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's written here.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Please continue.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Please continue.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Please continue.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's amazing.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Please continue.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Please continue.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Please continue.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Please show me your letter.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hello.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hello.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Taiko Hoshino.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm 43 years old.

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm 22 years old.

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
My hobby is to play with cats.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can play with cats.

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can play with cats.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, a little.

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's amazing.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is it a book?

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a book.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's broken.

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Thank you very much.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What is this?

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well...

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Marukome, the 8th generation.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's a big reward.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Right?

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to write it down.

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Name, date of birth,

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
address, phone number, guardian.

252
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to send you a picture.

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The audition is on June 14th.

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It doesn't have to be me.

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It doesn't have to be me.

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I said it doesn't have to be me.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I said it doesn't have to be me.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I said it doesn't have to be me.

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I said it doesn't have to be me.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I said it doesn't have to be me.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're completely different.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You don't speak a word.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The word doesn't have to be me.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What?

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't care.

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Write it down.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Look at this.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Write down the 8th generation Marukome.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm going to be on TV like this.

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're already on TV.

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's enough.

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're a healthy boy from 3 to 6 years old.

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's right.

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can you do this?

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's okay.

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know if there will be a special movie.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Choose a child from 3 to 6 years old as usual.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Moreover, when you stand next to him and run with that kid.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
At the end of July.

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
At the end of July.

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will become a bald man.

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know if I will be chosen.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Before I become a bald man.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I have to become a bald man.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then you have to do something.

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right?

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
From the beginning.

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know if I can stay until the end.

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't think about it.

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's okay if you go.

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
For the time being, let's go.

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What are you going to do when I go?

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I will go with you.

295
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Your mother is coming.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What?

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Your mother.

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I will go with my mother.

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I will put on makeup properly.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I will become a bald man.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I will become a bald man.

302
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I will become a bald man.

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I will go with you.

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I want to go with you.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I want to go with you.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's you.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's okay if you become a bald man.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's okay if you become a bald man.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's okay if you become a bald man.

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are you kidding me?

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's true.

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't make fun of me.

313
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's true.

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's been 10 years since you became a bald man.

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

316
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's okay.

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Write it down.

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't make fun of me.

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Write it down.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's your name.

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is it your real name?

322
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No.

323
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's your real name.

324
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's annoying.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Write it down.

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Write it down.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I will give it to you.

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I brought it.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's annoying.

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will put a picture next to it.

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a guardian.

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Who is the guardian?

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Write my name.

334
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I am protected by you.

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I am fine.

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's okay.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I will put a picture next to it and send it to you.

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't do this.

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You should do this.

340
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What will you do?

341
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I will write it down.

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You should do this.

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You are an amateur CM character.

344
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't do that.

345
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't do that.

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll send it to Alusjin.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, you can look at it.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No, no, no, don't say it.

349
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm too old.

350
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So, I wrote it down.

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll send it.

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm looking forward to it.

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now, let's go to the postcard.

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This girl is pitiful.

355
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This girl is a special girl.

356
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
She is from Tokyo.

357
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is it called Tatekawashi?

358
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Tatekawashi.

359
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Tatekawashi.

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You guys are too much.

361
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Everyone knows that Tatekawashi is from Tokyo.

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Tatekawashi.

363
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is the second time.

364
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No, no, no.

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll never remember it.

366
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll call it Tatekawashi until I die.

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I can't remember it.

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Please listen to the story of the most unfortunate man in Japan.

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
This man had a surgery on the day before the important university exam.

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's the only thing that's unfortunate.

371
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Even more so, the hospital where he was admitted to became a fire.

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
While he was evacuating, his wound opened up.

373
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He was finally admitted to the hospital.

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Finally, the wound was healed and he was discharged.

375
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
When he went back to his home, his house was burned down.

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Really?

377
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is very unfortunate.

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The hospital where he was admitted to became a fire.

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's amazing.

380
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know when that man is going to die.

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's why I always say this when I change my clothes.

382
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You should stop wearing black bikinis.

383
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's just a coincidence.

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't care because I'm wearing them.

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You only look like you're wearing black pants.

386
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's the only reason.

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't like wearing trunks.

388
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why?

389
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Even when I change my pants, if I wear them normally, I look like this. But if I wear them, I look like this.

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You look like this.

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Even when I change my pants, if I take them off, I look like a bag of candy.

392
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
A bag of candy?

393
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's cool.

394
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's nothing like that.

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There's no one in this world who doesn't want to see my candy.

396
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There is.

397
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I want to see it.

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Everyone wants to see it.

399
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Of course they want to see it.

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't want to see it.

401
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There's no mistake.

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't want to see it.

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I know.

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I know.

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I know.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let's laugh a little more.

407
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's laugh a little more.

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm going home. Bye bye.

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Please forgive me.

410
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's hot.

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But please wait a little longer.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't want to buy it.

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's true.

414
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I want to buy it.

415
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No way.

416
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I want to buy it.

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I want to buy it.

418
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You're kicking someone's butt like that.

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Your butt is filled with a very dangerous bomb.

421
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Do you like to say something at the end?

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Like, I'm really an angel.

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's a lie.

424
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Actually, my butt is a bomb.

425
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Where is the bomb?

426
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What's wrong?

427
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Where is the bomb?

428
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's already in here.

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
In me?

430
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is a plus and this is a minus.

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's because we're touching each other.

432
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I see.

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's in here.

434
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's right.

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm going to light it up.

436
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Ouch!

437
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wow!

438
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm going to do something like that.

439
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
My butt is full of nitroglycerin.

440
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm going to explode in one shot.

441
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Really?

442
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is there anything more important than that?

443
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If there is...

444
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't make me angry.

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

446
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
If you call me an angel like the other day, I don't know what to do.

447
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to jump out of here.

448
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Everything I say today is true.

449
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't lie.

450
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm telling the truth.

451
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Are you an angel or a liar?

452
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I told you before the bomb.

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I didn't lie.

454
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm telling the truth.

455
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What?

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What are you saying?

457
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ouch!

458
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't open it.

459
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Good evening.

460
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Good evening.

461
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was surprised by the guy who was looking at the notebook today.

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I was really surprised by that.

463
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What are you going to do if you become an idiot like that?

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You wrote it, didn't you?

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The name of the audition paper.

466
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No, I don't know.

467
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Did you write it?

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll send it to you.

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't like Marukome or Boss.

470
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I don't like it because it's a holiday.

471
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What?

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't like the name of the eighth generation.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was the only one who noticed it.

474
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't like it.

475
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But the eighth generation and the first generation...

476
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There are only small people so far.

477
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Do you think my feelings are a little weak?

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But you wrote it, didn't you?

479
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll send it to you.

480
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll send it to you.

481
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll do it.

482
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You're going to do something, too.

483
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What?

484
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're going to do something, too.

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
No, it's okay.

486
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'll do it.

487
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm going to ride a roller coaster.

488
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It doesn't matter.

489
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
From top to bottom, free fall.

490
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll do it 30 times in a row.

491
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Really?

492
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What?

493
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I got it.

494
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll do it five times.

495
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Really?

496
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What?

497
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'll do it five times.

498
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If you go to Marukome's audition.

499
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'll do it ten times.

500
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You always say,

501
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Come on, Sugakura.

502
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll never do that.

503
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you very much.

504
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's okay.

505
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll ride it all.

506
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll do it properly.

507
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Goodbye.

508
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's a lot.

509
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's do it.

510
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's do it.

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:55,000
