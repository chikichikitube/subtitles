00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsugai Yaraen, Chikichiki Yamasaki presents Perfect Oekaki!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, since I'm the host, I'll be the host.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now then, I'd like to introduce our guest.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today's guest is downtown!

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're the guest!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today, Yamasaki-san...

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, you're the guest?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you for coming today.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Please put a lot of them in your pockets.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now then, let's get started.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now then, let's explain the rules.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The 15 panels with the topic written on the back will be chosen by downtown to draw the picture.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
After drawing all of them, the elementary school girl will have to guess what the picture is about.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Furthermore, as a bonus...

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you get 5 right, you'll get 100,000 yen!

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you get 10 right, you'll get 500,000 yen!

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you get 15 right, you'll get 100,000 yen!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll be giving you this as my pocket money.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're lying.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, no.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He's been saving up a lot of money lately.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He's been saving up money?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He's been saving up a lot of money lately.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No way!

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He has a house that's worth 60 million yen, so I'm thinking of buying it.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Really?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, just one.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now then, let's draw the picture!

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
First is...

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hamada.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please choose one of the following sponsors.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Number 2.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Number 2!

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Devil!

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can choose too.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Number 12.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Number 12!

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Porsche!

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I wanted to draw a Porsche!

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is terrible.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is it?

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't laugh when you're trying to draw someone.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't laugh when you're trying to draw someone.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Excuse me.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's no more perfect.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no, that's...

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right, there's no more.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know about that!

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Matsumoto is done!

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Matsumoto, please show us!

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The shape is...

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is this?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's take a look.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hamada, here!

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I drew a devil!

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's continue.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Number 10.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Number 10!

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A bag!

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is difficult.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A bag is difficult for me too.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Number 8.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Number 8!

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It doesn't look like a bag.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is that?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Matsumoto, please show us!

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Was it wrong?

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is...

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hamada, please show us!

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is Hamada's bag!

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is...

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Throw it away.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What is this?

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is terrible.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's sold well.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where do you live?

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't laugh!

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
His face is cute.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Next, Matsumoto is done!

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Matsumoto, please show us!

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is this?

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's pretty good.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Next, Hamada is done!

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's simple.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Number 9!

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hamada, number 9!

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A ninja!

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is good.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Number 1!

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Shishimai!

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
When Matsumoto was little, he used to draw.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Next, Matsumoto's Shishimai!

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is wonderful.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What did you draw?

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I just saw it.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When he saw the bag, he looked like this.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When he saw the bag, he looked like this.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When he saw the bag, he looked like this.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hamada is a ninja!

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Next, Matsumoto's Antonio Inoki!

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Next, Matsumoto's Antonio Inoki!

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is a great work.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hamada is a foodie.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is a service problem.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is scary.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is Hamada's foodie.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is scary.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is good.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is like a slum.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Next, number 3!

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Number 3!

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is good.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is good.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is a service problem.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Number 6!

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Number 6!

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Number 5!

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Number 5!

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is difficult.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What did you draw?

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think I can't draw a入り.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's important to draw a入り.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I want to learn how to draw a入り.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can't draw a bag.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't draw a bag.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Next, number 4!

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I drew a wrong入り.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I drew a wrong入り.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is Matsumoto's drawing.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is terrible.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is terrible.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is terrible.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is terrible.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is difficult to draw.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm going to draw it.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is Hamada's gun goddess.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is...

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What is this?

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The student clothes are cut in half.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Something is stuck in my head.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is a disco.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is the last drawing.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is Ryu's drawing.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is an artistic drawing.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is Michael Jackson and Gengoro's drawing.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is my father's drawing.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is Gengoro's drawing.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is Hamada's drawing.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is Gengoro's drawing.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is my father's drawing.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is the last drawing.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is Hamada's drawing.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is Michael Jackson's drawing.

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is terrible.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What is this?

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is Moonwalk's drawing.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is Moonwalk's drawing.

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Look at this.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is a napkin.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is a napkin.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now, let's welcome the answerers.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Please.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And the girl who will draw the two of them.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hello.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hello.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is your name?

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm Ayami Kashima.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You are 9 years old.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What is your favorite talent?

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm Kimutaku.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Kimutaku.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't laugh.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is there anything cool?

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you like Downtown?

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Which one do you like?

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hamada's drawing.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hamada's drawing.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Who is the cool one?

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You still have a hairstyle.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I finished drawing.

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I came here for the time being.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's good.

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I just said I had a hairstyle.

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't think this is a good reaction.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm confused.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you done?

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I finished one job.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can't say that all the time.

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm a producer here.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was surprised at the end of last year.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you for the year this year.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is the end of the year?

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you for the year this year.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What is the end of the year?

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm confused.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hamada's hairstyle is popular all over the country.

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You are the same age as me.

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm the same age.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm the same age.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have a handsome look.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Everyone is showing it.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Everyone is showing it.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's hot.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yamasaki appeared in the last episode.

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It seems so.

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He played the role of a gentleman.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Think about it a little more.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I said one word.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I said it about five times.

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I just said one word.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Everyone is saying that.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know.

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I said one word.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't know.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yamasaki did the same thing at ANPM.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He said,

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Fresh bento.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He said it naturally.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Fresh bento.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's terrible.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It would be nice if it was fresh bento.

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He has savings.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yamasaki is a great era.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He said he would buy a house.

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's terrible.

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I asked him to come with me.

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I asked him where he was going.

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He said he was going to buy an adult's toy.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's terrible.

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He bought three toys.

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's terrible.

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't know.

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't buy it.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't like it.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can buy it.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know.

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't want to be attacked.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't want to be attacked.

244
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to buy a toy.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I have a lot of toys.

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What kind of toys do you have?

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
For example, this.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What is this?

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is a black shirt and jeans.

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's easy.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What is Hamada?

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is an old jeans.

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you talking about?

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm just saying what I bought.

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There are many.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
From Hamada to Amura.

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
How many times have I said this?

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Iijima Naoko.

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I wrote this.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Naora.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know what Naora is.

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know what Hitoshi is.

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hitoshi is looking down.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Everyone is looking down.

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This year, everyone is looking down.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Everyone is looking down.

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't want to say anything.

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ikeike, Kitsui, Bruta, etc.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I left a famous phrase that remains in history.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
When you go on a trip to the moon and get off the moon, what is the phrase that remains in history?

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is a phrase that remains in history.

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What should I say when I get off the moon?

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's wider than I thought.

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Who are you talking to?

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you talking to the fish?

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wait.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can say that.

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can't say that.

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I've never been to the moon.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Wow!

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I've never been to the moon.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What should I say?

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Are you drunk on me now?

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No.

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you were a questioner, you would have left a lot of questions.

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When you get off the moon, what is the phrase that remains in history?

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I see.

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Can I say it?

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
When you get off the moon, what is the phrase that remains in history?

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know.

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know.

297
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't care.

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Are you wearing something?

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Of course.

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm wearing space suits.

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can't go to the moon.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm wearing this.

303
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're wearing this.

304
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's transparent.

305
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can go down the stairs.

306
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I see.

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You can go down the stairs.

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I see.

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Speak!

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Speak!

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're wearing glasses.

312
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm wearing glasses.

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I spoke.

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're wearing thick glasses.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I spoke.

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're wearing thick glasses.

317
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I spoke.

318
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I spoke.

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Whoever spoke, they were all like this.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There's no one where I am.

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's much like a manzai.

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When my dog gets in the car,

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
he always sticks out his neck from the window.

324
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, I see.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I say it often.

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He gets angry because it's dangerous,

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
but he never listens to me.

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I see.

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why do dogs want to stick out their necks so much?

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're right.

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Animals are like that.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know a lot about dogs, right?

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I know a lot about dogs.

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I know why dogs are moving.

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's fine.

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, no, no.

337
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

338
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's my job.

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I get caught a little bit.

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What?

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Why are they moving?

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Dogs have a heart, right?

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, yes.

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Dogs have a heart.

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Where does that heart go?

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Here.

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where does that heart go?

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I know why this heart is moving.

349
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And dogs also know what I know.

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That sounds interesting.

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So why do dogs walk like this?

352
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't know.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What?

354
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't know.

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What?

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know.

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What do you want me to do?

358
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I want you to love me a lot.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't want you to leave me.

360
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know.

361
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know why dogs want to stick out their necks so much.

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
How many years has it been since I started using dogs?

363
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
About seven years.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
About seven years?

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I've been waiting for this postcard for seven years.

366
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not an exaggeration.

367
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's not an exaggeration.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why did you wait for such a postcard?

369
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why do dogs want to stick out their necks so much?

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's what I've been thinking.

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why don't you let me talk?

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, yes.

374
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Really, really.

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I hit the wall.

376
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But it's finally here.

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's finally here.

378
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What's the answer?

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you think is the best car?

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What is it?

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Rolls-Royce.

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think Jaguar is the best.

383
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What is that?

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey, I'm driving.

385
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm not stupid.

386
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Jaguar used to have something like this.

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That emblem is a sign of Jaguar.

388
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's getting closer and closer.

389
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Dogs are faithful.

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I want my husband to think of Jaguar.

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want my husband to think of Jaguar.

392
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That was good.

393
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I was about to lose sight of it for a while.

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I finally caught it.

395
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I think I managed to catch it.

396
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What is this?

397
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Think about it.

398
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Think about it.

399
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Put it on the microphone.

400
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Really?

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know the name.

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh my god.

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Please answer.

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It looks like a hippo.

405
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
hippo

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The second one.

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Be honest.

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This one.

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What is it?

410
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Dracula.

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I want it.

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I want Dracula.

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The third one.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Look at this.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is pitiful.

416
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Where is it?

417
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Foreigner.

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Like this.

419
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What do you call this?

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's a dinosaur.

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is the correct answer.

422
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The woman is getting bigger.

423
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's correct.

424
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's correct.

425
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Ayami, how did you know this?

426
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Where?

427
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It looks like a ring.

428
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What is this?

429
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Next is Antonio Inoki.

430
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Who is it?

431
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Lupin the Third.

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This is also his nationality.

433
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's not a castle, is it?

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Castle.

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Mazumos.

436
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
How about Michael Jackson?

437
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I thought it was Zamos.

438
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I thought it was Zamos.

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The seventh one.

440
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
How did you know this?

441
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Dragon.

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Correct.

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm glad.

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If I lose to Hamada, I'll...

445
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why did it take 32 years?

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What is it?

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The eighth one.

448
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What is Machan's habit?

449
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's like a boar.

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's like a hippo.

451
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's like Moomin.

452
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't eat it.

453
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Ayami, how did you know this?

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Ninja.

455
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is...

456
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's over.

457
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's right.

458
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Mazumos, please.

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's go.

460
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If I win this...

461
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Stop it.

462
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ayami, what is this?

463
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is...

464
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A bag?

465
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

466
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why?

467
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's true.

468
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's right.

469
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
One more question and you'll get 100,000 yen.

470
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Hamachan's A.

471
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Slime.

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Slime.

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Next, what is Machan's Porsche?

474
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sports car.

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Sports car.

476
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And Hamachan's...

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Shokupanman?

478
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Superman.

479
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That was close.

480
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This is Shokupanman.

481
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm being laughed at.

482
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And Hamachan's Gengoro.

483
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Funkorogashi.

484
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That was close.

485
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
This is the last one.

486
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay.

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If this doesn't work, I won't give you 1000 yen.

488
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If you win, I'll give you 100,000 yen.

489
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
If you win, I'll give you 100,000 yen.

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

491
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Now, Ayami.

492
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I think I know what it is.

493
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Here you go.

494
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Shachi.

495
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's right.

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Good job.

497
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Congratulations.

498
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That was a good guess.

499
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That was a good guess.

500
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This is the result.

501
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Hamachan got 3 correct answers.

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Machan got 2 correct answers.

503
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I knew it was a bag.

504
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This is strange.

505
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Why did you do that?

506
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Funkorogashi.

507
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.

508
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Takashimaya was arrested for violating the law.
