1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Who will be the winner?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today we made a board like this

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This time we spent a lot of money

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's interesting to look at it like this

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For example, this is DREAMS CAM

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
DREAMS CAM

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Right?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This will be a red group

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It will be a red group

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It will be a red group

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And Mika will be a white group

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's fine

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Wadawaki is a red group

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is a mistake

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He is a man

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
By the way

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In the 40th episode of 1989

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When Mita Yusuko and Takeda Tetsuya were in the lead

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is the first shot

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We went to the ZOOM

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the year 1942, when Yusako and Sakai were in the lead

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You lost this too

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is Karaba

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Based on this

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, look at this board

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I didn't watch the show last week

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I said it was a white group

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I said it was a white group before

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will look at this card again

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You will look at it again

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It doesn't matter if it's red

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can see that

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is it?

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There are too many meaningless people in the white group

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It can't be helped

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't need SMAP

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't need it as a white group

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
These guys

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's broken

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't think this is right

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's what I mean

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But last time, I said that the Checkers would be disbanded

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is the last time

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I thought it would be fine

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I thought it would be fine

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In the end, it's about how hard Torii will do

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who is the red Torii?

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Akiko did it last year

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She probably didn't do it for 2 years

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't know

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You don't know

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you think about it like that

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think the white group is Torii

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It doesn't seem like it

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Torii?

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then who is Torii?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't think so

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't think it's Sabu-chan

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't think it's here

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But it's the first time

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I understand

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Then

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What will you do?

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
For now, you decide

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say it

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why?

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why?

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, well, well

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, well, well

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Say it

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Say which one

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think it's the white group

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You think it's the white group?

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where did you come from?

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why did you come here?

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to stand next to them

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You want to stand next to them

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I understand

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So you and I think the white group will win

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's how it is

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right?

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This time's punishment game

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's this

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ta-da! It's Hatonina broadcasted after Nyan TV broadcast

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have to do that

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By the way, do you do it live?

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That means on Nyan TV

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
At 4 o'clock?

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At 4 o'clock

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
At 4 o'clock

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why me?

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why me?

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why me?

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A-chan is waiting for you in the cloak

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A-chan

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
At the color bar?

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
At 5 o'clock?

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you lose, you will become a pigeon

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It will be at 4 o'clock

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
For now, the red group and the white group

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
To get the right to say it first

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go to the match

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We went to Yotsuya's pachinko

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What will the game be like?

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
From now on

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Each person will take 3000 yen

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You have 20 minutes

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If I lose in 10 minutes

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What if you lose in 15 minutes?

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's my win

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Of course

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then you should do it slowly

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But you have the number of balls

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When you have it left

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Got it

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A-chan

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A-chan

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A-chan

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A-chan

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A-chan

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A-chan

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A-chan

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I might lose

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Matsumoto was sitting before

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll lose here

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Did you get it?

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, I changed it to this

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll pay before I go home

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I got nothing

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I have 1600 yen and this much left

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So you have nothing

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So for now

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll decide who gets the right to say it

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have the right

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I don't have to say red

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The match will be

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
White group and Matsumoto

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
White group

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
White group

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll do it again after this

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's Nacchan

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Sorry

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you wearing today?

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is it cute?

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Cute?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Cute?

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Who are you asking?

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Cute

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Cute

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're close

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What is it?

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're a bit sluggish

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who's sluggish?

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't get excited

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's Nacchan

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's Nacchan

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can't be sluggish

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is something wrong?

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not like that

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Really?

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
C2

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's Machan

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's fine

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't make it look like a jingle

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's stuck

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Look at it

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's round

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's go to the post

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's decided

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's decided

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Kouhaku, who will win?

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll do it

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
White

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why are you saying that?

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We had a match

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We lost

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you lose

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll say it in the opening

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
On Nittere, on a black and white screen, a pigeon will fly

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
A pigeon will fly out of the cage

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The picture will come out and the show will end

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It will become a pigeon

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Moreover, it will be broadcast live

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It will be on Nittere at 4 o'clock

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In the morning

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You will

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You will be a pigeon at 4 o'clock

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But what do you think?

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What do you think about the real thing?

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There is a rumor that Checkers is not a bird

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not a bird

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's not a bird

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's not a bird

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a bird

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Is it you who will ring the bell?

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a good excuse

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But that is

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
As you said earlier, the white bird is a bird

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Kitashima Saburo came out

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I just said it's a bird

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can't say it's a bird

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But I didn't say the name

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can't say it's a bird

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You can't say it's a bird

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Sabu-chan came out

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
As you said, if you say it's a bird

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The white bird will win

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But it's not

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a bird that looks like a bird

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's just a guess

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's not a bird

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not a bird

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But it's red

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I chose white

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But if it's red, it's blue

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But that bird will appear 2 or 3 times

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's right

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is that okay?

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It will appear 2 or 3 times

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So you don't have to do it alone

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Even if I lose to him, it's a friendly match

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Why?

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why is it a friendly match?

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a competition

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's a friendly match

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't need it

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's because you put it in

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a friendly match

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's a friendly match

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't need it

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What if I lose?

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What if white loses?

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What if I lose?

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Will you come out?

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know if I'll come out

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You'll definitely come out

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm always thinking about you

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Really

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I wonder if my hand will be okay

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I wonder if your hand will be okay

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't care about my fingers

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Stop it

260
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There's a story about whether to stop or not

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Whether it's red or white

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's either red or white

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Last year it was red

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If it's white, it's white

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So stop betting on white or red

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Will you cry or not?

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I see

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So which will you choose?

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If it's white, maybe I'll come out

270
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It doesn't matter

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's right

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you making such a loud voice?

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm right next to you

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You can't cry on TV

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can't cry in front of the lights

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's an excuse for 24 hours

277
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're persistent

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You said it 24 hours ago

279
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's hard to say whether you cried or not

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's why I think red or white is better

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I always say this every year

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a tie

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Is that possible?

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There's no such thing as a draw

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Really?

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There's no such thing as a draw

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's no such thing

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Which is it?

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How many episodes do you have with that person?

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Two?

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Three?

292
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You have three

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
One person is not enough

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If it's a draw, the producer will join

295
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right?

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The people who are watching this

297
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just look at the results

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't help it

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Who will win in the end?

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Where did your strength come from?

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You want to turn even Kouhaku into an enemy

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What's your strength?

303
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There's no such thing as a draw

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But I don't think there's a draw

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why?

306
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Kouhaku

307
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll have you say it now

308
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I was aiming for Kouhaku this year

309
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why did you aim for him?

310
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Not with you

311
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But now I'm aiming for YangYangYangYang

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think I can do it

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a bit short

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's too short

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was wondering if I could win

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's okay if it's red

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There's a lot of white

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Somehow Masa

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Toshimasa? Masatoshi?

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This Masatoshi

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Who is it?

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What are you singing?

323
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is it a drama?

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yoshida Heizaku

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yoshida Heizaku?

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Who is Yoshida Heizaku?

327
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Do you know Kenji Noriwaki?

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're crazy

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Is that so? I don't know

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There's a lot of white

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're going to lose

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I can't help it when I cry

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's right

334
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I thought so

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Kei Unsuk will cry too

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Kei Unsuk doesn't cry

337
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Kei Unsuk is the one with the beard

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He sings with BeiYan

339
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know BeiYan

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Do you know BeiYan?

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You don't know BeiYan?

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You don't know BeiYan?

344
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There aren't many Japanese people who don't know BeiYan

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
People who know BeiYan

346
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
People who don't know BeiYan

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's hard

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Wait a minute

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
People who drink iced coffee

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What did you say?

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I said that when I was Alice

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Really?

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Kei Unsuk

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If there's a happening

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If there's a happening

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It will be this

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It depends on the happening

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But I've said the happening

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It depends on the happening

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Ladies and gentlemen

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I've waited

362
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Today has started

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't say unnecessary things

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If there's a happening

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't know what will happen

366
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You can think of other things

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ah

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Where is it?

369
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's here

370
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's here

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's here

372
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's Batchan

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Actually I'm not sure if I should go to university or become a nurse

375
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You two are not worried about the future?

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm worried

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sometimes I have to say things like this

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't say bad things

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't say things like this

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You're not sure?

382
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Do what you like

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's easy

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's hard to be a nurse

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's hard

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A great person will come

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What is that?

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Injury?

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes

391
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's right

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Just looking at the blood is scary

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's right

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's a hard job

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I think it's hard to be a nurse

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What else is there?

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There are hard jobs

398
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's hard to be an AD

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In the program

400
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I think so

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's right

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Is that so?

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Is that so?

404
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's hard

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The money is...

406
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's what I'm saying

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's hard work

408
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can't do good things

409
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I can't say good things

410
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't find a woman

411
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I can't do anything

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's right

413
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I've done that many times

414
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
In the program

415
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you mean?

416
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
After it's over

417
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I like to talk a lot

418
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What are you talking about?

419
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't want to do this forever

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's what I like to say

421
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's why

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
When I talk

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I often hear that I was invited by an AD

424
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is that so?

425
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right

426
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you don't have a job

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Please do your best

428
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Quiz corner

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ballpoint pen and mechanical pencil took the sumo

430
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which one did you win?

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thinking time

432
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The answer is

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Ballpoint pen and mechanical pencil took the sumo

434
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The answer is

435
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The mechanical pencil won by pushing

436
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh yeah

437
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You called me

438
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's hard

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Why is Osaru's butt red?

440
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's not a quiz

441
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Everyone thought about it

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Osaru's butt is creepy

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
When he was born

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
His butt is like a rose

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's not because it's white

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's because it's that season

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I've seen it

449
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
His butt is creepy

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's amazing

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I wonder if he has a rose

452
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I can't say it

453
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's sincere

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
His butt is like a rose

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's like a rose

456
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Why is everyone's butt like a rose?

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's not good if everyone's butt is like a rose

458
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's okay if everyone's butt is like a rose

459
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
All monkeys are like a rose

460
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's not true

461
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm excited

462
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why is Osaru's butt red?

463
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Are you stupid?

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why is a human's butt blue?

465
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There is no blue butt

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's an example

467
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
No, it's blue

468
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You have a yellow beak

469
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is your beak yellow?

470
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is it yellow?

471
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't know

472
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't know

473
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's blue

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's an example

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I often say that the monkey's butt is red

476
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's not red

477
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's red no matter how you look at it

478
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The monkey's butt is blue

479
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not blue

480
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's blue

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a little blue

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's blue

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What are you saying?

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's a little blue

485
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's not blue at all

486
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's not a monkey

487
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The monkey's butt is red

488
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's not red

489
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's not red

490
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a monkey

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It doesn't matter how you look at it

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
There are times when you try to say the monkey's butt is red

493
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't care

494
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What?

495
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What?

496
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's true

497
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The monkey's butt is red

498
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There is no monkey with a red butt

499
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There is

500
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I found out today

501
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Your TV is strange

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Your TV

503
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's like that

504
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's true

505
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The monkey's butt is red
