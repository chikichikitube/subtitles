1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arerende.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Automo director, Bridal West!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When we first met, he was still an AD.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He was an AD, but he's now a director.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He has to get married as soon as possible.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Heipo is always like that.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Heipo is impossible.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's like going to a gynecologist and getting electrocuted in the ass.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's no way he'd get married.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's the director!

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The director is nothing.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Anyway, Automo.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We were supposed to go to a happy marriage, but there was a problem between us.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We got old.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Automo is dirty.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's not the case with Toshi.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want him to be a little more beautiful.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want him to be beautiful.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's what I'm going to do in the opening.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's go.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Automo director, please.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He's going to be happy.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How far have you come in terms of marriage?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've finished my first year of high school.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's great.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So today you're going to do it for free?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's right.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's going to cost you hundreds of thousands of yen.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There are three courses.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Beautiful boy course, plastic surgery course, and refresh course.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Beautiful boy course.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Beautiful boy course.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I knew it.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're always doing this.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm a talent.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, what did you choose?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Beautiful boy course?

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Beautiful boy course.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
First of all.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First of all.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a wrinkle stretch.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Compared to the beginning, there's a lot of wrinkles.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wrinkle stretch.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's like a wrinkle.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's like a small sword.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, please.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wrinkle stretch.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wrinkle stretch.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a good stimulation.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I recommend you to throw it away.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you crying?

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's a little.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's about 4.5 times more than the original plan.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's take a look.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're dirty.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't show your ass.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'd like to move on to the next course.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This time, by sweating.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a waste of fat.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's like a full body pack.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll prepare it for you.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Otomo-san.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll be back in a minute.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Please take a seat over there.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's even more wonderful if you look at the constellation.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Please.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Otomo-san.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's getting bigger, but it's not that big.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a very simple thing to do.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's better to do it yourself.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's hard for a newcomer to do it.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's hard for a newcomer to do it.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's about yourself.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's proof that I'm listening to you.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a mess.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's enough.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's enough.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's enough.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you very much.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Otomo-san's butt is sticking out.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's enough.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Otomo-san.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Otomo-san, you have an interesting face.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's changed a lot since the beginning.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's changed a lot.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's changed in appearance.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Next, let's look for it.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you want to die by gagging your blood?

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's okay.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's like a Tachan in the jungle.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Really?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tachan?

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Tachan?

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Tachan?

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Tachan?

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Tachan?

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Tachan?

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Tachan?

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Tachan?

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey Tachan, why did you call me Tachan once when I called you Tachan?

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're going back on your word.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're going back on your word.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Me too.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tachan.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Tachan.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I wonder if Nomoha is coming.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is bad.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is bad.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Tachan.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is good, Tachan.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
First of all, say hello.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like this.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
From the chin.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You look like a weird living thing.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Please put it down.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't talk like that.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Our director looks like a sea fish.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Revolution of the world.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The original low beauty course goes to the sewer.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is good.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Good.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What is this?

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Come here.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sit down.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sit down.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Shake your body.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Look at me and smile.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Good.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Smile more.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your mental age is about 2 years old.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's have the director look at you.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Excuse me, director.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Excuse me.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This way.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you think?

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's over.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Tachan.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tachan.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Tachan.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hello.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Good evening.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Nice to meet you.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hello.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you very much.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm back from the commercial.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm in trouble.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yesterday was Valentine's Day, right?

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was the first time in my life.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why?

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who do you think I am?

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Who do you think I am?

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think there are three.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Who do you think I am?

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I saw you when you were on Fuji TV.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You mean the fan?

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Cocoa, you bastard.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why are you angry with Cocoa?

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was angry when I was a student.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Really?

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You were not popular when you were a student.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why?

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You don't have to laugh.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why?

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You don't have to laugh.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You were dating when you were in elementary school.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's all, right?

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I thought a lot.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, no, no.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was told many times that you are my sweet honey.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Who said that?

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Many people.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was depressed yesterday.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I didn't think about anything.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I have three things.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have a cell phone, a phone message, and three eyebrows.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I didn't receive a message until yesterday.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No way.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's Valentine's Day.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't eat it.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I used to dig a lot of chocolate at Minami's house.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I used to take a lot of cars.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I used to do it.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I got a punishment at that time.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I got a punishment at the office.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You got a punishment at the office.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I wasn't at the scene today.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wasn't at the scene.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes, yes, yes.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was at the scene.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I was at the post office.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I wasn't at the scene either.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What?

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know anymore.

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know anymore.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know anymore.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Have you ever done this?

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When I graduated, all the buttons disappeared.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Please, please.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Please, please, please.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I wrote it beautifully.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right?

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I really didn't have anything.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It was like a cape.

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why?

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My eyes got dark because of the diamond.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's annoying.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Here.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Here.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't have it here either.

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I had seven here.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why?

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why?

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why?

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was doing it here.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Where?

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's all gone.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
At that time.

239
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If you become a talent, you will gradually become younger.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What is it?

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But I'm not that old.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not that old.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm not that old.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When I did Fuji TV yesterday, I did it with a guest.

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's right.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There were about 100 people.

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
When I was doing it, I was doing it like this.

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If it comes out, it won't break.

250
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This program is the same.

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's right.

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's okay to be late for a day.

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you worried because you're late?

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But it's hard to say that you don't have one.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's hard to say that you don't have one.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Just above the station.

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't sing like you're surprised.

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know who it is.

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey!

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I suddenly remembered something blue.

264
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
When I was in the first or second grade of junior high school,

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
At that time, I couldn't get one.

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was old.

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Do you cry?

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's right.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I couldn't get one.

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was depressed and went home.

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Then my mother gave me only one.

272
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I was depressed and went home.

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's okay.

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Your mother gave you one.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's right.

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You don't have one.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's right.

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There are many things.

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go home.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What?

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do you want to go to the post office?

282
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes.

283
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why?

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What should I do?

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What?

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Call me.

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There are many things.

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't care.

290
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't care.

291
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You wear different earrings every week.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How many do you have?

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is...

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't care.

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't care.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't care.

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's not true.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What was your name?

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hamamoto.

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hamamoto.

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Ham...

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hamada, right?

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You and Hamada only talk about looks.

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I have many different earrings.

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But they are the earrings of my heart.

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Kindness earrings. Courageous earrings.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wait.

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is it?

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He saw this program and wrote it down.

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I saw it.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I saw it and said it.

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When he saw this air, he said...

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm wearing kindness earrings.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's the meaning of earrings.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you understand?

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't understand.

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You may not see it.

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But I wear earrings to people who understand.

319
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I wear pendants.

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You wear pendants?

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I wear pendants.

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Friendship pendants.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I have such a kind of kindness.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I have kindness in my heart.

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Until now, I have worn earrings, rings, and bracelets.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
For example, you think your child is cute, right?

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You just said yes.

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
At that point, you wear a child-like bracelet.

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Bracelet?

331
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You wear a child-like flower earring.

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Flower earring?

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why is that a flower earring?

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's what it is.

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I understand that.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You wear something meaningless.

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What is meaningless?

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Kindness earring.

339
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What is kindness earring?

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
For example, when you are talking, you slip and fall off the stage.

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You can reach out your hand when something happens.

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Kindness earring.

343
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It makes you shine.

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It makes your eyes shine.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
When Mr. Matsumoto calls you, you say I, I, or sometimes you say Washi.

346
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Sometimes you say Oira.

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It is not unified.

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How do you use it?

349
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
How should I put it?

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I am...

351
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I am five-syllable.

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Basically.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Wait a minute.

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Basically, you are five-syllable.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't understand what you mean.

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How should I put it?

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There are two people above me.

358
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What is inside of me?

359
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What is it?

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Inside of me?

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes.

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
For example, when you are angry.

363
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
When you are angry.

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
When you are angry, the person above you, Soichiro, appears.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you understand?

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hold on a little longer.

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you understand?

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

370
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And when you are moved by something and you start to cry,

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Ryuji from Jinan appears.

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Ryuji from Jinan.

373
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And the neutral state is Mr. Matsumoto.

374
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I see.

375
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why do you say it like that?

376
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I see.

377
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's what it means.

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Do you understand?

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Everyone has it.

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When you are angry or crying, it's not the same.

381
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
For example, you are walking on the street.

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You are walking on the street.

383
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
When you hit your shoulder, Soichiro appears.

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ryuji blocks it.

385
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Wait.

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't come out.

387
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
If you are blocked, you can endure it.

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If you are not able to endure it, you become Soichiro.

390
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes.

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You become slightly green.

392
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You run fast.

394
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Soichiro.

395
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's good.

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's good.

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You run fast.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I see.

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Ryuji is strong against water.

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He is strong against water.

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think he is doing something.

403
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Why do you bring bread to school when you have a day off?

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you bring it to school?

405
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Or do you bring it to school?

406
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think I bring it to school.

407
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I see.

408
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think I bring it to school when I have a day off.

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't like it.

410
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Do you know that?

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Bread is made of yeast.

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Bread is made of yeast.

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Shut up and listen.

416
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He is the right person for this program.

417
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's talk about it here.

418
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
For example, Kimura-kun.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Kimura-kun has a day off.

420
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Kimura-kun.

422
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Come tomorrow.

423
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

424
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Come tomorrow and have fun with your classmates.

425
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes.

426
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Right?

427
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes.

428
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why do you bring bread to school?

429
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Kimura-kun.

430
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Kimura-kun has a day off.

431
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes.

432
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Kimura-kun.

433
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Come tomorrow and have fun with your classmates.

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Come tomorrow.

435
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's what it means.

436
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I had a toothache the other day.

437
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It doesn't matter.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I went to the dentist and had a toothache.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was a dentist.

440
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Really?

441
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I had a toothache.

442
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I could see my gums.

443
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

444
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Why do women who can see their gums feel bad?

445
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Do they feel bad or smell bad?

446
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Please tell me the good points of women who can see their gums.

447
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I think women who can see their gums are cute.

448
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I think women who can see their gums are cute.

449
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
When they smile.

450
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
When they smile.

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
When they smile.

453
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
When they smile.

454
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I feel like I'm going to jump.

455
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I understand.

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think there are good points of women who can see their gums.

457
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I have to tell you that.

458
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Teacher.

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes.

460
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I've done a lot of research about that.

461
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Really?

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The library is a house.

463
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's an orphanage.

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's an orphanage.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I've done a lot of research about that.

466
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The probability of having a traffic accident is very low.

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If your gums are big?

468
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You all know that.

469
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If your gums are big, they shine at night.

470
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They shine at night?

471
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know.

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You don't know?

473
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't know.

474
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So, when you take a picture, you smile when you see your gums.

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But when you smile, the picture looks like this.

476
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I like that.

477
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You like it.

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I like it.

479
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But they all shine, right?

480
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They all shine.

481
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What's the point of having a lot of children?

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's why, when you're walking at night, you'll understand.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Even if they jump out.

484
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This, you, this...

485
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What is it?

486
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This isn't funny.

487
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It was written in some magazine.

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
They sent it to me.

489
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Gaki no Tsukai. From July 1992 to May 1993.

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's 35 times.

491
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So, what you did to me.

492
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
One neck tightening.

493
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
One pull of the cheek.

494
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
One punch with both hands.

495
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
One kick of the knee.

496
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Two punches of the cheek.

497
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Two pinches of the nose.

498
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
One kick of the butt.

499
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Fourteen times of the elbow.

500
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Thirty-nine times of the head.

501
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Thirty-six times of the head.

502
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sixty pinches of the butt.

503
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Ninety-three times of the butt.

504
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Ninety-nine pinches of the butt.

505
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Two pinches of the butt.

506
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
One hundred and fifty-nine pinches of the butt.

507
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
On the contrary, three pinches of the butt.

508
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Where did you get that magazine?

509
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't have a talk show.

510
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm surprised.

511
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Is that so?

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm surprised.

513
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I get up in the middle of the night.

514
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Really?

515
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That's amazing.

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I didn't know that.

517
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No, no.

518
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I didn't know that.

519
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
