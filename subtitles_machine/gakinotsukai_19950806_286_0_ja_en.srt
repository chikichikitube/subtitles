1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's a hot day for all the viewers of Gaki no Tsukai. How are you all doing?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Tonight, we have a special gift for you all.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is a recording from downtown Gaki no Tsukai Yara.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's been 7 years since the show started.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are more and more friends of Gaki no Tsukai.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's take a look at the memories of that start together.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Gaki no Tsukai Kouyuuroku, where old friends come back to life.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, let's begin.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
First, a scene from when Gaki no Tsukai was still young.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Yara, Chikichiki Gentenpappa!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good evening.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please welcome the children.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please come in.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please look to the side.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Your father is a yuakashi pot.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Father, please come out.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Father, please come out.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What is that?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is that so?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They look alike.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They look alike.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's introduce them once again.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is Harada Daichiro.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What does Kotaro think about his father in the variety show?

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He thinks it's wonderful.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What?

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's no way he would think that.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is Kotaro's opinion.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone's opinion.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Everyone's opinion.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I got it.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
People pull.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No!

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The second episode of Gaki no Tsukai Yara, Jicchan Bacchan Gakurenbo!

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is Namikoshi-sensei.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's here again.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He was hiding in the car the other day.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He's here again.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And this is Komori no Obajama.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hello.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's here for the first time.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Downtown is looking for Jicchan Bacchan hiding in the model room.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He's definitely looking down on me.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He's here.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's standing up seriously.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He has a three-dimensional look.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's amazing.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But he never moves.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He never moves?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He doesn't even put his fingers in his nostrils.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's really tall.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The third episode of Gaki no Tsukai Yara, Jicchan Bacchan Gakurenbo!

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's in this room.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's amazing.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Huh?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I hear something.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you looking for?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you looking for?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you looking for?

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is that?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So, Jicchan Bacchan Gakurenbo.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That was hard.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was a huge success.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jicchan Bacchan did it for me.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Say something.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It was fun.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm glad.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And this year, he appeared on this program and took on this challenge.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Just by looking at this house, I get the feeling that it's an inn.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, it is.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Did you really come here?

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did you really come here?

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is that an inn?

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey, you.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're dressed funny.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I heard about you.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Did you really come here?

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's funny.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's nice.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then, let's run.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Please run.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's do our best.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Can you show us once?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're practicing.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then, let's go.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm nervous.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then, let's go.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's go.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
4, 3, 2...

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm nervous.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're doing too much.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Then, we'll wait for you next time.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We'll wait for you.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
From this point on, Gaki no Tsukai will advance to the Golden Age.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And they're going to challenge themselves in many different projects.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara, Chiki Chiki Jicchan Paachan Gesture Tournament!

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Good evening!

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Start!

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's quite detailed.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ah!

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's the Olympics.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can say whatever you want.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You really can't say anything.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You have to look here, not my face.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm angry!

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Here is the question.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is it?

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well...

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Devil!

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're right to choose this one.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's fine!

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara, Chiki Chiki Jicchan Paachan Gesture Tournament!

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And the special episode, Omae So Chan Ka Grand Prix.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The memorable first episode started with these talents.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
First, this is Kenji Nagira.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you for coming.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then, Tenme Sano.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is Matsumoto Hitachi.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The last question is this!

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What a big-looking entertainer!

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's see.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nonio-san.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is a big-looking one.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Which one is it?

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Matsumoto-san, stop putting them together.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Kenji Nagira.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Masabuchi.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Wada Akiko-san.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Matcha.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Norio Nishikawa.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Matsumoto-san.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Norio Nishikawa.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's Matsumoto-san.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's Matsumoto-san.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a big-looking one!

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Matsumoto Hitachi!

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The famous lyrics and this kind of drama.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's been three months since she left this house.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There's no sign of her leaving.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've become like a princess.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't like it.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You!

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Put one on me.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't drink anymore!

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Shut up!

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I got it.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Just one.

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You!

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You stole my money again!

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You idiot!

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't take that money!

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Shut up!

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You!

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Actually, I have something to tell you.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In my belly...

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
...is your baby!

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In a nameless town in the north...

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
...snow falls like tears.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
A happy woman is crying...

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
...as the cold night breeze passes by.

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I want to live with a man who has left.

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Even such a small dream...

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
...and this unreachable body...

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
...are painful.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
For my sake...

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:09,000
...I chase after that dream.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What are you doing?

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I brought the finishing touch.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, you're taking it out!

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And now, there are these three people...

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
...who can be called illusions.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm Matsu-chan!

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm Omo-chan!

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm Ichidai Juunichi!

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We're three Maito!

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We're still rookies, but...

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's almost time.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm telling you to do your best, but...

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But, you know...

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
...you can't be a comedian.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can't be a comedian.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You can't be a comedian because...

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
...no matter what you say, the car you're driving...

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
...is amazing. It's amazing.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is that so?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you know what Sen Masao-san's car is?

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a Rolls-Royce.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's amazing.

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's amazing, right?

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you know what Katsura Bunchin-san is driving?

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Ferrari.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What?

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is it a supercar?

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can't be surprised by something like that.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Badan-san from Chaos-Bodan.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The car you're driving is...

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
...a fire truck.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's right.

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey!

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What are you saying?

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, no, no, no.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can't be a comedian.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't be a comedian.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't be a comedian.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can't be a comedian.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can't be a comedian.

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What do you want to do?

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, I'm good at singing.

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to release a record.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're good at singing?

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Can you sing?

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I can sing. Leave it to me.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What's your favorite number 18?

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Nakajou Kiyoshi's Lies.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Nakajou Kiyoshi's Lies.

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Then today, let's have our guests listen to it.

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Please listen to it.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Where did you guys come from?

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What?

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Where did you guys come from?

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Where did you come from?

240
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's a little confusing.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's confusing because we did it in Paris.

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I see.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll do it next time.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's the only one who dances.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm counting on you.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm counting on you.

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's broken.

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
How many times do I have to tell you to sing?

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How many times do I have to tell you to sing?

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
After the end of the show, the memorable problem will appear.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Please look forward to it.

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Next time, let's have a special program to make Yamazaki stand up.

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yamazaki's mini-prank.

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
After this, it will be a talk show with a Yamazaki host.

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It is not known that a scary star will appear.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's have a special program to make Yamazaki stand up.

259
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's have a special program to make Yamazaki stand up.

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Can I do it here?

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Can I do it here?

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's Yananobo.

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hobby.

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yananobo-san, what kind of hobbies do you have?

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Alcohol and women.

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Alcohol and women?

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a good hobby.

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you think it's a good hobby?

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes, it's a good hobby.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I see.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What about you guys?

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm scared.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hey.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What?

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's stop the tape.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's a different story.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Who is responsible?

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Call him.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hey.

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Hey.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What's next?

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Why are you doing this again?

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Can Yamazaki stand up now?

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Can he?

291
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This year's special program has more than 20% ratings.

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's introduce the first user.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's introduce him again.

294
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
First of all, Murakami Shoji-san.

295
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Nice to meet you.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Next to him, Dave Spector-san.

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Hello.

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Last but not least, Matsumoto Hida-san.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's listen to him.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's listen to him.

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
When did you start?

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We've been watching TV for a long time.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you the king today?

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Where am I?

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The chair here is a change.

306
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if you're going to sit here.

307
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But it's comfortable to sit.

308
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's good, isn't it?

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's expensive, isn't it?

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm already in.

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm already in.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's comfortable to sit.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I didn't notice it.

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's go.

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Jaka-chan.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
ZO.

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll go with ZO.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Welcome to Kamu-de Kamu-do.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Who said it's a joke?

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
ZO-san.

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What's this?

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a soap.

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a soap.

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's not good.

326
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Goro-san.

327
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Take a good look at this mirror.

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What's this?

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's a light bulb.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a diamond.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a diamond.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
In the fourth episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara Hende Tsuki Tsuki,

333
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Dachio Club Ryu-chan's coordinated strategy.

334
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Let's call him right away.

335
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's call him right away.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
First of all,

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Aina.

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Retsuzaku.

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Hino-chan.

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ryu-chan's coordinated strategy.

341
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's call him right away.

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's call him right away.

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's take a look at his coordinated strategy.

344
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ryu-chan, go ahead.

345
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's not good.

346
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Everyone.

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He's wearing a jersey.

348
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a helmet.

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a helmet.

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's not good if it's written like this.

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's not good if it's written like this.

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Go home.

353
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Go home.

354
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know.

355
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't know.

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's go home.

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Good work, Ryu-chan.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll be late for school tomorrow.

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
After the CM,

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The Gaki no Tsukai's best ratings project has appeared.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's not good if it's written like this.

362
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a helmet.

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's not good if it's written like this.

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a helmet.

365
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's not good if it's written like this.

366
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a helmet.

367
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a helmet.

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's a hit project to hit the point of the guest who was called without knowing anything.

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a hit project to hit the point of the guest who was called without knowing anything.

370
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What is this?

371
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But, but.

372
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But, but.

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's a helmet.

374
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Everyone was dead.

375
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Well, it's called Cinderella.

376
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Is it a dead person?

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm not excited to do such a thing.

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I change the color every day.

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How is it?

380
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't you wear earrings on your nose?

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you wear earrings on your nose?

382
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you open your nose?

383
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No, I don't open it.

384
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How many kinds of shoes do you have?

385
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think I have about 70 or 80 pairs of shoes, including the ones I don't wear.

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Turn around and show it to everyone.

387
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Turn around and show it to everyone.

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Turn this way.

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You did a good job.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You're a weird guy.

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What are you doing?

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No, no, no.

393
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Thank you very much.

394
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You're a weird guy.

395
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you doing?

396
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're a weird guy.

397
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I have something here.

398
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's something like this.

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm not going to play with it.

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I thought I'd do it.

401
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm not going to play with it.

402
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I have something here.

404
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Thank you very much.

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll announce the results.

406
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You only had 10,000 points for your one shot.

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
After that, Kaga's father touched it.

408
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You only got 50 points, right?

409
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's right.

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I threw away my shoes.

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Kaga's father touched it.

412
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is it?

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You have a lot of savings.

414
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You have a lot of savings.

415
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I have a lot of savings.

416
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I have a lot of savings.

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm really sorry.

419
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And this is the famous program of the staff.

420
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Downtown Dinner Show.

421
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Please listen to Yugeyuke Humor.

422
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Burning red.

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The center of the night.

424
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The star of the year.

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What is it?

426
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What is it?

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What is it?

428
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Run away.

429
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Who is it?

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Who is it?

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
At the end of this year, Sakamoto from all over the world came to the program as a fan.

432
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He made that star debut in New York.

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We got the teacher girls.

434
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Get in the show.

435
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Coming out here from Japan.

436
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Take it to our tan-tan.

437
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Y'all ready, boys?

438
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Make some noise.

439
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Make some noise for him.

440
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
All right?

441
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's go, grandma.

442
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
With the warm cheers from the various stars, the downtown kids continue to run today.

443
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Attractive guests gave the program dreams and spread.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We look forward to seeing more interesting dreams with you who are watching TV.
