1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm in Ginza today.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, really?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You're walking, aren't you?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is Ginza's club street.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Club street.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In Osaka, it's called Kitashinchi.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I see.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Kitashinchi's club street and Tokyo's Ginza's club...

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Show me Ginza's club.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All of a sudden?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Take this!

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you having a fight with a kid?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I shouldn't have done that.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As time goes by,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
there are a lot of beautiful places.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's still a little early.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you the owner of the club?

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Who?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm the middle-aged lady.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I see.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're a bully.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What are you doing?

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Stop it.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you doing?

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Are you showing me?

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Are you showing me?

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I found you.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're the real thing.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yaki-udon has a lot of power.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to get rid of your hair.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where are you now?

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's the name of the shop?

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
4th floor.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
4th floor.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How old are you?

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
19 years old.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What were you doing before you got a job?

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What?

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Were you a high school student before you got a job?

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Were you a teacher?

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't tell me.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Today, I'm going to show you

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ginza Shogun.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to show you Ginza Shogun.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was so excited every time I saw you.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Really?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're a good audience.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, you're a good audience.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's raining.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hang in there.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hang in there.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Actually, I don't have a good body.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're a weirdo.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I usually take a break.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't take a break.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to work hard.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to work hard.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to work hard.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to work hard.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to work hard.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How many times have you been here today?

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sixth time.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sixth time.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sixth time.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're still going on.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's amazing.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No more.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Really.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a little hard to do.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's hard to do because it's a night of martial arts.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There's a lot of stuff going on.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When something weird happens,

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There's a lot of stuff going on.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's hard to say.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's really a martial art.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There was a riot incident a while ago.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll show you this one.

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll show you this one.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can still see it in Osaka.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They're running around in the car.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They're noisy.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sure they're here, too.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sure they're here, too.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They're driving a car.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They're driving a car.

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There's some people driving in a box.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you look inside,

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
with a plastic bag.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You know what I mean, right?

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'd rather smoke in a plastic bag.

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They're driving and changing plastic bags.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're all smoking.

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No.

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They're not in the car.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a plastic bag.

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They're protesting.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're driving a car and you're sleeping!

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's probably one guy in the emergency room who's got that much money.

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why don't you just buy a car instead of driving it?

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What's wrong with that?

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you feel sick when you're in the emergency room, you should just buy a car.

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But if you have money, you can't do anything good, right?

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, they're just walking around, you know?

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They're just bad for you, right?

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, they're bad for me.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And there's that guy who's got a house in the house that his parents gave him.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That guy's got a house?

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And he doesn't have a head, so he puts his own woman in there.

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you break up, what are you going to do?

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yoshiko's life.

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yoshiko's life?

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Keiko's life.

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Keiko's life?

126
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The guy who's a little funny.

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A cicada's a week's life.

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's got nothing to do with that!

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's got nothing to do with that!

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A cicada's a week's life.

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yoshiko's life.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Keiko's life.

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
A cicada's a week's life.

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I know that even if you don't say it.

135
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's funny, isn't it?

136
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're so dumb, you know?

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know, the guy who's walking around, what do you call him here?

138
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The guy who's called Yankee in Osaka, right?

139
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yankee, right?

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The guy who's got his hair out like this.

141
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's got a woman in there.

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You know?

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's walking around like this.

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He's got nothing to do with that!

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He's walking around and he's got a cicada in there.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's true.

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They're walking around and they're got a cicada in there.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why do they do that?

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They're very careful.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They know when to go the wrong way.

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If they go the wrong way, they'll go to the wrong direction.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're so dumb!

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They can't go home on a rainy day.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You can't go home on a rainy day, can you?

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're the cicada that's walking around.

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've seen you sitting down.

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's that?

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The convenience store?

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I've never seen you sitting down in front of the convenience store for 24 hours.

161
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you a beast?

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I've never seen you like this.

163
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can't sit down.

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're walking around.

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're a fool!

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can't sit down like that.

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Even if I tell you how to walk.

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can't sit down like that.

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you walk like that, you'll get tired when you get home.

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's 8 o'clock in the morning.

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It doesn't matter what time it is.

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You've done it before, haven't you?

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're so stupid when you're in high school.

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're a bad person.

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And you're wearing your mom's underwear.

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, no!

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll give you 200 million yen for that.

178
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll give you 200 million yen for that.

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll give you 200 million yen for that.

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're the worst!

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You were the most suspicious one in the last case.

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You took a little child with you.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You called me later and said you'd take my money.

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's the worst.

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hello.

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hello.

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll take your money.

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's wrong with him?

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're so straightforward.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Think about what you said at first.

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You don't have the right to take money at all.

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hello.

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't you have a 2nd grader son?

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I do.

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have a 6th grader son.

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't care!

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't care how old you are!

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't want to hear it!

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just say it!

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
How old am I?

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's none of your business!

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Your son is in my care.

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

204
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's in my care.

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't be surprised.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't want to hear it!

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't care how old you are!

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't care how old you are!

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't want to hear it!

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hello?

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes?

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Bring me some money.

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Money?

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I have a 2nd grader son.

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't care how old you are!

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't care how old you are!

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't care how old you are!

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't care how old you are!

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't care how old you are!

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't care how old you are!

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't care how old you are!

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hello?

223
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hello?

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes?

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm in Czechoslovakia.

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's not what I meant.

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's too far!

228
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you coming to Czechoslovakia?

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Get out of my way!

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hello?

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes?

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you know about the 2nd grader son?

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, I do.

234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He lives in Czechoslovakia.

235
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is that so?

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Bring him here.

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll tell you the price.

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
5 million yen.

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
5 million yen?

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's expensive.

242
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
5 million yen, right?

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you crazy?

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know much about business.

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
5 million yen, right?

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's fine.

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you tell me the price, I'll bring it to you.

249
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It doesn't matter if it's expensive or not.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If it's not, I'll do something about it.

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're crazy.

253
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Tell me the price.

254
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're a poor man, too.

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're the closest yakuza to everyone.

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Bring me the money.

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll be nice, so bring me the money.

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hello?

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes?

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't talk too much.

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Bring me 5 million yen.

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
5 million yen, right?

263
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
5 million yen.

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

265
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have to fool the people around me.

266
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

267
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Bring it to me as you said.

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay.

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Listen carefully.

270
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Put 5 million yen in the green bag.

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Write on the white paper that it's a yellow bag.

272
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you put it in a red bag, I'll put it in a black bag.

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Do you understand?

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Write something.

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why don't you write something?

276
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can write it in a blue bag.

277
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

278
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Bring it to me in a blue bag.

279
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bring it to me in a blue bag.

280
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why do you do as you say?

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Bring it to me in a blue bag.

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay.

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't be late.

284
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you're late, I'll go ahead.

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Where are you going?

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're always late.

288
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're like a second-hand box.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm here.

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hello.

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Please come.

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll go.

295
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Please come.

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll go.

297
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello.

301
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello.

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hello.

303
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't be surprised to hear it.

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What?

305
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
My mother told me not to call for a long time.

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's noisy.

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey, camera man.

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And she goes to the front.

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

310
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

311
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's absolute.

312
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
She has a long leg.

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, thank you very much.

314
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm glad you're here.

315
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please come again.

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're not doing well.

317
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm about to fall.

318
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sorry.

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm not sure if you'll be angry because it's Japanese TV.

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The Giants won the championship.

321
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's great.

322
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why do you want to win the championship so much?

323
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's our song.

324
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think it's happy to be able to be so desperate.

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think it's happy.

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I think it's very interesting.

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's like trying to cheer for the team that you like.

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You like that player, so you cheer for that team because they're good.

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, all of them are...

330
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
All of them?

331
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm tired of them!

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm just going to say it.

333
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm just going to say it.

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are 6 teams in Perique.

335
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
6 teams in Perique.

336
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There are 6 teams in Perique.

337
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
6 teams in Perique.

338
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The probability is that we'll win once every 6 years, right?

339
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What's that?

340
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's the strength of every team, right?

341
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're saying that too, but you had a midday hat on when you were in elementary school, right?

342
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I had a hat on because I liked that hat.

343
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't wear it.

344
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why did you have a midday hat?

345
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't really like the 9 players.

346
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What are you talking about?

347
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you get beaten up by a pitcher, you'll say,

348
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I said to her, well, it can't be helped, it's only three days in a year, so it's fine if you take three days off.

349
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll introduce you to the assistant today.

350
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The assistant?

351
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I haven't decided yet.

352
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
She's still a staff member.

353
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Thank you very much for today.

354
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I said this for the sixth time today, but I'm wondering if we're going to do any more jokes.

355
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's a lot of things.

356
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What should we do?

357
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's fine.

358
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You don't want to sleep?

359
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I want to do something different.

360
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I think everyone wants to see a comedy.

361
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think it's fine.

362
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Can I call Nami's name?

363
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Nami-chan is 16 years old.

364
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm suddenly nervous.

365
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I want to do it with Masatoshi-sama.

366
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Is that so?

367
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
My body is hot.

368
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's so intense that my body and mind are broken.

369
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I really want to do a comedy.

370
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm a little depressed, but I want to see Hamada-san live.

371
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I want to see Hamada-san in person.

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There are a lot of Hamada-kun fans.

373
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm not a Hamada-kun fan.

374
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll give you that word as it is.

375
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hamada-kun is a very decent person.

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't be silly.

377
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm serious.

378
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How can you say such a thing?

379
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Your fans can't keep their eyes on you.

380
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I was driving a car in Osaka.

381
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
When I stopped in Shingo-machi, I was surprised.

382
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
At that time, you were wearing a color.

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I found a car in the world.

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I stopped in Shingo-machi.

385
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was surprised.

386
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Hamada-kun's fans are strange.

387
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hamada-kun was annoying, so I killed him.

388
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hamada-kun was annoying, so I killed him.

389
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Where are you now?

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm going to bury you now.

391
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hamada-kun is in the trunk.

392
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Hamada-kun is in the trunk.

393
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hamada-kun is in the trunk.

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hamada-kun is in the trunk.

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hamada-kun is in the trunk.

396
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Your fans are strange.

397
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I have a grandmother who is in her 30s.

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She is always angry.

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I got a letter from her daughter.

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
She said, I'm sorry.

403
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's strange.

404
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I stopped in Shingo-machi.

406
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I was scared.

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was scared.

411
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm a fan of Downtown.

412
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm a fan of Downtown.

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm a fan of Downtown.

414
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have a lot of fans.

415
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I have a lot of fans.

416
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When we were in Nijome Theater,

417
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It was like a shutter of Tetsugoshi.

418
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It was a sliding method.

419
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was going to go out.

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I got a letter from Tetsugoshi.

421
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm a fan of Tetsugoshi.

422
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm a fan of Tetsugoshi.

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm a fan of Tetsugoshi.

424
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm a fan of Tetsugoshi.

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I know that.

426
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Please calm down.

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Please calm down.

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Wow!

429
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's crazy.

430
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He,

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He,

432
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He,

433
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Wow!

434
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
…

435
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
…

436
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
…

437
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,000
…

438
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
…

439
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
…

440
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think it's great that you're back to being a fan.

441
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, but I don't get it.

442
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're the only one who said such a thing.

443
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sure you'll say that you're a fan because you don't know anything about Hamada.

444
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But if you know all the bad things about you, you'll never be a fan.

445
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You'll blame it all on me.

446
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Bad things?

447
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't have any bad things.

448
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No, really.

449
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What?

450
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Nothing.

451
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I really don't have any bad things.

452
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What do you mean you don't have any bad things? You're the one who started it all.

453
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're the one who started it all.

454
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Normally, when you're at work, you're surrounded by your friends.

455
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Whether it's early in the morning or late at night.

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Good morning!

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No matter how tired you are.

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Good morning!

459
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What are you?

460
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm Kurasa Hamada.

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How many years have you been a player in this world?

462
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What are you waiting for?

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What kind of person are you?

464
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm Japanese.

465
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's because you have low blood pressure in the morning.

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Normally you say that, but when you're with the staff, you become that smelly fart.

467
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you put up with it, you'll get a stomachache.

468
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Your fart isn't a normal fart.

469
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You have to think about it with everyone.

470
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a really smelly fart.

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If it's a girl, she'll cry.

472
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's really smelly.

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
She'll laugh at you because she's never farted.

474
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It'll stick to your skin.

475
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't fart.

476
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't fart if you have a bad mouth.

477
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't have a bad mouth.

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You can hear that Osaka people have a bad mouth.

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If Osaka people hear this, they'll get angry.

480
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's true.

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What kind of bad mouth?

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Is it a bad mouth?

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If you have a bad mouth, you'll have wrinkles on your face.

484
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's scary.

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Everyone will get angry.

486
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
My face is in the middle.

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If I do this, everyone will get angry.

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Everyone will get angry.

489
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't say it's a bad mouth.

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't say it's a bad mouth.

491
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's strange.

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't say it's a bad mouth.

493
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't say it's a bad mouth.

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Lastly, I did it.

495
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Osaka dialect.

496
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Dengana.

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What does dengana mean in Tokyo dialect?

498
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What is dengana?

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What is dengana?

500
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's desu-gana.

501
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's good.

502
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's not gana.

503
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's desu-gana.

504
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's difficult.

505
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's not something.

506
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's not something.

507
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's not something.

508
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's dengana.

509
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not a postcard.

510
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's not a postcard.

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a postcard dengana.

512
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not.

513
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's not dengana.

514
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's mangana.

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm a mangana who can fly from here to there.

516
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That doesn't happen in everyday conversation.

517
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I can fly from here to there.

518
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's why I'm a mangana who can make a phone call.

519
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm a mangana who can make a phone call.

520
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm a mangana who can make a phone call.

521
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm a mangana who can make a phone call.

522
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's wrong.

523
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You should have a phone call and a mangana.

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You should have a phone call and a mangana.

525
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's right.

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Young people are hard to talk to.

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You're a mangana with a postcard.

528
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's wrong.

529
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's definitely wrong.

530
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's already started.

531
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's over.

532
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You said you'd do it again next week.

533
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's right.

534
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What?

535
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't remember because I'm an idiot.

536
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do you do the same thing?

537
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's not right.

539
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll do it again next week.

540
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't know how much I'll be able to edit today.

541
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You talked a lot.

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I talked for about 25 minutes after the story ended.

543
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why do I have to talk so much when I have a sore throat?

544
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I heard another man say, stop it.

545
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I couldn't stop it.

546
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Today, we have a guest.

547
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He's from Settai.

548
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He came to see us.

549
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like this.

550
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm looking for a celebrity.

551
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll make a special guest.

552
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But you.

553
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If you sit in front of me, it'll be hard to do it.

554
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You can't sit in front of me.

555
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He's a big guy.

556
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm still looking for an assistant.

557
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll add a picture to the poster.

558
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm here.

559
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm sitting on the mountain.

560
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is the last time.

561
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But.

562
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But.

563
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's not strange to say it's the end.

564
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's not strange to say it's the end.

565
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's not strange.

566
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This way of using it can be done either way.

567
00:23:37,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's not strange to say it's the end.
