00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
Today, we are going to visit the house of Team Zero, Noriyasu Yamazaki, who is the host of our program.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,800
I heard that he moved to the house of Team Zero.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
It's been two weeks.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,600
But I don't live in a place where I don't think I'm Japanese.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,400
Today, we are going to move to the house of Team Zero.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,300
That's right. We can't do anything, but we thought hard about the present for Team Zero.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:33,000
So today, I'm going to tell you about the present.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm calling you today.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Teacher, how is it?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,100
My junior moved today.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,600
He lives in a terrible place.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,200
I see.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
If you don't have a present, let's do it.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Let's do it.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Let's do it.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Hello.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Hello.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I heard that you moved.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I brought a present.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
A cake.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Thank you.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Let's do it.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Let's eat.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Yamazaki, don't stop.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I heard that you moved today.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I brought a present.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
A cake.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Thank you.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Let's do it.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's eat.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Yamazaki, don't stop.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I heard that you moved today.

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm interested in the direction of the house where I moved.

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
That's right.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
In the real world, there are many famous people.

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I want you to tell me the direction of the house and if there is anything in the house.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Really?

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Teacher, please come in.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Teacher.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
What is this room?

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
This is the room where I moved.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
This is a terrible room.

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
What?

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
This is terrible.

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Is it terrible?

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
This is terrible.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
What?

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Are you crying?

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm surprised.

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm serious.

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
If this happens, I won't be able to leave the theater.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Are you serious?

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
This is not good.

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
What?

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Everyone is following me.

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
This is terrible.

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
This is terrible.

60
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
This is terrible.

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
This is terrible.

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
This is terrible.

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Everyone is silent.

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Everyone is silent.

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't like this.

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
But, arrested people are like that.

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Listen to me, properly.

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Teacher, don't you trust me?

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I don't trust you.

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
But, in reality,

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
someone is dick-headed.

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
You are crazy.

73
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
What?

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Don't be mad.

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Sit down.

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes.

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I will be righteous.

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You are right.

79
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
We wanted to have fun.

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Do you want to quit?

81
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,800
It's not just fun.

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,160
Shit.

83
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,140
I really did.

84
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
I don't have time for that.

85
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm a genius!

86
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm a genius!

87
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm a genius!

88
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,140
I'm a genius!

89
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm a genius!

90
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Thank you very much.

91
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Thank you very much.

92
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
Good luck.

93
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,140
Thank you very much.

94
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,140
Thank you very much.

95
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,140
We'll do the rest.

96
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,140
That was good.

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,140
That was good.

98
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
It's all thanks to you.

99
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
We're all making money.

100
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
It's true.

101
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,140
It's true.

102
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,140
It's true.

103
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Thank you.

104
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Let's go to Ise.

105
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:54,140
Let's go to Ise.

106
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
This will make peace.

107
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,140
This will make peace.

108
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,140
It's the morning of peace.

109
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
It's the morning of peace.

110
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
I won!

111
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,140
I won!

112
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,140
Yamazaki.

113
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Congratulations.

114
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
This is crazy.

115
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,140
This is crazy.

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Yamazaki.

117
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,140
You're the one who's going to write.

118
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,140
You're the one who's going to write.

119
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,140
That's where you're supposed to be.

120
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,140
That's where you're supposed to be.

121
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
That's where you're supposed to be.

122
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,140
Let's leave.

123
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,140
Bye.

124
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
You'll be a prisoner the next season.

125
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Let's meet again in an hour.

126
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Let's meet again in an hour.

127
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,140
Make it clean.

128
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Goodbye.

129
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Goodbye.

130
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
I'll be back with you.

131
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
I'll be back next week.

132
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,140
I'll be back three weeks in a row.

133
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Don't be silly.

134
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Let's go.

135
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,140
It was a lot of fun at the opening today.

136
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
What do you call that?

137
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
We've been doing it on this board.

138
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
We haven't been on location that often.

139
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140
It was a lot of fun.

140
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
It was a lot of fun.

141
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
But there was one more thing.

142
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,140
I wanted to do something like,

143
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
I love you at the door.

144
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
That's what I wanted to do.

145
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,140
That's what you wanted to do.

146
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,140
That's what I couldn't do.

147
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
I want you to see this.

148
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,140
But the staff here are really bad.

149
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,140
I'm really bad at it.

150
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,140
When the fireworks went off,

151
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
I was really satisfied.

152
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,140
What is this mayonnaise?

153
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Mayonnaise. Mayonnaise.

154
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,140
What am I supposed to do?

155
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,140
I'm going to throw it all out.

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
That's a little weird.

157
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,140
After that, it would be nice to have some vegetables.

158
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,140
I want to cut it so it's easy to eat.

159
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,140
I think it's okay to throw this in.

160
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
But sometimes,

161
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,140
What do you call that?

162
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,140
I can't teach you how scary your seniors are.

163
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
But I did a lot.

164
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
What?

165
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Today.

166
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
Well, I did it today.

167
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,140
I think I did a lot.

168
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,140
You can't be strict with your seniors.

169
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
Really?

170
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Oh, I was so angry the other day.

171
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
I went to my manager.

172
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
What do you call that?

173
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
That's too much.

174
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
He's an idiot.

175
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,140
That's not funny.

176
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Well, the other day,

177
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,140
We had a party.

178
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
I like the staff of Yume.

179
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,140
I went to karaoke.

180
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
After I went to Meiji-kun.

181
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
When I went to karaoke,

182
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,140
I drank a lot of alcohol.

183
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
I'm a pretty strong person.

184
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140
But that day was amazing.

185
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,140
It was amazing.

186
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
I said, yeah!

187
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,140
With that face and that outfit.

188
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,140
I sang Rebecca's Friends.

189
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,140
When Moonwalk came out,

190
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,140
I thought Nitta was coming.

191
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,140
But when I noticed, Nitta wasn't there.

192
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,140
I was wondering where he was.

193
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
I left him alone.

194
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
The manager, Tamura-kun.

195
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Nitta was down there.

196
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,140
I couldn't go.

197
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,140
You really wanted to go.

198
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Really?

199
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,140
I had to go see him.

200
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
Matsumoto-san, don't go.

201
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Matsumoto-san, don't go.

202
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Why?

203
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
He said, why?

204
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
I'll go.

205
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,140
Don't go. Please.

206
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Why?

207
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
I understand.

208
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,140
If you say that much,

209
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,140
It's okay to go.

210
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,140
Don't get angry.

211
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Don't get angry.

212
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Why would I get angry?

213
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
I don't get angry.

214
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,140
I don't get angry.

215
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
This is breaking.

216
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
I don't get angry because I know you're drunk.

217
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,140
I don't get angry.

218
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
I'm serious.

219
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,140
Don't get angry.

220
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
I know.

221
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I got out of the car.

222
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
I was shocked.

223
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
You were shocked.

224
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
I was shocked.

225
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,140
I was shocked.

226
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
I was shocked.

227
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,140
What is it? What is it?

228
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,140
That looks good too.

229
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,140
Look at my Kamaro's bonnet.

230
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,140
It has Nitta's shoulder.

231
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Do you want to see it later?

232
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,140
I was so angry.

233
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,140
I was so angry.

234
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Nitta opened her eyes.

235
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,140
I was wondering if she would apologize.

236
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,140
She said, I slept well.

237
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
You slept again.

238
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,140
You slept again with someone else's bonnet.

239
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,140
It feels good.

240
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,140
She is quiet in front of me.

241
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
But when I'm with her, she is quite reckless.

242
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,140
When we are with her, she suddenly talks.

243
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,140
She talks a lot.

244
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,140
That's good.

245
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm afraid of the power of alcohol.

246
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,140
What do you do with white vinegar?

247
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,140
After eating it?

248
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,140
If there is something like that.

249
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I eat it a lot.

250
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,140
You can eat it with a toothpick.

251
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,140
I don't eat that.

252
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,140
It's disgusting to put back something that came out of your mouth.

253
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,140
At that time, I put it in my mouth.

254
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,140
But if it comes out of my mouth, I eat it.

255
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,140
If it comes out of my toothpick, I eat it.

256
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,140
I eat it as a small dinner.

257
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,140
You eat it as a small dinner.

258
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140
I'm really hungry.

259
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Really?

260
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,140
I slept a while ago.

261
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
I was sleepy.

262
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Let's sing a lullaby.

263
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
You are good at singing.

264
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,140
I'm going to hit you.

265
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
Don't hit me.

266
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,140
That was a lullaby.

267
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,140
Don't sleep.

268
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
I thought so.

269
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,140
There is no one who sleeps during the show.

270
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
You are like a cat.

271
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
Really?

272
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
Let me touch you.

273
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,140
Meow.

274
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,140
Let me touch you.

275
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Why are you like a cat?

276
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
That's strange.

277
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
You are like a pigeon.

278
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Let me touch you.

279
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Let me touch you.

280
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Why?

281
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,140
Why can't I sing a lullaby?

282
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
The other day, I went to Tokyo Station.

283
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,140
There was a strange person.

284
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,140
He had a crash on his head.

285
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,140
When I came to him,

286
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I asked him to be my disciple.

287
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,140
Please be my disciple.

288
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Please be my disciple.

289
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Please be my disciple.

290
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Please be my disciple.

291
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Please.

292
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
I've been rejected by many people.

293
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Don't do that.

294
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140
Don't do that.

295
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,140
I've been rejected by many people.

296
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,140
I want to be a good disciple.

297
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,140
This time of the year is a lot.

298
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,140
I see.

299
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,140
I can't get a job or a new school.

300
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,140
What should I do?

301
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
I know that you are watching us.

302
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,140
You are longing for a star.

303
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
I understand.

304
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
You are taking a picture.

305
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,140
I'm not taking a picture.

306
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,140
No one is here.

307
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Why are you being so cautious?

308
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,140
I'm not taking a picture.

309
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Please write a letter.

310
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Please write a letter.

311
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Hama-chan.

312
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
Hama-chan.

313
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,140
You wanted an English lesson, so here I am.

314
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
Hello.

315
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Nice to meet you.

316
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,140
What did you say?

317
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Well.

318
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,140
You talked about our sponsor.

319
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
Yes.

320
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
I didn't say anything.

321
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
You didn't say anything?

322
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
Yes.

323
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,140
This is Jiyo-san.

324
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Yes.

325
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
She speaks English.

326
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
Yes.

327
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,140
She's doing this on purpose.

328
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Yes.

329
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,140
If you say you won't do anything, I'll bring her here.

330
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Please greet me in English.

331
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Please say something.

332
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
In English.

333
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
What do you mean?

334
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,140
I don't know.

335
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
I speak fast, so I understand.

336
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
What are you talking about?

337
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
No, no, no.

338
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Speak slowly.

339
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Speak slowly.

340
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
I understand, but I speak fast.

341
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Please say something in English to me.

342
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,140
You can speak Japanese?

343
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,140
Yes.

344
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
You can speak Japanese?

345
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Yes.

346
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,140
Your eye makeup is a bit tight.

347
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,140
What are you talking about?

348
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Can I ask you something?

349
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
I know most of it.

350
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Where are you from?

351
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Oh.

352
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
What?

353
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
I don't know.

354
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Give it back.

355
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
What?

356
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
I don't know.

357
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
I just know.

358
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
You're stupid.

359
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Give it back.

360
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
One more time.

361
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Yes.

362
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,140
Where are you from?

363
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,140
Where are you?

364
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,140
Who told you to repeat?

365
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,140
Speak slowly.

366
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,140
Where did you come from?

367
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:58,140
I didn't ask you where you came from.

368
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,140
I just wanted to know where the star lives.

369
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,140
You're a victim.

370
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Speak slowly.

371
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
I don't understand, but I understand what you said.

372
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Speak slowly.

373
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Nice to meet you.

374
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,140
Yes.

375
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,140
Nice to meet you.

376
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,140
If you're a white student like this, this is what it means.

377
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
What?

378
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Like this.

379
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Yes.

380
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:31,140
If you don't hold it hard, it'll be like this.

381
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
I see.

382
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Nice to meet you.

383
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Nice to meet you.

384
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
This is from Ibaraki.

385
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,140
This is from Hama-chan.

386
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Hello, Hama-chan.

387
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,140
I enjoy watching your show every week.

388
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Hama-chan is left-handed, right?

389
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Did you know that the life of a left-handed person is 9 years shorter than that of a right-handed person?

390
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,140
When I was watching TV at night, I was told that the life of a left-handed person is shorter.

391
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
I wanted to let you know right away, so I wrote it down.

392
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
But it's not too late.

393
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,140
If you want to live long, let's be right-handed right now.

394
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
I heard this, too.

395
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,140
Really?

396
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,140
It's 9 years early.

397
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
You're going to die?

398
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Yes.

399
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,140
A left-handed person is smarter.

400
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Really?

401
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,140
They use their left brain, so they're smarter.

402
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,140
They use their right brain, so they're smarter.

403
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Don't make fun of me.

404
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Are you right-handed?

405
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,140
You're more stupid than me.

406
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,140
They use their right brain, so they're smarter.

407
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Really?

408
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,140
If you follow this pattern, I'll die sooner.

409
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,140
That's true.

410
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
You're a left-handed person.

411
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,140
You live 9 years longer than me.

412
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,140
Really?

413
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,140
That's a lot.

414
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,140
That's how it is calculated.

415
00:16:49,140 --> 00:17:00,140
That means you have more sadness than I do.

416
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,140
What are you talking about?

417
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
What are you talking about?

418
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,140
What if I die 9 years later?

419
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
9 years is not a big deal.

420
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
What if I die when I'm 37?

421
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
It's not a big deal.

422
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,140
It's not a big deal.

423
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,140
I won't have a wife or children when I die.

424
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,140
There's nothing to do.

425
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,140
That's it.

426
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,140
But if you die in a few days, you'll think about it, won't you?

427
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
In a few days?

428
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
In a few days?

429
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
If it's 3 days, it's not a big deal.

430
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,140
If it's 3 days, I can do what I want to do.

431
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Really?

432
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
I can do that.

433
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,140
First of all, I eat a lot of delicious food on the first day.

434
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,140
You eat a lot of delicious food.

435
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,140
You're poor, so you don't know.

436
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,140
You're poor, too.

437
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm really poor.

438
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
I'm really poor.

439
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,140
But I have more money than you.

440
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,140
I have a lot of money.

441
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
I have more money.

442
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,140
I had a microwave.

443
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,140
I didn't have a microwave.

444
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,140
I had a steam iron.

445
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I had a pressure cooker.

446
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,140
I had a microwave.

447
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,140
I don't have a microwave.

448
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,140
I'm sorry. I lied.

449
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
I don't have a microwave.

450
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,140
I don't have a microwave.

451
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
What?

452
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,140
I told you, but when I get home, I put cold barley tea in the refrigerator.

453
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,140
It doesn't matter.

454
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Everyone does that in the summer.

455
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
You didn't have a microwave, did you?

456
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,140
I had a microwave.

457
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,140
Did you take coffee milk and milk properly?

458
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,140
I bought it and took coffee milk and milk.

459
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Really?

460
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Did you take Yakult?

461
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,140
Yakult is for children.

462
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
Why?

463
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
I don't know.

464
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Did you take vanilla essence?

465
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
You didn't take it, did you?

466
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,140
I didn't take anything, but I took vanilla essence.

467
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Why do you have it?

468
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,140
I had a snowy uniform.

469
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,140
Always?

470
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Always.

471
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Always?

472
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,140
Why did you go to the bathhouse?

473
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,140
You don't even have a bath.

474
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,140
You didn't take a bath before you got married.

475
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,140
You didn't go to the floor of my house like you did.

476
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:51,140
You didn't run like a mouse when you ate.

477
00:19:51,140 --> 00:20:03,140
I was hungry, so I didn't have any food to eat.

478
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Thank you.

479
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Don't cry.

480
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:14,140
You gave me a donut when I had a day off.

481
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,140
I was so upset when you said you would give me a donut.

482
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Good evening, Mr. Hamada.

483
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,140
I saw you on TV at Nisei Academy.

484
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
You went to a great school.

485
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
You were the vice principal.

486
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
Can you tell me about that time?

487
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
It's a normal school now.

488
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,140
It's not like that anymore.

489
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,140
You have long hair and you dress normally.

490
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,140
It's completely different from what we used to do.

491
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,140
You've been going to the dormitory for a long time, so you don't know anything about the world.

492
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,140
It's really interesting to see you when you come back from time to time.

493
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,140
I was surprised.

494
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,140
I went to school for the first time in six months.

495
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,140
I went home and played.

496
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
I was watching a singing show with you.

497
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,140
I was surprised to see you.

498
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Why is your face so dark?

499
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
He's like that.

500
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,140
I was wondering what he was doing.

501
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:20,140
I was surprised to see you with a fresh face.

502
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
Hey!

503
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,140
You have three colors!

504
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,140
I often hear the word explosion in the news program.

505
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,140
I was surprised to see you explode.

506
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,140
It happens once in a lifetime, doesn't it?

507
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Explosion!

508
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,140
I don't care about that.

509
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,140
You have too many colors.

510
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,140
It's the same as King's.

511
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,140
King's?

512
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,140
King's?

513
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,140
Who are you?

514
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Hello.

515
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Hello.

516
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,140
This is the neon tube I used in the previous set of this program.

517
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,140
This is all I have.

518
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
You didn't come to get this, did you?

519
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,140
It was a condition that I would definitely come to get it.

520
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
I'll give you a prize today.

521
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
I definitely want an electric sign.

522
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
It's not an electric sign, is it?

523
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
It's a neon sign.

524
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,140
I guess so.

525
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
What is this?

526
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
You called me without saying anything.

527
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
That's right.

528
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
I got it.

529
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,140
You called me.

530
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,140
I see.

531
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
This is Higashi Nobuhiko-kun in Chiba Prefecture.

532
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Or Yasugi Kiyoshi-kun.

533
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140
You're nervous now, aren't you?

534
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,140
That's right.

535
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,140
That's how you did it.

536
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Suzuki Miki-chan, 17 years old, from Matsudoshi.

537
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Let's give it to her.

538
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Shall we?

539
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Yes.

540
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Suzuki Miki-chan, this is for you.

541
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Please come to get the neon tube.

542
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,140
Congratulations.

543
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,140
We're going to do a game of dodgeball with 500 people versus 500 people.

544
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,140
The losing team will have to play a penalty game.

545
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,140
We're looking for a penalty game.

546
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
What does that mean?

547
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,140
A penalty game with 500 people.

548
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,140
If you have an idea, please send it to us.

549
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
And so on.

550
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
I'm not going to use you as a kid.

551
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
Only next year.

552
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Please.

553
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
That's right.

554
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Thank you.
