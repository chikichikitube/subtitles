00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara, Tsukitsuki, Dajare-yo, Gorou no Uchi wo Uchimakase!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good evening

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today's opening is Dajare-yo, Gorou no Uchi wo Uchimakase

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Why is everyone smiling like that?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First, let's introduce the challengers

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The challengers are here!

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Please sit down

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, that's it

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's introduce them

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
First, Murakami Shoji-san!

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Nice to meet you

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're confident in winning, right?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, but I'm also confident in losing

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And next to him, Dave Spector-san!

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to do my best as the American version of Wada Ben

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
American version of Wada Ben?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What about Dajare-yo?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't like Dajare kidnappers

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why don't you say it?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't care, but what is this jacket?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What is this?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What is this?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to say it, but I think it cost 10,000 yen at Shinjuku Pepe

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
10,000 yen?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And last but not least, Matsumoto Hisa-san!

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not very good at Dajare

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't like it!

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If I say Dajare, will you look at me with a normal face?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's like a king

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's have this person challenge

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is it a king?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Dajare-yo!

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Please give it up!

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Dajare-yo!

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dajare-yo!

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When did I start?

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We've been watching TV for a long time

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Dajare has been on many TV shows

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's wonderful!

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Today is the king's seat

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The chair here is a change

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe the chair will sit here

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is it okay to say that you're happy?

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For now, Goro-san

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But the seat is good

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's good, right? It's expensive

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's already in

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's already in!

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The seat is good!

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I didn't notice! I'm sorry!

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Dajare-yo!

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There are points and themes

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You have the right to choose one by one

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you choose one, you can say it one by one

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If someone chooses 20 points, can I eat it?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's right

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
After the three of you finish Dajare

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The king will say a word

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The person who says Dajare closer to the king gets one point

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Close

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know the criteria

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The king isn't wearing it right now

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's already in!

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's start with Shoji-san

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please choose

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's aim for a high score

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Animal number 10

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You have a high score

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm scared, it's difficult

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Animal number 10

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Elephant

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll go with elephant

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who are you?

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's elephant, not Dajare

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't think I can say it

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I got it!

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's elephant, not Dajare

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I see

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where do you want to bite?

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's elephant, not Dajare

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who said it's because it's a gag?

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's elephant, not Dajare

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You have to add elephant?

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Of course

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's the theme?

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go with this

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Elephant has a long nose

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's all a gag

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's all a gag

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What is the most popular food for an elephant?

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's elephant

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's better for this person

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think it's difficult

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
For example, when you're angry

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can't say it as a pro

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I can't say it

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's why I want to add it

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll give you this

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Give me that

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's all

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Please say something

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's an animal

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's easy

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not elephant

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's elephant

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's elephant

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I got it!

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please choose the theme

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go with 30

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
30 for talent

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's Izumi Pinko

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's Izumi Mito

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's Izumi Mito

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're making it up

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Shomi

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's Asadachi Pinko

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's Asadachi Pinko

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's Izumi

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's Izumi

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's Pinko

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's Izumi

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's Pinko

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's Izumi Pinko

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll do my best

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Please say something

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I got it

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is difficult

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you're a man, do it like a man

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do it like a man?

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's all

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please choose the theme

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Last one

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll give you 20

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
20

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't see

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What is it?

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Put your feet in

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What is it?

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But if you look at it from the bottom, the feet are flat

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you understand?

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The feet are flat

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I see

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Put your feet in

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Put your feet in

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Put your feet in

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Put your feet in

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Put your feet in

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Put your feet in

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
0 or 100

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're making a joke

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who said Ayu-e Osamu?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please say something

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll sing

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Put your feet in

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Put your feet in

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Shoji wins

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The final round

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's good

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Otokoro

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This brush is wonderful

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've been watching you since the time of KAKKURAGI

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is it

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't like this kind of ear cleaning

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Otokoro

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have a futon

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's good

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Otokoro

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know soap

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know soap

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's good

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's not good

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Goro

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Look at this mirror

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's good

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
As expected

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Goro

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Do you want to do it again?

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's good

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I got it

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ryu writer

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll do it as it is

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll do this

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Kebukamu

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I hate it

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
10 times Goya

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
As expected, the champion is Goro

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What is this?

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Light bulb

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ladies and gentlemen

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What is this?

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What is this?

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is the best way to start the show

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is this the first time?

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you talking about?

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That means

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It stinks

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It stinks

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It smells

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's the new year

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How many hours after the show ended?

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
6 hours

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
6 hours?

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
After 6 hours, there will be a punishment game

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The people who are watching this show know which one is the light bulb

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We don't know at this point

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
When that is decided

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hamada

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hamachan's punishment game

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's right

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Everyone, please watch

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't know which one is the light bulb

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't do it today

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Last year

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
At the end of the year

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The last bird was around this time

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
100 is a bit heavy

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They are always smiling

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No, no, no

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I felt bad when I came out

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No, this is

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
To be honest

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Hamada and Matsumoto are doing downtown

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When I came out

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The audience

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When there are a lot of Hamada fans

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There are a lot of Matsumoto fans

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It doesn't matter

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not good at all

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
When there are a lot of Hamada fans

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't like it

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not happy

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I expect Hamada's punch more than my punch

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What do you expect

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why did I notice that

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When I came out

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I punched him to make sure

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
At that time

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hamada is a Hamada person

255
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why do you decide

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Because he is a Hamada person

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So when my punch came out

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm not saying that

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I was laughing when I was punched

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But this

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No

263
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If Hamada comes out

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This audience

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's disgusting

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What are you doing

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's like an opera

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This audience is different

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This audience is different?

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This audience came to listen to the conversation

272
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It doesn't matter if you come out

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It doesn't matter

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If you come to listen to the conversation

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You laugh

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You laugh

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It doesn't matter

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The audience of Gaki

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's different

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
From the normal audience

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Even if you show it on other shows

282
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think it's just the people who can't accept it

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is just you

284
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's just you

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Even if you say bad things

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It doesn't matter

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Even if I say bad things

288
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They will laugh

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They will laugh

290
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They will laugh

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They will laugh

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
They will laugh

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In that sense

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a unique audience

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's a unique audience

296
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's not a unique audience

297
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's an audience that we have trained for years

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You mean

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It was terrible at first

300
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It was terrible

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It was terrible

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
At first

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Who are these people?

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's okay

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's okay

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's okay

307
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's okay

308
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's okay

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's okay

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's okay

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's okay

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's okay

313
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's okay

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's okay

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What? Is he happy?

316
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why did you do the same thing?

317
00:14:45,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I want you to blur all of this

318
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
You have to do the broadcast

319
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I can't do it!

320
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
The face you hid in front of me is like this

321
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
But what happens if you do the broadcast?

322
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Actually, if you do this

323
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Everyone doesn't know but

324
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,500
You can't do it if you do it in the dark

325
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
If you do it like that

326
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
You can't tell if it's a big deal

327
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's not like that

328
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
It's not like that

329
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Because it's like that

330
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
It's like a kid's s**t

331
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Why is it a kid's s**t?

332
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It's my s**t

333
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
It's a kid's s**t

334
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
It's a kid's s**t

335
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
But you can't change it like that

336
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
I can change it!

337
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I can change it!

338
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Is it okay if I shave my head?

339
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Then tell me

340
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Why is it a kid's s**t?

341
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Why is it a kid's s**t?

342
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Wait a minute

343
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Tell me that

344
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I think that

345
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
It's not good to watch

346
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
If you think about it

347
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
There's a kid next to you

348
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
This guy is shaving

349
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
You're shaving too

350
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
If you see it

351
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
You'll be surprised

352
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
You're an adult

353
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I want to shave my head

354
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
And shave my head

355
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
If I shave my head

356
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I can't change it like that

357
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
You don't have to shave your head

358
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
You don't have to shave your head

359
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
If you can do that

360
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
The width of your hair will widen

361
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
What width?

362
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I don't know why it's not good

363
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Why is it a kid's s**t and why is it not good for adults?

364
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
This is discrimination

365
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
If you say that it's a woman

366
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Why?

367
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
The baby boy is shaving a lot

368
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
It's not good for a girl

369
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
It's good

370
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
It's a boy and a small kid

371
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
It's not good for a girl and it's not good for adults

372
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
It's not good for a grandma

373
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
It's not good for a man

374
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I want to see a grandma

375
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
No!

376
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
I want to see a scary thing

377
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I want to see a smelly thing

378
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I don't know why it's not good for a girl

379
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Hey!

380
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I don't know why it's not good for a girl

381
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Why?

382
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
I'm going to die soon

383
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm going to die soon

384
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I don't like Japanese people

385
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
They are older than me

386
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
They are kids

387
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
They are animals

388
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
It's a hot spring

389
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
And food

390
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
If you do it on TV, the ratings will be good

391
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Hide-and-seek game

392
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
That's a number again

393
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
It's good

394
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Hey!

395
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Hey!

396
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
What I don't like is

397
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
There are special points

398
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
That's right

399
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Let's look at the special points

400
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
10 points, 9 points, 8 points, 10 points, 9 points

401
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I don't use 2 points

402
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
If it's like this, let's make the whole triangle a square

403
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I see

404
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Why is the whole triangle a square?

405
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Why is the whole triangle a square?

406
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Sorry

407
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Sorry

408
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
This kid

409
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Sorry

410
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
This kid is a genius

411
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Something

412
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Right?

413
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
He came out

414
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
He is a genius

415
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
What is it?

416
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't know

417
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
This genius

418
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
This kid

419
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
What is it?

420
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
What are you saying?

421
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I lost sight of him

422
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I lost sight of him here

423
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Don't go there

424
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
What is it?

425
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
10 points, 9 points, 8 points, 10 points, 9 points

426
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Next, soccer genius

427
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
That's enough

428
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Soccer genius and soccer kid

429
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
They are different

430
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
That's a different thing

431
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
That's a different thing

432
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Soccer genius wins

433
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Soccer genius

434
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Soccer genius

435
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
That's enough

436
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Next question

437
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Question

438
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
What is the punch in Punch Parma?

439
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Does it mean the same as the punch in John and Punch?

440
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
That's not true

441
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,500
When you translate punch into Japanese

442
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
It means

443
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
No, it's true

444
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
It's the sound you make when you punch

445
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
No, no, no

446
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
It's all the same

447
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Punch Parma

448
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Parma

449
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Potato chips

450
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Consomme punch

451
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Consomme aura

452
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Consomme aura

453
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
It's punch

454
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Punch means aura

455
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
A date with punch

456
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
A date with aura

457
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
That's scary

458
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
It means let's go on a date

459
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
What are you saying?

460
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
No, no, no

461
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
What is he saying?

462
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Punch is an aura

463
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
That's a lie

464
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
It's punch

465
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
When you say that, I feel like that

466
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
What I'm saying is not a lie

467
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
You used to do punch kick

468
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Punch kick

469
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
With a toy

470
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Yes, yes, yes

471
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
If you say it's an aura, it means it's an aura

472
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,500
All punches are an aura

473
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Chimpanzee

474
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
That's not true

475
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
That's not true

476
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm saying punch

477
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Osmo Quiz Part 2

478
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I used to do Osmo Quiz once

479
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Osmo Quiz Part 2

480
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Yay, yay, yay

481
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,500
The peace treaty and the Sarajevo agreement have been settled

482
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Which one will win?

483
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Thinking time

484
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Osmo, I will defeat you

485
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
The answer is the peace treaty and the Sarajevo agreement

486
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Yay, yay, yay

487
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Part 2

488
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Osmo Quiz Part 2

489
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Which one will win?

490
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Thinking time

491
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Osmo, I will defeat you

492
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
The answer is the peace treaty and the Sarajevo agreement

493
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Yay, yay, yay

494
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Do you want to go home?

495
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
It's a bit tight

496
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Let's take a close-up

497
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
5 seconds

498
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
4, 3, 2

499
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
What?

500
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Hey!

501
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm sorry

502
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
4, 3, 2

503
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
You should say Kan

504
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,500
You shouldn't say Kan to the camera

505
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:27,500
You should say Kan
