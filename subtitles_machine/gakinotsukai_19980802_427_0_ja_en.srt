1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi's famous song, Taxi Driver, was made in Sokkyo.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This song, which brings back the mood of the early Showa period, is currently used as a talk show.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But at first, Matsumoto said something like this.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not the type of person who sings by myself.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I see.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm the type of person who provides to others.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Even if you're watching this program,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Who do you want me to come to?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Anyone is fine.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is the recording of Matsumoto Hitoshi's famous song, Taxi Driver.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Finally, the day has come.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Finally.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I went to the toilet and peed.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I have a tingling sensation.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's bad.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It doesn't matter. Let's do our best.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Finally.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't want to lean on you.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Finally, a musician.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Really?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Taxi Driver has nothing to do with Debaishi.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At first, when I came to the opening, the audience was excited.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's getting more and more autumn.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's early.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Last week, the audience didn't laugh at all.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So this time, I'm going to make a decision.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll have someone else do it.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's have him on the stage.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Please welcome this person.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's Sharankyu.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This time, he's going to sing.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sharankyu is a unique group of musicians.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What kind of song will it be?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Osaka is a comic book.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't be happy.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mako's eyes are swimming today, too.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mako, you don't have to come here.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to record drums today.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't want to fight.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm glad to hear that.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Have you heard of it?

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've heard of it.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've prepared it.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's hear it again.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's use this device.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The sound of the prelude and the beginning of the song are completely different.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's so good.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's a lot of relaxation here.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Komuro is a manager who can be used.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to use Komuro.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to use Komuro.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to use Komuro.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm going to use Komuro.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you see.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's do it.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please do this.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please do it.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why?

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Who are you?

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Who are you?

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who are you?

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who are you?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you excited?

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Listen to me.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Who are you?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Who are you?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Who are you?

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Who are you?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who are you?

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Who are you?

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yamazaki.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who are you?

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yamazaki, I'm sorry.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a song.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey, you guys.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you making us sing?

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why are you so arrogant?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you want to die?

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What do you mean?

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How many years have you been doing this?

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You guys are a lot.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How many years have you been doing this?

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you want to die?

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm asking for a taxi driver.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't let such a cheap guy do it.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Who are you?

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What do you want to do?

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why are you making us sing?

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why don't you let Yamazaki sing?

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Is that so?

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We want to sing for three people.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm a regular singer.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not a regular singer.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You guys are making fun of me.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's not true.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're a musician.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's not true.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're a musician.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Was there such a joke?

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't you know?

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Look at me.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go to the theater.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm thinking about going to the theater.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's go to the theater.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you saying?

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't make you sing.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can't make you sing.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You are fast.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You are fast.

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BOROME!

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
NARUTO!

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's true.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's really low.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You have a lot of moves.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, let's do this.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please decide which one has more talent.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We're going to compete now.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please decide which one has more talent.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It doesn't matter if it's funny or not.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're going to compete.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's compete!

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's go!

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Who should we choose?

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why are you doing this?

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Tell us the truth.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We don't know what to do.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you don't tell us, we don't know who to choose.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's true.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We don't know who to choose.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We don't know.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We're going to compete with the three of us.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The one who wins this competition, please sing.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Please sing.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The one who wins has to choose.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then, shall we have him choose?

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Of course.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's do that.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll buy his passion.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You have to say that.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's why.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's why.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm the cute one.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Makoto!

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're going to compete.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a high tension competition!

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is it!

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What is it?

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
After I showed you this, you said it's a high tension competition.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a high tension competition.

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who will be the winner?

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You did it again.

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is annoying.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is hard.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll sing!

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm counting on you!

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you know the rhythm of the samba?

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why doesn't anyone know?

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you're the winner,

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
who will be the winner?

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hyoil did it three times.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Can you do it?

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you do it, Makoto?

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Watch me.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do your best.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Can you do it?

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm leading.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm doing it.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm leading.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What was that?

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is a high tension competition.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's make a decision.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a high tension competition.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What is it?

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to compete.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Go!

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to compete.

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is a high tension competition.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who is it?

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Taisei!

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's me.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Taisei and Makoto are competing.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Who will get the right to sing?

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you win,

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
we'll get the right to sing.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can decide that?

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The judge is here.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The judge is here.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is it?

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What is it?

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What is it?

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going to sing.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ready, start!

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Taisei is strong.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It hurts.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It hurts when it flies.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
How much does it stretch?

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
More, more.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why are you using rubber?

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Taisei is strong.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It hurts.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What is it?

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Where did you go?

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't decide.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You have to turn around.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Taisei is strong.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a high tension competition.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's amazing.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's amazing.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's amazing.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's amazing.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's hard to decide.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In the end,

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to sing.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's me.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
My competition is

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
me and my character,

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hatake.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's been a while.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Both leaders,

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yamazaki and Hatake,

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
will decide the winner.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What is this?

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Soccer.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Stop it.

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is really amazing.

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to start.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What are you going to do?

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What is this?

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
APJ!

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's why you're

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
a Brazilian

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
craftsman.

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a skill.

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a skill.

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Stop it.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hatake, try it.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Who's going to do it?

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm not going to do it.

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There's more.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't treat me like this.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Next.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm going to do it.

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you okay?

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Look at this.

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is amazing.

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm scared.

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go.

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's not broken at all.

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's broken on the ground.

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's great.

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The atmosphere is different.

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No matter how many times we do it,

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
it's still the atmosphere.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's great.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The last match.

265
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There's more.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There's more?

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Wari basuke.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is it?

269
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Wari basuke.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wari basuke.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Anyone can do it.

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Anyone can do it.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a fun service.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a fun service.

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What's the difference?

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What's the difference?

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What's the difference?

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a private lobby.

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wari basuke.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please make a decision.

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll make a decision.

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think you already know this.

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sharankyu wins.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why did you do your best?

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why did you decide on Sharankyu?

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's nothing like that.

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The recording is about to begin.

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's check the lyrics and the song.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's about time.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm counting on you guys.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm counting on you guys.

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why are you so proud?

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I tried to do my best.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I tried to do my best.

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I tried to do my best.

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I tried to do my best.

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I tried to do my best.

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Up to here, it's la la la la.

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Who's going to do this?

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
la la la la

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Everyone?

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Except for Tsunku?

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Except for Tsunku?

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll start with Tsunku.

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll start with Tsunku.

307
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll start with Tsunku.

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ito is a taxi driver.

309
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ito is a taxi driver.

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You can go straight in.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can go straight in.

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Close the car door.

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Close the car door.

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm going to be the driver.

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm going to be the driver.

316
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a taxi company in Kyoto.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's a third one.

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He puts in gear and attention.

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He puts in gear and attention.

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He's a taxi driver.

321
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He's a taxi driver.

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
la la la la

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Why are you going there?

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Lovers are...

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's like a taxi driver singing to his lover.

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Lovers are around here.

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The lyrics are coming in.

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Japanese after the war is like this.

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is an instruction.

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll record it.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Please give me an instruction.

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The lyrics are like this.

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The basic lyrics are like this.

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If you don't do it perfectly, you have to sing it at the concert.

335
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have to sing this at the tour.

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll sing this at the beginning of the opening.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll sing this twice at the encore.

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll sing this twice at the encore.

339
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll sing this three times in total.

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll sing this twice at the encore.

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll sing this.

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's do it.

343
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They are playing the guitar.

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
They check the keys.

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The field is in a bad condition.

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What's wrong with this?

347
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is interesting.

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I tried to play the guitar in the field.

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He is serious.

350
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's listen to the original song.

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
One more time.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Where is the master?

353
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Look at this.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This is cool.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is a field.

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Really?

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He is a great man.

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is a field.

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is a field.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This reminds me of GOKUTSUMA.

361
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He is singing.

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
SHARANKYU.

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What's going on?

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm checking the lyrics of the song.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I've never seen this before.

367
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll play it again.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I see.

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It takes time.

370
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't ruin my image.

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think I should start from the 3rd bar.

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I think I should start from the 3rd bar.

375
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Which one?

376
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I think I should start from the 3rd bar.

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't know.

378
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This is the first part.

379
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Please play it.

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I was the strongest.

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's not true.

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He is a great man.

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

385
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

386
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Can I ask you about your image?

387
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What?

388
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What is your final image?

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I want to be democratic.

390
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You want to be democratic?

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Leader.

392
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Leader.

393
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I know.

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What?

395
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I want to be democratic.

396
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What is your final image?

397
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What is your final image?

398
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He is a taxi driver.

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This one?

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He is a taxi driver.

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think I should start from the 3rd bar.

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Mr. Azaki.

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This sound.

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I got it.

407
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's not the sound.

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This sound.

409
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I got it.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's a little different.

411
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Matsui, can you play it?

412
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's difficult.

413
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's difficult to sing.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This is difficult.

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

416
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know.

417
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

418
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

419
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
F7.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This is F7.

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This is F7.

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's hard.

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's hard.

424
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's hard.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can't move it.

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I can't move it.

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's hard.

428
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He can't hide his confusion.

430
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He seems to be struggling.

431
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is B flat minor.

432
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I got it.

433
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
OK.

434
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Minor.

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Minor.

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Let's change it to minor.

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you.

438
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you.

439
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

440
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I got it.

441
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

442
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

443
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

445
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
All OK.

447
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You're fast.

448
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Thank you.

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's it.

450
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Really?

451
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes.

452
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It was a little strange.

453
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Basically, try it.

455
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I got it.

456
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

457
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

458
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

460
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Matsui, can you play the F7 in the 6th bar?

461
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Believe in yourself.

463
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Next week, we're finally going to see the taxi driver car basketball version complete.

464
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Look forward to it.
