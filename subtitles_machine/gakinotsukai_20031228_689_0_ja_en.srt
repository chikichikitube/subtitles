1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Getsu! Getsu! Getsu!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you for your hard work this year as well. Today is the end of the year special project. We will be giving away the opening VTR best 10 of the 2003 Gaki no Tsukai.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This year, the former downtown manager, Fujiwara Hiroshi, has been chosen as the host for 6 consecutive years. His name is Dandy Fujiwara.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Getsu! Getsu! Getsu! Getsu! Getsu! Getsu!

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is all-star, isn't it? This is all-star, isn't it?

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's almost the end of the year, but this year, to celebrate, Tanaka-san got married, and Endo-san gave birth to a child.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll leave the first part to you. Why? Wait a minute. Stop it! Right? It's still Yama-chan's birthday. It's cold. Stop it!

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm the one who's suffering the most. I'll do the things that aren't done in advance.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As an entertainer, even when he's drunk, he has to run on stage to perform a sudden attack on Momotaro while drinking. However...

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Isn't that water? I can't stand this guy. I think the people who watch Yama-chan on TV are cold. They act like they're not drunk, but they're drunk.

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've seen it many times. It's cold in Yamazaki.

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Grandma! Grandma! Who was it? Was it Masuda-san? Then I'll do it too.

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm the one who's drunk. I'll do it next time.

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Since the drama was so bad, he changed his role and tried again. But his appearance was so bad that he couldn't be called a play.

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is our child, Momotaro.

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then let's open this Kimi Dango.

18
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Momotaro, bring the dog.

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't remember my grandma doing it.

20
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't remember my grandma doing it.

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The 9th place is this project that Hamada went to the radio stock with a punishment game.

22
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't like this.

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What is it?

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey, how long have you been waiting?

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're so noisy.

26
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know because I was told to come here.

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're so noisy.

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're the one who told me to come here.

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You said you were going to beat Rajimel.

30
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're so noisy.

31
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

32
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're so noisy.

33
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know because I was told to come here.

34
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know because I was told to come here.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know because I was told to come here.

36
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know because I was told to come here.

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The 9th place is the entertainment fishing competition held once a year.

38
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just like every year, a hot fishing battle has been held with a luxurious crowd.

39
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,000
This time, the two of them are close friends and did not catch a single fish.

40
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who will be the winner?

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The winner is...

42
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Tamayama Tenryu!

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The winner is Tamayama Tenryu!

44
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The 7th place is Shogeki Kokuhaku Omoide Byokan.

45
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The person who turns the cards and hits the person who is talking has to confess the topic as their own experience group.

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right!

47
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My memories are good, right?

48
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why did you do that?

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not easy.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know, I...

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I covered my face with ice hockey.

52
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Who?

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Me, me, me.

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When you were a kid?

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When I was a kid, yes.

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But recently...

57
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Recently?

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why?

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why?

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I was so excited.

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I covered my face with ice hockey and then with my eyes like this...

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I killed him.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You shouldn't do that.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're a pervert.

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're a pervert.

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Who? Who?

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The guy who was there.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The guy who was there.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't like that.

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That was last month...

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, on Friday, the 13th.

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You did it?

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
There was a new one.

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was surprised.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Momotaro.

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes?

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You were sleeping when you met your grandma, right?

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who is this guy?

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Was it really me?

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You don't remember that?

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You didn't move at all.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You didn't talk.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I really want to go home.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to do it again.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It was delicious.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Anyone can come on Friday the 13th.

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't want to talk about the past.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's hard to talk about the past.

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right?

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right?

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Get it!

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I thought this was going to be delicious.

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This project was made by the five of them.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All of them will eat what they made.

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yamasaki made a meal with yogurt, banana, and nata de coco.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going to eat it.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What is this?

101
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not going to eat this.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll eat it.

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's hot.

104
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's hot.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why is it so hot?

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What kind of comment is that?

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tell me the taste.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's so hot.

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not burnt.

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Eat the soft part.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Really?

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is it bad?

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What kind of comment is that?

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's hell.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hell?

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm really sorry.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's like Ultraman when you hate it and want to go home.

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This happened while the five of them were eating delicious ramen.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going to eat it.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you doing?

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you doing?

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I hate it.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You hate it?

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What kind of comment is that?

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're a rude woman.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He regained his mind and went to another ramen shop.

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But...

129
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Can you stop the car?

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Why?

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What are you doing?

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He's running.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He's running.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's running.

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's running.

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What are you doing?

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you.

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's running.

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Stop it.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Stop it.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Stop it.

144
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Stop it.

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Stop it.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Stop it.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stop it.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Stop it.

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because it's dangerous for an adult to fight on his own,

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Matsumoto's suggestion is to exercise hard with a rune runner,

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and then play against Nyu-san.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The result will be decided by the Nyu-san battle.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Matsumoto vs. Nyu-san

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I hate it.

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't let your guard down.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't let your guard down.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't let your guard down.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's right.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Matsumoto vs. Nyu-san

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The high-speed rotating group was defeated last year,

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and this year a new one has been released.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The first opponent is the strong opponent, the Ota professional team.

163
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Matsumoto vs. Nyu-san

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Matsumoto vs. Nyu-san

165
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Go, go, go.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is the real deal.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is the real deal.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Seriously.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Everyone, try it.

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the real deal.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You think it's a joke, don't you?

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're wrong.

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Matsumoto vs. Nyu-san

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The strong opponent is Hamada, who has defeated the strong opponent.

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Will he be able to win?

176
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you do it 38 times, you win.

177
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I see.

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If you do it 37 times, you get the same score.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm already at the limit of 50.

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's do it.

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's do it.

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Ready.

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Start.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm counting on you.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's win.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
One.

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know at all.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know what to do.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know what to do.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm going to do it.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What?

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What?

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
60.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not going to do it anymore.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, yes, yes.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I can speak.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What?

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is great.

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm at the limit of 50.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I just kept going.

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The counter...

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't do it.

207
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can't do it.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I can't do it.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't do it.

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't do it.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't do it.

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll go this way.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I can do it.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can do it.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's fast!

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is amazing.

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's fast!

218
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's fast!

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's fast!

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's really fast.

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's fast!

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's fast!

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's fast!

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's cheating!

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's fast!

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's fast!

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Amazing!

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Even if you fight against any team, you can win.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I can definitely win.

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
As long as Hamagawa-san is there.

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
As long as he's there.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He can definitely win.

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He can definitely win.

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Even if it's 500 times, he can win.

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, it can't be 500 times.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not 100 times, so it's the same.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, no, no, no, no.

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, it can't be.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It can't be.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's really good.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's really good.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is the project Hamada happened to see in the newspaper.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He went to catch a huge anago in the Tokyo Bay.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There's a big one in the middle.

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There's a big one in the middle.

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But it wasn't easy to catch it because the opponent was there.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How many minutes have passed since you dropped it?

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The anxiety of the five began to creep in.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
At that time.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think it's coming.

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Not yet.

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's coming.

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Put it here.

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not coming.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's coming.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's not coming.

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's coming.

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's coming.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Go, go, go.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hurry up and lose.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
My head hurts.

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's big.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Wait a minute.

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're good.

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're good.

266
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's coming.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's coming.

268
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's coming.

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's big.

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's amazing.

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's still a baby.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
As the sun went down, huge anago came one after another.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's heavy.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's heavy.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's heavy.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's heavy.

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's heavy.

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's heavy.

279
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's heavy.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's heavy.

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's heavy.

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's heavy.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's heavy.

284
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's heavy.

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's heavy.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's why I went.

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's the end.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's the end.

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Is that so?

290
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's amazing.

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's amazing.

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's amazing.

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's amazing.

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's hard.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's hard.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's dry.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's hard.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's hard.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't get the rice out.

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How did you eat this?

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's heavy.

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's heavy.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's why I went.

304
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There is a festival in the book.

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Women's festival.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm not laughing.

307
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What?

308
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What are you looking at?

309
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm not laughing.

310
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not laughing.

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm not laughing.

312
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not laughing.

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm not laughing.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm not laughing.

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Please get a hold of yourself.

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Ok?

317
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Well...

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well...

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Well...

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well...

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I know!

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm so sorry!

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm so sorry!

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm so sorry!

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I tried to fix it many times.

326
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I failed many times.

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well...

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well...

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The gross man like you,

330
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The gross man like you,

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It was prepared by Hamada-san.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What the fuck are you?

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What the fuck are you?

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're so...

335
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're so...

336
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're so...

337
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You're so...

338
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You're so...

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Please sum it up. I'll wait for one more time.

340
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hamada-san is really...

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He's going to beat Kitahanki.

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Anyway, the show is ready.

343
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is it.

344
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yamasaki.

345
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I can't do it.

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Itacho wants to say hello, is that okay?

347
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Itacho.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can't do it.

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yamasaki is out.

350
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If there is anything you want to say about the show, please say it.

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is...

352
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What should I say?

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know.

354
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Say something.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Just once.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't get angry just because I used the eraser.

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's because you used the eraser.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yamasaki is out.

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Tonight is Yamada.

360
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Tonight is Yamada.

361
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Tonight is Yamada.

362
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Tonight is Yamada.

363
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Tonight is Yamada.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's funny no matter where you film it.

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yamada is always so stubborn.

366
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He always says that he won't laugh.

367
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He's always like that.

368
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If he gets proposed to, he'll say yes.

369
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He's always like that.

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
2003.

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We can't talk about this guy without him.

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Heikou, the main character of Gaki no Tsukai.

373
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He's back on the scene this year.

374
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
For the third time, Heikou was exposed to the fear of the haunted house.

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm not a ghost.

376
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He was sentenced to death by the human breaker.

377
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm scared.

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm scared.

379
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Someone help me.

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Peppo.

381
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Peppo.

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He's not here.

383
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Where are you?

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This happened when Yamada came to drink beer at the Hiroshima Carp next year.

386
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I feel like I'm going to drown.

387
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What are you doing?

388
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I didn't do anything to anyone.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What is Peppo going to do next year?

390
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Peppo is number one.

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What do you think?

392
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
How old are you?

393
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm going to be 50 this year.

394
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm scared of ghosts, so please forgive me.

395
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What do you think of Peppo?

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm scared, so I can't help it.

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

398
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think it's natural.

399
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's natural to be on TV.

400
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's hard.

401
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It feels like the 4th generation of the NAC.
