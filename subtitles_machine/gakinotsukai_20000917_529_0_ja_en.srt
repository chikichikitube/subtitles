1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good morning.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good morning.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's wrong?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's wrong?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please help me.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are you looking at?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's wrong?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You know I'm here.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You know I'm here.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You know I'm here.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Really?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, for now, I'm going to...

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to watch a video.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to watch a video.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think you know what I mean.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think you know what I mean.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's all you have to say?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's all you have to say?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's all you have to say?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's all you have to say?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a three-piece.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I almost died.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I almost died.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I almost died.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
forests

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I still got it.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I still got it.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I still got it.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Huh?

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's obviously my name, isn't it?

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My name is obviously.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My name is obviously.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That sp Kanal?

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's still not it at all, is it?

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's obvious that my name is Uteru, and so is my face.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's like Uteru, isn't it?

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But you can tell by the way I talk and the way I move.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And it's my intuition, but I think that was 7 or 8 years ago.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you saying that now?

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, I don't know if it was 7 or 8 years ago, but that's fine, isn't it?

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think it was 7 or 8 years ago.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll go back in time.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll go back in time.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You still have a long way to go.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You still have a long way to go.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You still have a long way to go.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sure you all have a long way to go, so you probably don't remember anything.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To be honest, I don't remember anything from that conversation.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I hope you'll do something about it.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But it's a bit strange that you said,

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't draw Itao.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's strange, and it makes me feel sad.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I felt like I didn't like it when I saw it on air.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You didn't say anything?

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I thought I'd put up with it, but I'm still angry.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're angry today?

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're angry today?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're angry today?

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But it's okay if it's just a footnote.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mr. Sugata.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes?

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is it okay?

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I guess so.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's better to talk.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
To be honest, when this door opened, I thought it was money.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's all I have.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's all I have.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is this okay today?

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay?

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Excuse me.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Before the talk.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Excuse me.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you for your hard work.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you for your hard work.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's fast.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's fast.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're in a hurry.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I was looking at the clock over there.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was worried.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where are you going with the money?

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Where are you going?

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's put it on.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really?

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll put it on.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm nervous.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm nervous.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What kind of feeling do you usually have?

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm interested.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you see.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think it's related to this place.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's good.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's good.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I found it.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did you find it?

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I found it.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where is it?

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I found it.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's dangerous.

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's Yutty.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's slow.

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's right.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Where are you going?

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's get off.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's strange.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is amazing.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's hard to get.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's hard to get.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's delicious.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's a big print.

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yutty's face is big.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's peeking into someone's house.

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go in.

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's a person's house.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a person's house.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a dog.

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a dog.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are you doing?

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What are you doing?

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you doing?

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Takayama.

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The dog is running away.

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The dog is running away.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Look at this.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you very much.

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I caught it.

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you very much.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's about 10,000 to 20,000 yen.

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think it was looking for a house with a dog.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

139
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's why it's purring.

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why it's purring.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a scam.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a scam.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's terrible.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The shutter is closed, but the dog doesn't run away.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I caught it.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I caught it.

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I caught it.

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mr. Hamada.

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The dog is running away.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's here.

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you very much.

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please be careful.

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's amazing.

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's right.

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's 20,000 yen just for this.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's amazing.

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Before that, I brought my hair to Suwa.

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right.

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I was worried of the dog running away.

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a cash dispenser.

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think it's a drug.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's a drug.

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm worried, too.

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm worried, too.

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I saw who was doing what.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Really?

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you know that?

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Someone is coming.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It does not matter what people say.

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I see.

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Huh?

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Is that a plastic bottle?

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's full of trash.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a plastic bottle.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, it is.

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I see.

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can't buy plastic bottles with money.

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can't.

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Unless it's a big one.

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's full of trash.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Where is it?

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's in the park.

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There it is.

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is it in?

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's in.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a child.

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's a child.

191
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a child.

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's a child?

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

194
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a child.

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There it is.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's full of trash.

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's full of trash.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's full of trash.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Huh?

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a shrimp.

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's full of trash.

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Huh?

203
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Thank you very much.

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're my father.

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I know you're doing this at home.

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course.

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let me see.

208
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're very nice.

209
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's moving a lot.

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What should we do?

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go home.

212
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's give the child.

213
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's give the child.

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's give the child.

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's go home.

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Good luck.

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It says half price for the shrimp.

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It says half price for the shrimp.

219
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No.

220
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not a shrimp.

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
This is annoying!

222
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,660
You are cute.

223
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,340
Where are you going to sell this?

224
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:31,800
такое

225
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I don't know if it was profitable when it was cheap

226
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,800
It's harder to sell than it is to sell

227
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
It's in

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
What is this?

229
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
What is a kid's shop?

230
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
What is this?

231
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
End of version import

232
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
It says it's certified

233
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
It says it's selling competitive materials

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
But it's different from Kejiran

235
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,800
It says it's cold

236
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,800
I don't think I've ever seen a woman like this

237
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Where are you going?

238
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Where are you going?

239
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Are you going home by bicycle?

240
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
What kind of shop is this?

241
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
What kind of shop is this?

242
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Don't show it

243
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I haven't seen it yet

244
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm going to catch up

245
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I can't do that

246
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
He ran away

247
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
It's been raining a lot

248
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I thought I lost it

249
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Isn't that Mr. Ito?

250
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
The white car

251
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
You

252
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Isn't that the white car?

253
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
But it's not a bicycle

254
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
It's Mr. Ito

255
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
It's not a bicycle

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I know that situation

257
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I haven't seen it

258
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Shall we go?

259
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Shall we go?

260
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I got hit

261
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Look at this

262
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
License

263
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800
It's a young comedian's license

264
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Really?

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Isn't that BAKANA?

266
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
BAKANA

267
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Did you shoot BAKANA?

268
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
BAKANA

269
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
He said he spilled the stew

270
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's a stew again

271
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
It's the same as the first time

272
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I was hit a lot

273
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I was hit

274
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Look at this

275
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
It's the same situation

276
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Did it fall?

277
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
It fell

278
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
It fell

279
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
It fell

280
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Be careful

281
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
He said be careful

282
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
It's fast

283
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,800
They are following Mr. Ito

284
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Finally, the secret of Mr. Ito will be revealed

285
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Mr. Ito

286
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I found it

287
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Did you find it?

288
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I found it

289
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I found it

290
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

291
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

292
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm sure I saw it

293
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Where is it?

294
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
It's here

295
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
It's a bench

296
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
It's broken

297
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,800
It's easy to understand

298
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
There are many

299
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
What is it?

300
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
I don't know

301
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
That's Mr. Ito's chair

302
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
It's a chair

303
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
He threw the umbrella

304
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Where is it?

305
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I don't know

306
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,800
It's a fan

307
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I see

308
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
What is it?

309
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
They are collecting money

310
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Is it an organ?

311
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes

312
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I see

313
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Is it an organization?

314
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
They are friends

315
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
What kind of organization is it?

316
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
It's Mr. Ito

317
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
He is collecting money

318
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
It looks like Mr. Ito

319
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
It's not enough

320
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
It's not enough

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
What is it?

322
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
It's broken

323
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I saw it

324
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
It's a fan

325
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
It's a fan

326
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,800
It's a fan

327
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
It's not enough

328
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Let's do it

329
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
It's broken

330
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,800
It's broken

331
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
It's broken

332
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I saw it

333
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Where did you see it?

334
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,800
It hurts

335
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,800
It hurts

336
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I got hit on my neck

337
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Why did you run away?

338
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Are you OK?

339
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I got hit on my neck

340
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Why did you run away?

341
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
It doesn't move

342
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Why are you standing on the edge?

343
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
It's like a game character

344
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,800
If you don't touch the controller, it won't move

345
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Mr. Ito

346
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Don't fall in love with me

347
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Hamada's ear

348
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,800
The wind is blowing

349
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Thank you

350
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I was listening to Kokoriko for a while

351
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
It was like a dry laughing

352
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
It wasn't like that

353
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I was laughing because of my aura

354
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Your aura is different

355
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,800
It's coming out like a person

356
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Can you see it?

357
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
It's coming out like this

358
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
It's coming out like this

359
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,800
It's not good if it falls

360
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
It's like a man who slides with his aura

361
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
It's like a liquid

362
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I understand

363
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I won't talk anymore

364
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
The weather is bad

365
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
It's raining

366
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
It's not good

367
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,800
In Japan, it rains with this hand

368
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
I can't go to the garden except for the rainy season

369
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I don't know why it's raining in the fall

370
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I'll try to change the name

371
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I won't talk anymore

372
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I have something to say

373
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Everyone is looking at me with a kind face

374
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,800
It's like Matsumoto is talking too much

375
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I can't feel the atmosphere

376
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I want Hamada to talk too

377
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
It's not talking too much

378
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
What is Matsumoto talking about?

379
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Is it that?

380
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I was curious about that

381
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
There's nothing

382
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Are you really going to win?

383
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm not interested in baseball

384
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,800
What did I say when baseball started this year?

385
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm a huge fan from today

386
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Did you say a huge fan?

387
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I said I was a huge fan from this year

388
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Did you say that?

389
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I said that

390
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
That's right

391
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm feeling down right now

392
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm very excited

393
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
How was today's game?

394
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Today's game was good

395
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I didn't think it was that good

396
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
It was good

397
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Do you know where you played today?

398
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,800
I played with the other 11 baseball teams

399
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
That's what baseball is about

400
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
It doesn't matter where you play today

401
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
It doesn't matter

402
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I don't know if I won or not

403
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
You're playing with a team other than yours

404
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Then who are you playing with?

405
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Are you playing individually?

406
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,800
You're playing thinking everyone else is your enemy

407
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
That's right but

408
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Where is today's enemy?

409
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
What is today's enemy?

410
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
What is today's enemy?

411
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
What is today's side dish?

412
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I don't know

413
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Listen to me

414
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Why are you listening to me?

415
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I heard that you lost your mind 3 times when you were a kid

416
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Can you tell us what happened?

417
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,800
To be honest, it was when I was in the first grade of elementary school

418
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Why are you so young?

419
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Then why did you lose your mind?

420
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,800
When I saw you

421
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Why? You were a first grader

422
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I was really surprised

423
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Why?

424
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Why were you surprised when you saw me?

425
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
What kind of season was that?

426
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I heard that you were in elementary school

427
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
I think I've said this before but I was in Pantano

428
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Pantano is in G-Pantano

429
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
It's in Bellevue

430
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Bellevue wasn't half bad

431
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,800
You might think it's a lie but it's wider than U.S.T.

432
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Bellevue isn't like that

433
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I was in Clipper

434
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Wait, wasn't that a vertical roll?

435
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
It was a vertical roll

436
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Do I have long hair like this?

437
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I was in a vertical roll so I can't lie

438
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,800
You had something like an instrument

439
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Isn't that the same thing as a snufkin?

440
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Snufkin is a guitar, right?

441
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
No, you had something like an instrument

442
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
What's an instrument?

443
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Something like a marimba

444
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
That's not it

445
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
You had something like a harp

446
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I was surprised and I got scared

447
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Oh really?

448
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,800
My friend said, wait, wait

449
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,800
He said, wait, wait and I woke up

450
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
He came closer

451
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,800
When he came closer, it was the second time

452
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
That was the second time

453
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
That was the second time

454
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,800
When I woke up, I laughed

455
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
It was the third time

456
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
It was the third time in a row

457
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
But I was surprised too

458
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,800
When I saw you, I thought you were walking on the sidewalk

459
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800
You're a small kid

460
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,800
You're so dark

461
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:06,800
You're walking on the sidewalk like this

462
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I don't walk on the sidewalk more than one time

463
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,800
At least more than two times

464
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,800
This is a question for Matsumoto-san

465
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I saw a lot

466
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,800
When bugs die, why do they look up?

467
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I can't say that, but I remember

468
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
When you go to a funeral

469
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
You say, look up

470
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I know

471
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
You don't stop?

472
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Why?

473
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
You're definitely scared

474
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm not scared

475
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
You know I'm going to a funeral

476
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
That's true, but

477
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
What should I say?

478
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
You don't have to say anything

479
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
But you say, look up, look up

480
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
You get tired of it

481
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
To be honest

482
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Really?

483
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,800
But it's not like it's a joke

484
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
The other day at Yoshie-shi

485
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
You said look up

486
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Tsurubayama-san came

487
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
He said, Hamada, come here

488
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I said, look at this face

489
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
That's the cause

490
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
It's fine

491
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
It's fine, but

492
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,800
You shouldn't look at a normal person

493
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
That's why

494
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
You shouldn't laugh

495
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
That's what Tsurubayama-san did

496
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,800
He said, look, it's a katakana

497
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,800
And he said, look up

498
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Right?

499
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
He's obviously blindfolded

500
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
That's true

501
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
You're scared of him

502
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
You don't know

503
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
So even if I die

504
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I don't know if my family will be there

505
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
My family might say, look up

506
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
But you shouldn't look

507
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Why?

508
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
It's a win-win

509
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Please

510
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
What do you mean please?

511
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Please

512
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
What do you mean please?

513
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,800
It's fine, everyone will laugh

514
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
That's fine, right?

515
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
That's fine

516
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
I said this before, but Shohei-san

517
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Even if I die, I want you to put on yellow glasses

518
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
If I say, look up, what kind of glasses are those?

519
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
That's fine

520
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm popular because

521
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
If I say, look up, look up

522
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I want to look like this

523
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I want to laugh like this

524
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
I understand

525
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I want to wear glasses like this
