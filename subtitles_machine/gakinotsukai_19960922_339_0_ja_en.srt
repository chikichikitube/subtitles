1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You're so cute.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're so popular.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're so funny.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, there are many things.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are many things.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Are there many things?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There aren't.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There was a letter in the mail the other day.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I wrote a lot of things.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To put it simply,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I asked him to lend me 3 million yen.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can lend it to me.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please lend me 3 million yen.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why didn't you write that you have it?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I made a card.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I made a card.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When I made a card,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I felt like I had all my money,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so I used it up.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's normal.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It has nothing to do with me.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I thought it had something to do with me.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I was a fan of Mr. Matsumoto.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When I used up all of his money,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I had a lot of debt.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's different.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's personal.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's personal.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want a bag.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want shoes.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want a month's rent of 3 million yen.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And then I want him to lend it to me.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When I use it,

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
people ask me to lend money a lot.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Really?

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why?

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Really?

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't even have money to borrow.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Everyone has cell phones.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I do, too.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why?

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm so angry!

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, I'm sorry.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's good that you can get in touch with her.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But there are times when I can't get in touch with her.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's really annoying.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I can call her, right?

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then...

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know if I keep calling her.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you know, you can call her again.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If I call her again, I'll call her again.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And then...

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I called her three times.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And when I called her again, she disappeared.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You've been fine until now, haven't you?

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why are you suddenly getting sick?

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm really angry.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But everyone's okay with that.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Harutatsu-kun has a cell phone in his bag, right?

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know if someone is pressing it inside, but it's ringing.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When I look at it, it's 8888.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is it?

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What kind of situation is this?

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, that's true.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But when I look at it, it's 88828.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you talking about?

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's been 8 all the time.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where did you go?

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sometimes I call her and it's ringing.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's 88828, and no one's answering.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm so angry.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's ringing, but it's not ringing.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't think it's time to sell cell phones yet.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not complete yet.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Even if you're talking to a car driver, sometimes the other person's voice suddenly sounds like a robot.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm scared.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your voice sounds like a robot, too.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm scared.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll tell you a little bit.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you press it, this part will light up, right?

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It'll light up, so you can use it in the car.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But the time it lights up is short.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you understand?

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, for example, if it's a PokéBell, you press it twice.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It disappears while you're doing it.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't understand.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wait until all the PokéBell are in.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What's wrong with you?

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It'll be gone in a second.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It disappears.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You'll fall asleep.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You'll fall asleep, and when you look at it, there are three of them.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you look at it like this, you'll fall asleep again.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm looking at him.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't even know where I'm looking at.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know. I'm looking at an apple.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's completely sick.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You were fine until now, weren't you?

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm hungry.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's something everyone can think of.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Please be careful.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What should I be careful about?

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, no, no.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The knitting.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What about the knitting?

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So please be careful when you wash it.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, don't you?

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I told you to put it in the net and wash it.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But don't say it.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I didn't expect you to be so careful.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you very much.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The audience is so energetic.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Everyone is.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The audience is so energetic.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's okay.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When you watch this kind of energetic audience on TV, your laughter sounds like a lie.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It sounds like you're stabbing someone.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It sounds like you're stabbing someone.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right?

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll take it off.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll take it off.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll take it off.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know anything about TV anymore.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't say it.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't say it.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's a lot of things I don't understand.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What the hell are you talking about?

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What country are you talking about?

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't know.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're supporting the Titans, aren't you?

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm supporting them.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do the Titans win?

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The Titans win.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, really?

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you going to give up?

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm in a bad place right now.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do something if you're going to win.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What?

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't give up.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You'll get punished.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not saying anything.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not going to give up.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is embarrassing.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is hard.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not going to give up no matter where I go.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not going to give up no matter where I go.

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Please, Hanako.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not going to give up no matter where I go.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:29,000
When something sad happens, you spread your wings wide and fly in the night sky while crying.

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why are you so sad?

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You almost got knocked down the other day.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you okay?

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, that's...

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Put your wings out before that.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a hand.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a hand.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can't fly with a hand.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A hand becomes a wing.

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I see.

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can only fly when something sad happens.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can't fly now.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think it happened four times in the past.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Death.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Someone died.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Something sad.

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's death.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's right.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Death is the saddest thing.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Right?

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who died first?

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When Pearl died.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That stupid dog.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's called Gakushakenya.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're lying.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not a dog.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's called Gakushakenya.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's completely Gakushakenya.

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who?

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That person.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When Pearl died?

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, when Pearl died.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How did you fly?

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How did I fly?

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you have a posture when you fly?

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, I do.

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can fly from the second floor window.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're old.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Old?

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can go down once.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's like Choro-kyu.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's right.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's the principle of Choro-kyu.

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I go down once and then go forward.

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you understand?

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you understand?

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What are you doing?

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going in.

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What are you doing?

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going in.

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What are you going in?

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going in.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There's a crack in the air.

219
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're going in there?

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Please show me.

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Please show me your posture.

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
My posture?

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going in.

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

229
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going in.

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going in.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes, yes, yes.

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going in.

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going in.

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
From here on, you're like the head of the picture.

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Stop it.

236
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's completely different.

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The shape is the head of the picture.

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Zen, I'm conscious of something.

239
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you taste the bottom of sadness, you can fly.

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The bottom of sadness, the bottom of sadness, the bottom of sadness.

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's all about the bottom of sadness.

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I want to go up because it's the bottom of sadness.

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Please tell me that, too.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to be shot down soon.

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is a lie.

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a lie.

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's all a lie.

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What is harder and harder than bungee jumping?

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In the end, there's a limit to what's scary.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's why I have no choice but to add to the fear.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hey.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You have a lot of guts.

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's scary.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hey.

256
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Where are you looking at?

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you going to stay still?

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey.

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is the scariest.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's all I have.

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Tiger, yakuza.

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I only have a cutter knife.

263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Cutter?

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, well, well.

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's why the yakuza rides on the tiger.

266
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm scared if the tiger has a cutter.

267
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The tiger is riding on it.

268
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The yakuza is not riding on it.

269
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The tiger has a cutter here.

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, I see.

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'd be scared if I had poison on me.

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're a kid.

273
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's my way of thinking.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What kind of gum should I throw away?

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The person who invented the word gum is a genius.

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is that so?

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Because there's no food like this.

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It doesn't go away permanently.

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It doesn't go away.

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't you put gum in your mouth?

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There are people who swallow gum.

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But if you swallow gum, it's bad for your body.

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's right.

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, I'll tell you the truth.

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're a troublemaker.

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't you tell me when you throw away gum?

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
When I chew gum for a long time, I throw up.

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's not funny.

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't think it's funny.

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No, no, no.

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm not talking about that.

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why?

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll throw up.

294
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why?

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's not good for your taste.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If you keep complaining about it, it'll be disgusting.

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's right.

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Some people say good things about it.

299
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's the same when you throw away the gum as it is when you throw away a woman.

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, say it.

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
When you throw away a woman...

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Love is all about excitement.

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
While you're excited, your love will always...

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
...grow into a hole.

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It will blossom.

306
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right?

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Love and...

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm asking about when you throw away the gum.

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is it still going on?

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's still going on.

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Excitement. You'll meet her today.

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wait till 10 o'clock.

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You'll meet her today.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's going to be a long time.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You'll get excited thinking about it.

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I hope so.

317
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
During this time, love is alive.

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's talk about the gum.

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The gum and the woman are the same.

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
When you throw away the gum, you won't get excited.

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What's that?

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sure you'll get excited when you throw away the gum.

323
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't care if you cry all of a sudden.

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like this.
