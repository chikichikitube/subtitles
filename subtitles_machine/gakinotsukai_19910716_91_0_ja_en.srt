1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we don't have an opening, right?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Really?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you want?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want to show you something.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Today I'm here to show you Hamada-kun's documentary.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Bring the monitor.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why are you so excited?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I came here to see you, Kin-chan.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Can I go home now?

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You should have told me earlier.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's take a picture.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hamada-chan.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can't you do it?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I know what I want to do.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You look tired.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want to do it.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, no.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I just want to run.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know how to do it.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ouch!

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Which one do you want?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I brought a lot of collections.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here you are, Hamada-chan.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Here you are.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You look good.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You look cool.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shall we go?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll be right back.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Really?

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll be right back.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This one.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It looks cool.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, it does.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're here.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Good morning.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Good morning.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you wearing a mask?

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You look funny.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I heard about you.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Really?

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shall we run?

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's run.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're funny.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're funny.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're funny.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're funny.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, no.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're welcome.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's rare to see a man wearing a costume.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're cool.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're good.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're really good.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, I am.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's do our best.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Can you show us?

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll do it.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's go.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:40,000
One, two, three, four.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're too much.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One more time.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What's wrong with you?

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's wrong with you?

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait a minute.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're moving too fast.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You go first.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why are you wearing it so many times?

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're slow.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're moving too fast, so I'll do it again.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm waiting for you.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's good.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go next week.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Go next week.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go next week.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll wait for you next week.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't say that.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, that's it.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm done.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm waiting for you next week.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're a talent, so I'm waiting for you next week.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't say that.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm a runner.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But I know you're watching today.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not a runner.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not trying to be nice, but I'm watching the monitor and I'm wondering if you're really a runner.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Really.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Really.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're really good.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I'm not a runner at all.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's enough.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, that's it.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're next week.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's okay to do this once.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I won't do it twice.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You were shooting a short story when we met in my dream.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I thought it was over early.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is my staff.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's go.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It was your dream.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Who is it?

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said it yourself.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're a dream chaser.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hama-chan.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't touch me.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The air I'm running in is going to air on Thursday next week.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Everyone, please watch it.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll lower the monitor.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey, you.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know what?

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What?

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm going to do special training before Marukome.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No, no, no, no.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Marukome doesn't exist in this world.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It does.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's not true.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The Marukome commercial is like a box with a kid in it.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're going to do that, too.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mom.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I won't throw it.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hello, mom.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No one is laughing.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mom.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's okay.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
No.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're going to do special training.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not going to do it.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I sent you my resume.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to do it tonight.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What are you looking at?

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going to do it.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No, no, no.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You look like an underworld beast.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm not going to do it.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm not going to do it.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're going to do it.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm going to do it.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going to pull it.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All the staff are going to do it.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not going to pull it.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, no, no.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm going to pull it lightly.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not plastic.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think it's three or five people.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The old men in the audition are sitting there.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The kid is like this.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're sitting in there, too.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There's a view next to the kid.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to do it like a mother.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Like a mother's child.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going to do it.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to do it.

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And I'm a mother.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're my mother.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to do it.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's do it before that.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Run properly.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going to do it with energy.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm a kid.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to do it.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It looks like fun.

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Understand?

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The hand is like this.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You should do it.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't do it.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't understand.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't do it.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why?

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's decided by the person.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know how I feel.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't understand at all.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
For 10 years, the two of us have been doing it with our eyes closed.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Even when we're having a hard time, we're doing it together.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's why.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm telling you.

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm telling you.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Think about when you're having a hard time and you can't eat.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you mean?

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What?

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know.

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't think I've had enough strength before.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's okay.

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's okay.

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What?

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's okay.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I was totally exhausted in Fukuoka yesterday.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It doesn't matter.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know what?

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I went to a regional office like Fukuoka.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was so tired.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I went there.

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I went there.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I went there.

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I went there.

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I went there.

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't mess with me!

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then, yesterday's Nijinon Broadcast in Fukuoka...

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not going there!

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't talk to me!

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't talk to me!

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't talk to me!

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Our new idol singer don't.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're so loud!

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We'll shut up!

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We were rehearsing when we got into the studio.

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We were setting up.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The all-Kyushu comedy contest!

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It stinks, doesn't it?

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's all right.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I was on this stage.

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was in rehearsal.

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then, the musician came out from here and explained to me.

240
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, I see.

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This guy.

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was listening to his explanation.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Around here.

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
After a long time, I asked the audience.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What the hell are you doing?

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I...

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was doing something.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're the one who has a bad attitude.

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The set is...

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's a countryside, so the set is...

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It smells like countryside.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a dirty set.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I looked at it and it was like this.

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're the one!

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's you too!

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's you!

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I was listening to his explanation.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's been broken for a long time, so it's strange.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What is it?

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What is it?

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you say it's a countryside, it's a dirty set.

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're the one who has a bad attitude.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's you!

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's true that you have a bad attitude.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What do you mean?

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Makeup is just putting on foundation.

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Normally, you put on a lot of makeup.

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But you can't do that.

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You put on a lot of foundation.

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Then, you put on a lot of foundation.

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Then, you put on a lot of foundation.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When I asked if you had a powder, you said,

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Huh?

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is it powder?

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't know.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's powder. Don't you know?

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What did you say? Is it a cod roe?

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're a bad actor.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why?

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why do you have such a bad attitude?

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What do you think?

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What do you mean?

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's true.

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I was on a plane.

286
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was on a plane.

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I was so angry.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The man next to you...

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The man next to me was sitting next to me.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was a two-seater.

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The man who was sitting next to me...

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was so angry.

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It was amazing.

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And I saw his nose was stuffed.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The nose was stuffed.

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was breathing heavily.

297
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And...

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
When I got here...

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What was that?

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I fell down like I was dancing like a god.

301
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
My nose didn't come.

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hey, it stinks! Come here!

303
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I did it 10 times, and in the 11th time I got wet with tears.

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This really stinks!

305
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was a demon hunter, and I was told that I can grant 3 wishes.

306
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
First, I want money.

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And the next, I want to get rid of all the stinky people in the world.

308
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And the third, I want to get a new partner.

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The second wish is to get rid of you.

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Shut up!

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's so hot.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
First, I want to bring a fan.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You scared me!

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What's going on?

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you very much.

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's Moriko Watanabe.

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Did you write this yourself?

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, I did.

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What's wrong?

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What?

321
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Did you want to be on the show?

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, I did.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In this rotten show?

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's the most memorable one.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The one when I broke a tree.

327
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The one with the bad character?

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes.

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It was like an occult movie, wasn't it?

330
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The ogre comes and wakes you up, right?

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's right.

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He says, where were you yesterday?

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And when he takes a picture of you, a bear comes out of your eyes and says,

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't care where you are.

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you very much.

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Can I avoid you?

337
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What?

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's over.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Already?

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes.

341
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Can I take this?

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No, no.

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If you take this, it's over.

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Aren't you going to read it?

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I will read it.

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What about me?

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't need it.

348
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't need it.

350
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I said I don't need it.

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I've had a few entertainers come up to me.

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But this is the first time I've seen you so nervous.

353
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No matter what.

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I understand.

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
See you next week.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Thank you very much.

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
She's funny.

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
She's a funny person.

360
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm a big fan of Machan and Hama.

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Please make me your teacher.

362
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Why?

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Why?

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I've been doing this for 10 years.

365
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't be his student.

366
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It was funny.

368
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It was funny.

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What are you talking about?

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When I first saw this, I thought it was a postcard.

371
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
At first, I didn't know what it was.

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I looked at it and said,

373
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Please make me your teacher.

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What?

375
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't lie to me.

376
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Whose student are you now?

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Now?

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
When I joined, I was asked if I was going to join the Shunryu or Hanshin Kyojin.

379
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You were asked.

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Now?

381
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm here now.

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You should be at the bottom.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why?

384
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I dare to.

385
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Who is good?

386
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There's a lot of things.

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you talking about?

388
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Who are you?

389
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't stare at me.

390
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What are you doing?

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, no, no.

392
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That story hasn't disappeared.

393
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's over quietly.

394
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What are you talking about?

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It was funny.

396
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm still the same.

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't be afraid of what people say.

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't think so.

399
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What are you talking about?

400
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't break the joke.

401
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's not a joke.

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If it was a joke, I would have said it.

403
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's enough.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What is this?

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What you're doing is different.

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's enough.

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Good evening.

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I heard on the radio that you started to go to a car lesson.

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What do you think about beating me?

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I haven't gone yet.

413
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But I want to go.

414
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You already have a driver's license.

415
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I got a driver's license.

416
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You got a driver's license.

417
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How many years have you been a drunk?

418
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's a long time.

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, no, no.

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But that's about two years.

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
About two years?

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If you haven't been on for two years, you should have.

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes.

424
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I haven't been on for two years.

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then try it.

426
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What?

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Try it.

428
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What?

429
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You get in the car.

430
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah.

431
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Open the door.

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I should open the door.

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You should open the door.

434
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You should open the door.

435
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I should open the door.

436
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll open it.

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Gacha!

438
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Close the room!

439
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You can't close it!

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Good shot!

441
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Close it first!

442
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I've received a lot of projects to commemorate the 100th anniversary.

443
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Ah, that's right, it's the 100th.

444
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I've received about 10,000 of them.

445
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I've received the letters from Numazu City in Shizuoka Prefecture.

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Last time I was in Okinawa, so this time I'm going to Hokkaido.

447
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm going to visit my father, Shibori.

448
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm going to take my father back to Tokyo and save the children of the Karishimo family.

449
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What are you talking about?

450
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This is not a good thing at all.

451
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's not a good thing at all, but Hokkaido is good.

452
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
In terms of location?

453
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

454
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Where do you want to go?

455
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll take you anywhere.

456
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Where do you want to go?

457
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Anywhere?

458
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I want to go to Okinawa or a cool place.

459
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't have a vacation this summer.

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's go to Hawaii or somewhere.

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Why do you want to go?

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't want anyone to go anywhere.

463
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't want to go anywhere like that.

464
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't get it.

465
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I want to go around the globe and snap my fingers.

466
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't want to go.

467
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What are you going to do if you end up in Africa or something like that?

468
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Don't you want to go?

469
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
More than that, if you go around the globe like this, you'll probably end up in the ocean.

470
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's not impossible.

471
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't want to go to a strange place.

472
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No, it's fun.

473
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's up to you.

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's why I'm telling you to go somewhere!

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't want to go.

476
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Never.

477
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You don't want to go?

478
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't want to go.

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It can't be helped.

480
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey!

481
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You're so honest!

482
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't want to go.

483
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is that so?

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's kind of easy, isn't it?

485
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, we're looking for people like that.

486
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

487
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But it's only 100 times.

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's too early.

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, everyone, have fun again.

490
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Goodbye!

491
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're just an idiot!

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hello!

493
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hello, hello.

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

495
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We talked about what we should do for the 100th anniversary.

496
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's recruit them.

497
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's right.

498
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What should we do?

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Where should we go?

500
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's up to you whether to involve them or just us.

501
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, that's true.

502
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So please let us do it in various ways.

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We'll recruit them.

504
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If you have any questions, please send them to us.

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And how to get home.

506
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We'll go home in a van.

507
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We'll smoke and go home.

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We're also looking for ways to get home.

509
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's all.

510
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And the assistant.

511
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We're always the same.

512
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's all we know.

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So we can't do anything about it.

514
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Goodbye!

515
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Send them to us.

516
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Goodbye!

517
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Say goodbye to the camera at the end.

518
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Goodbye!

519
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What are you doing?

520
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No, no.

521
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Look forward.

522
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I saw it.

523
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Look at it carefully.

524
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Look at it.

525
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't look away!

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't look away!
