1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yohan's wife

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yohan's wife

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yohan's wife is a good friend

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Always together

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
always together

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yohan's wife

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yohan's wife

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yohan's wife

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm your wife

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Wait, wait

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Who told you to do this?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't know

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't care

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But you're a charismatic person

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're a charismatic entertainer

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's not true

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're wearing a charismatic collar

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm a charismatic entertainer

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're wearing a charismatic short sleeve

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's popular now

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't know

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You wear anything charismatic

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What do you mean by charismatic?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I do it myself

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm a charismatic entertainer

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's what you mean

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I do it behind my back

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's just the sound of it

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I do it in the bathroom for 10 minutes

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I hope you're doing well today

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's been a year since I became a monk

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There were three people who asked me to shake their hands

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Even in Tokyo

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can I touch your head?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What are you doing?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You should have been nicer to your fans

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You shouldn't have done that

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's rude

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're just walking

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What if you get hit in the back?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't you think that's annoying?

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's really annoying

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please understand that part

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What if you get hit in the back with a towel?

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you get hit in the back with a towel, I'll laugh

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Is that so?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You have to be more clear about common sense and non-common sense

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What if a 17-year-old girl comes to you and asks you to touch her head?

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You'll be hit by a horse

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A horse?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You'll be hit by a horse

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's not good

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can I touch your head if I don't do it?

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't like being touched

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You shouldn't do that

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can't you do it like this?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You have to stretch your body

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You have to stretch your body

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you do that

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What if I put a bandage on my head?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll do it like this

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you can't do it like this, I'll give up

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll do it like this

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Aren't you Mickey Mouse?

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Think about it

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're 36

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Isn't Mickey Mouse a cowboy?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's not like I'm wearing it

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't wear it

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't want to wear it

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you want to try it on?

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What are you doing?

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't want to wear it

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wait a minute

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to wear it

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't want to wear it

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't want to wear it

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't want to wear it

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't want to wear it

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're annoying

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't want to wear it

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't want to wear it

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't believe you're so happy

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Take it out

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're the one who turned on the TV

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're the one who turned on the TV

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm going to ask a question to Mr. Matsumoto

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There's a famous fairy tale about the sea getting salty

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is there a fairy tale that people should be able to understand?

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know if there is

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There is

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's a fairy tale about a old man in Gunma

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Really?

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You don't know it?

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've seen most of the old fairy tales

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Tell me

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There was an old man

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There was an old woman

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There was an old man

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There was an old man

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The old man couldn't move so the old woman was taking care of the field

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The field came out

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The field came out

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
After that, the old man went to the side

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It has nothing to do with the old man

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The old man came out

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't think that's the story

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't remember the story

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was just looking

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't remember

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's not the story

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a nice story, Mr. Matsumoto

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I always want people to think I'm intelligent

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Of course

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It doesn't work

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Mr. Matsumoto

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you say this line, people will definitely think you're intelligent

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Please tell me how

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Of course

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There's no man who doesn't like people who aren't intelligent

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can tell him

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can tell him

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Of course I have to tell him

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you say that, you don't have intelligence

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I still have a bit of a bone

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What?

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Was I wrong?

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Whose question are you talking about?

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is a very simple story

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I want you to come to my house at least once a week

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I want you to take a lesson

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
1 hour and 20 minutes

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why are you talking like that?

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
1 hour is fine

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was doing it for an hour and a half

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's like tea time

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
1 hour and 20 minutes

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No, but it's easy

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I want to teach you

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I want to teach the audience

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want to teach the people watching TV

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But I don't want to teach you

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I won't allow you to absorb it

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What should I do?

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's teach

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's talk

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is this?

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's not

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a very simple story

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What do you always put English in the conversation?

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you understand?

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you are asked something

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you don't put at least one English word

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I feel like I can't give it back to the other person

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you understand?

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you think it's intelligence to give it back?

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Of course

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's hot today

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It was a degression

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a dark side

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's going to rain tomorrow, but it's going to be sunny

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a stretch

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a little early

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Calm down

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I almost cried

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You should talk more

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You should talk for about one minute

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And ask me

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Otherwise it's impossible

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you understand?

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Tatsuyoshi's game was in Osaka

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He went alone

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He went to Osaka Dome by himself

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It was the last game

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He went home

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He went to Osaka by taxi

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He came back to Tokyo by Shinkansen

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It was a hard day

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't do anything
