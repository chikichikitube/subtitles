1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On the 3rd episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikichiki, Nakibokuro, Okamoto, Kojine Tokai Saksen!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is the 3rd episode of our show. I think this is the first time.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I always get thrown out at the first episode.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I always get thrown out at the first episode.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's take a look at the goods.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ta-da!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is the goods for today.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's finished nicely.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today, we're going to look at the bigger ones.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How much have you changed today?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This jumper was quite expensive.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It was about 20,000 yen.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In total, it was about 25,000 yen.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where are the other 5,000 yen?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We've prepared a lot of things for you.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You look cool.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wow, look at his belly!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Look at his chest!

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What a dirty body!

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Look at his underwear!

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's wearing nice underwear.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Gyo-san, you smell like Trunks.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Look at his eyes!

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Nice!

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is nice.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You look cool.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As a member of the society, I borrowed this from Yasu-san.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's look at this one.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He looks cool.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He looks like an artificial human.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Good, good.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Take your time.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You look cool!

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wow!

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to go to the bathhouse.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How about this one?

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It looks like Kyoko Kishida.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a bit funky.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can you say, good morning?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wow, you look cool.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You look twice as good as I thought.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You look like a stylist.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What is this?

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You look like Machiko Machi.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You have a hand like this.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can't see your face.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Wow, you look cool!

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is nice.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Can you play something on the guitar?

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you want me to do?

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can you play Alice?

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You look like Inazuma.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Good morning.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good morning.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know if our sense of coordination is good or not.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We have a judge.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's see if this is good.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's all we can do.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But Okamoto-kun did it too.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He did it too.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The manager is Okamoto-kun's mother.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hey, you should behave yourself.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a funky school.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You didn't go to college to do this, did you?

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to thank my mother for raising me.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll do my best in this school.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You didn't go to college to do this.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Everyone is quite an adult.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Although I'm an idiot.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is the most difficult age.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What are you talking about?

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm serious.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm serious.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How old are these people?

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
22 or 23.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is the most difficult age.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You were laughing a lot.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is the most difficult age.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is the most difficult age.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
With a light touch.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're laughing.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If I were a high school student, I would laugh like this.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, no, no.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's enough to laugh like this.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm just saying.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a difficult time.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a difficult time.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Everyone is shining.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You don't have to worry about yourself.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everyone has worries.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have a lot of worries.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't have any worries.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't have any worries.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are your worries?

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm worried about my family.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your family?

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I got it.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your family smells bad.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a smelly house.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's not the smell of the house.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's the smell of the house.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not that smelly.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's smelly.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You have a smelly house.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You have a smelly house.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I said it's a smelly house.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a smelly house.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a smelly house.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I also put on my school uniform.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You don't have to worry about your school uniform.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a smelly house.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Everyone is wearing a school uniform.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When my parents and my father became blind,

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the smell came out.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Electricity, bang!

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's the smell that was generated by the chopsticks.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is my own smell the same as my family's smell?

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
However, because there were four families,

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the energy is amazing.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The house is excited.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I was wondering what it was.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You, really.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's rude.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But everyone thinks so.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So if you get married and have a family,

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you can create a new smell.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Furthermore,

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know if it will be even more powerful.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And the strange thing is that the taste of water is also different.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Depending on the house?

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Depending on the house.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't care about the water in my house even if it's tap water.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can't drink it well.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I can't drink it well.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The water in that house is different.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I understand.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Also, the rice balls held by the mother of the person

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
are very strange.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Uncertain about appetite.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I understand that, but

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the mother of the person over there also holds it beautifully.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not bad or smelly.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't like it.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't care about the mother of my child.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't care about the mother of my child at all.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's not a woman.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't like the mother of my child.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why?

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's good that someone studied it properly.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why do people eat the same thing and live the same life?

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why is the smell different depending on the house?

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know.

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a mystery.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So look,

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There are people who get married to their friends' sister or younger sister.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know about that.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Your sister smells like you, so I can't do anything about it.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What do you call this smell?

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a very unique smell.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why is it unique?

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
To put it simply, it's the smell of your house.

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Why?

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is that so?

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't know.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your house smells like dried grass.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know about that.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why does it smell like dried grass?

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Didn't you worry about such a thing in the past?

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
About such a thing?

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why am I such a little bastard?

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't worry about such a thing.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Everyone worries about it.

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't worry about it.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm big.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you worry about such a thing?

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There was a time when I was worried about it.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought I would be smaller than others.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Now that I think about it, I don't worry about such a thing at all.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There are times when I was worried about it.

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is that so?

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, there are.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think there are a lot of girls.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What kind of girls?

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Girls worry about their nipples.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's like a girl.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What's wrong with your nipples?

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you have a nipple?

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Some girls have a pretty long nipple.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Some girls have a long nipple.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They have a long nipple.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Their nipples look like indica.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And there is a tip of the nipple.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It looks like a coffee bean.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He said, bring me some coins, I'm about to get bored of this.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's so desperate.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, I'm worried about that too.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Everyone's like, eat this!

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sure you've thought about this before, in the midst of this conversation.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, it's the other half of today's guest.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The show we did the other day was totally different, but

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
People often tell me that the guy from Kiko is a liar.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Kiko is a liar, right?

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's true.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He's not going to do something like that with our characters, is he?

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right, I have a character called Mr. Maric.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
When I was called by him, I definitely thought I was going to break up with him on a live broadcast.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I hate him so much.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't think he's going to fall.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I hate him so much that I can't move.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I hate him so much that I can't move.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He does this.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He has a lot of energy here.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have a lot of energy too.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But when I was called by him, I had this much energy from training.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Just by doing this, I have a lot of energy here.

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then...

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm not fooling around.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm not fooling around.

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No, no, no.

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's strange.

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He said, do you feel it?

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know.

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I felt like there was some air coming in.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I feel it too.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What?

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
At that time?

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No, no, even now.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know it's there.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't say that.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hey!

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's true.

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Do it.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have this much energy here.

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do it.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's not like that.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He was waiting like this.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I pushed him like this.

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And he was returning it like this.

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's do it again.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is wood.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wow, it's strong!

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's strong, isn't it?

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm going to write a letter to His Majesty.

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to write a letter to His Majesty.

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is wood.

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's strong.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's strong.

260
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well...

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What is it?

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's not enough.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You guys are a little crazy these days.

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My power is getting worse than before.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I used to be a little more affectionate.

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I used to be a little more affectionate.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I used to be a little more affectionate.

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't like your stupidity now.

269
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't like your stupidity now.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm going to punch you.

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't like your stupidity now.

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why do you have a good ratings?

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can't feel the phenomenon of comedy at all.

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If it goes on like this, Japanese TV will be made fun of by foreigners.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Please do something about it.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You can do whatever you want.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't know about the drama the other day, but...

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The drama the other day...

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The live-action version, right?

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The ratings were pretty good.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Knowing that, I'm going to do it on TV.

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm not confident anymore.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why?

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The day I got that kind of ratings...

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're definitely more interesting than a man.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What?

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Is that so?

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is that so?

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Sakai-san.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sakai-san from the drama the other day.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He said he saw it.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's there.

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's there.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's there.

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Get out of here.

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's about a third of it.

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's there.

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's right.

299
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's not right.

300
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He said he saw it.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, this is...

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But he didn't see the previous one.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What did he see, Sakai-san?

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Boom!

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Did you just hear that?

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's not like he saw the previous one.

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's like he wanted to see someone who was in it.

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Right?

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Who did he want to see?

310
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sakuma-san.

311
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Sakuma-san?

312
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He's always like that.

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's right.

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sakuma-san.

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He's always like that.

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He's the one who came out the earliest.

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Watsuko Asano was with Sazae-san.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Right?

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And Takuma...

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What was Takuma again?

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Shin?

322
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Takuma-san and Shin?

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Who was it?

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Masuo-san.

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, this Masuo-san.

326
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right?

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why?

328
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why?

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Eh?

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ikariya?

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Ikaria-san?

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ikaria-san isn't said much.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Ikaria-san is pretty good.

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He's a nice guy.

335
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What about you?

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yoshiyuki Kazuko-san?

337
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Ah, yes.

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Ah, Yoshiyuki Kazuko-san.

339
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That person too.

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Well, well, well.

341
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I like her.

342
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't have anyone else.

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Eh?

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What about you, Seiroji? Norisuke-san?

345
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ah, Norisuke-san.

346
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What about you, Taigo-san?

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Eh?

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Kokusho?

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What's Kokusho?

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Ah, the big guy with the big face!

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Ah!

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Ah, yes.

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is different.

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's different, right?

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's different, it's different.

356
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Takuma Shin is, well, around here,

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
in terms of artistic history,

358
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
even if you think about it after coming out,

359
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
you still have to do Tara-chan.

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's still too early for Matsuho-san.

361
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's too early.

362
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Eh, who is it? Takuma?

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Takuma, what?

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Shin?

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Shin?

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No, no!

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's not it!

368
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No, no!

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No!

370
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No!

371
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No!

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No!

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No!

374
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In the other day,

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
in the video,

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
there was an amazing film,

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
titled The Young Master of History,

378
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The Young Master of Alps.

379
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Even now,

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I continue to make this series.

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The Young Master of Wood is

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It is said that it is a ULUWA video, but what kind of story is it?

383
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I do not know.

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Even if it is said that it is the young minister of the Ereki series, I do not know what to do.

385
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Who is it? Who does not know what to do?

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The young minister of Ereki came from over there.

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I do not know what to do.

388
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, I do not see it.

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you. Thank you. The young minister of Ereki.

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And?

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's cold.

392
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What are you talking about?

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But I want to make a movie someday.

394
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What kind of movie do you want to make?

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I want to make a Godzilla movie.

396
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah.

397
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm tired of Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Yonezuke.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I do not see it.

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why?

400
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I do not see it.

401
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Why?

402
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Godzilla.

403
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Who is watching Yonezuke?

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Godzilla and Yonezuke are not fighting.

405
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I do not see it.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I often see it.

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why do you think the girl who has a tan looks like she will do it soon?

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I see.

409
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I do not see it.

410
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Do you think she will do it soon?

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I do not see it.

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
She is a little bit of a cheater.

413
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Listen to me.

414
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Hanage is in Japan.

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I have been watching Hanage all the time.

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There was a check before the show.

418
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Matsumoto said that Hanage is in Japan.

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But I could not do anything.

420
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I could not do anything.

421
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I have been watching it.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I did not see it.

423
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I did not see it.

424
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I did not see it.

425
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I did not see it.

426
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I did not see it.

427
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I do not see it.

428
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If you are in the video, you should be in the video.

429
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is not Hanage.

430
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This is Hanage.

431
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is...

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It is really like this.

433
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I do not care about this.

434
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I do not care about this.

435
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There is no one who has a tan today.

436
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But I think it is better not to have a tan as a girl.

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I do not think it is good.

438
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you think it is cool?

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think so.

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There are more men with long hair.

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

442
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That is from Yosuke Eguchi.

443
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Is that so?

444
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He was doing radio in Higashino, Imada.

445
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yosuke Eguchi was doing radio before them.

446
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He came to Higashino, Imada from Yosuke Eguchi.

447
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The radio was connected to Higashino, Imada after a little cross-talk.

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yosuke Eguchi said, I do not know Higashino, Imada.

449
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What are you doing?

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What are you doing?

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You should have said that.

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I think Yosuke Eguchi is strong.

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He looks strong, but he should not have said that.

454
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You should have said that.

455
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You should not have said that.

456
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That is...

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That is not good.

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You should not have said that because you do not know.

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You used to have a bad face.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I used to have a bad face too.

461
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But...

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You should not have said that.

463
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You should not have said that.

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I do not care.

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They often wear hats.

466
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What is that round thing on the top of the hat?

467
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That is...

468
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It is called a round thing.

469
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That is a hat.

470
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That is a hat.
