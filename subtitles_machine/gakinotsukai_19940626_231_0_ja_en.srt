00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He thought of 50 times.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He thought of 100 times, but he cut it down to 50.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's going to be so much fun.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's going to be so much fun.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's call him the gag angel who came down to the stage.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's cool.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000

Gag.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Today, we are going to do a surgery.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Surgery?

OK-kan.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000

Kiritsuki.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey, turn around.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My sister.

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you want to do the bed?

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000

What are you doing?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yay yay yay.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:18,000
27.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Aki-no-ta no kariko no ikono.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
OK.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OK.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OK.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
OK.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
After.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What?

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
When I talk while I'm in the sea turtle.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It hurts.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It hurts over there.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It hurts over there.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
43.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Anxiety of the eyes.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's coming out.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
44.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Missile launch.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Missile launch.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000

Flower rock.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
47.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Cinderella's one word.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Bon bon bon.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have to buy it quickly.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have to buy it.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have to buy it.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Tomorrow is sunny.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
48.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If the match is Ojiro.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I hate it.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
49.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you support Ojiro?

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What?

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I hate it.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
50.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Super Saiyan.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It was a wonderful performance.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How was it?

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It was good.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Was it good?

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It was good.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What was your most confident performance today?

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Naki-ken.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Naki-ken?

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What was it?

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Naki-ken?

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I got it.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's funny to see it from this distance.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Really.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
When I see it from there.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't touch it.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There is a gag that I can't do on TV.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I wanted to do it.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's called fure.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I want you to ask what it is.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is it?

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What should I do?

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When I saw the opening today, I thought, this is what an entertainer is like.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
When I saw him.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When I saw him.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's not good.

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Can I be an entertainer too?

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There are many people like that these days.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can I be an entertainer too?

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why?

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's why there are many people like that.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Right?

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm annoyed.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Recently, I've been told that I'm cheeky.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why?

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's you.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's you.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What is it?

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is it?

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Do it first.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's your fault.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think you have a bad attitude.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think you have a bad attitude.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't say it to anyone.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There are young entertainers.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm normal.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There are young entertainers like that.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Good morning.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Good morning.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When I look at it from the front, it looks great.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But that's too much.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's no one like this.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There's no one like this.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They keep appearing.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't say good morning.

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't say it.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I can't say it.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why?

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When I see a young entertainer, I say good morning.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's annoying.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Don't do that.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why do you keep appearing?

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Young people.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's why I'm getting more and more arrogant.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right?

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't want you to create such a situation.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's the same as the monsters in Ultraman.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
When they appear, everyone screams.

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't want to do anything.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They just came out.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's the same as that.

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're the one who saw it.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It has nothing to do with me.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But downtown has become a big deal.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's what the people are saying.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's what the people are saying.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I've never seen anything like that.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Young people say good morning.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That may not be the case.

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But you have a bad attitude when you come into the studio.

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sure you'll be told that.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What kind of attitude did I have when I was in the studio?

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's a big deal.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You have a long toothpick.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why?

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Give it to me.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Give me a long toothpick.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll use it when I'm in the studio tomorrow.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You're the new leader of young people's fashion.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're wearing long sleeves and short sleeves today.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want you.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It has nothing to do with me.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know you've always been a good brother to young people.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But you have a bad attitude when you come into the studio.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't have a bad attitude.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't know if you have that kind of atmosphere.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
When I go to the disco, I sit like this.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a low chair.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So I don't sit like this.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But you don't need a hand.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you look at me like that, I'm wearing a long sleeve.

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know what's good or bad.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're always in a bad mood at the end.

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm doing what you said earlier.

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't remember telling you to say hello properly.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then...

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wait a minute.

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm going to get hit.

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
For example, let's say there's a Tamori.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I'm Tamori.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It hurts, Tamori.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you do that, Tamori will hit you.

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's right.

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't do anything.

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't say that kind of thing.

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If I say something, he'll get angry.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He'll just say, good morning.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm not saying anything.

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I've seen a lot of things.

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think it's better to do this.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Who?

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Who are you talking about?

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't you understand?

246
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't lie to me.

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm scared.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm serious.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you're doing that, it's okay.

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't care if you tell me.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can tell you anything.

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You wrote something earlier.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If you refuse to kiss Tamori, he'll get angry.

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
How about you?

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm number one.

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Do you understand that?

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, kind of.

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why?

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He'll say, take off your underwear.

260
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you refuse to kiss him, he might get angry.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He might get angry, but the meaning is different.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The reason is different.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The reading is different.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Of course.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you crying?

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm scared.

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm a mother.

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm scared.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I haven't heard that reason.

270
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's not because your pride is hurt.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't want to kiss you as much as you refuse.

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So let me kiss you.

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It hurts.

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Adults hit me.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm serious.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you talking about?

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What are you talking about?

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's you.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What's the reason?

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't know.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm angry because you brought me here.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're angry, too.

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't understand why I want to see you.

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm angry because you brought me here.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wow.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's not because you're angry.

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can do it.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I understand.

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's the feeling of youth.

291
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You don't let me kiss you.

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What is this?

293
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't throw it away.

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It hurts.

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What are you going to do?

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You sit here.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I know what you're going to do.

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You don't cut it out.

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I see.

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're watching TV.

302
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I see.

303
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What are you going to do?

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Nothing will start with this.

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're watching TV.

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're doing this.

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Nothing will start with this.

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You don't like women.

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't like women.

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you want something to drink?

311
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes.

312
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What?

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'd like some oolong tea.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oolong tea?

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Calbee soda?

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'd like some oolong tea.

319
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'd like some oolong tea.

320
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'll go.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll go.

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll go.

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll go.

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll go.

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll go.

326
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll go.

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll go.

328
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You all mean that you didn't need to remember or listen to something.

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
May I ask?

330
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes?

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You were invited.

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You didn't attend, and you didn't even return it.

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you really have nothing to do with TV?

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No, we don't have anything to do with it.

335
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, we don't have anything to do with it.

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You have nothing to do with it.

337
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I see.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I see.

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And?

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And?

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You don't have anything to do with it.

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You have nothing to do with it.

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes, I wish you'll enjoy yourself

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
on TV.

345
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I understand. I'm close to that.

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I used to live in one room.

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can go with the flow.

348
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes, yes.

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Where to battle, that's the only way.

350
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Right? But recently, my bedroom is different.

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I see.

352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's like this.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But I can't do it here.

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I have to go there.

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I have to hold hands.

356
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This feeling is...

357
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's not good.

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's not good.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This is the worst time.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know what kind of face each of us makes.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know what kind of face each of us makes.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What is the feeling of being carried away?

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's right.

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm laughing a little.

365
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Are you laughing?

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm laughing a little.

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm laughing a little, but my legs are strange.

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You don't like that, do you?

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I understand that.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's embarrassing.

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Tokiya is the most embarrassing.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When I have to go to the bathroom.

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's because the movement is slow.

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you suddenly take me to the bedroom, I can't go anywhere.

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's true.

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you suddenly take me to the bedroom, I can't go anywhere.

377
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's because I try to do it with my back.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I hold my knees.

379
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The woman is like this.

380
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I've been doing it so far, but I'm still going to the bathroom.

381
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Why do you stretch your nose hair?

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't stretch my nose hair.

383
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How far do you stretch your nose hair?

384
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What are you trying to do?

385
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll tell you.

386
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I couldn't tell you today, but I'm going out again today.

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You're going out today, aren't you?

388
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And you're going out tomorrow, aren't you?

389
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm going out.

390
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Why?

391
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to see something unknown.

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I know. I'm going to stretch my nose hair.

393
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's almost the 21st century.

394
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's a big event for the earth.

395
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If you think about it, I can't stretch my nose hair.

396
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's right.

397
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's right.

398
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think the human body is made precisely, but it's stupid.

399
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I just need to stretch my nose hair.

400
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm a fool.

401
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can stretch my nose hair as many times as I want.

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
People look down on me.

403
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There are some places where you can only stretch your nose hair.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can't stretch my nose hair all the time.

406
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's because you know your position.

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Listen to me.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Who are you talking to?

409
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm talking to other people.

410
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm the president of the company.

411
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's a big deal.

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Come here.

413
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm angry.

414
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If the president of the company is so angry, it's a big deal.

415
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If we stretch our nose hair, it won't be fashionable.

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If we stretch our nose hair more than the president of the company, it won't be fashionable.

417
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm the president of the company.

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you feel the same way?

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Give me some tea.

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What about me?

423
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I didn't know that.

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hello.

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I've been wondering about this for a long time.

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You always turn around when you appear on any program.

427
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Why is that?

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
When you come out, do you come out like this?

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know.

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But I come out a few times.

431
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Why do I come out like this?

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You have a reason and a meaning.

433
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If I have a reason and a meaning, I'll know why I come out like this.

434
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You have a reason and a meaning.

435
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You have a reason and a meaning.

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You have a reason and a meaning.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know.

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know.

439
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It hurts.

440
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
