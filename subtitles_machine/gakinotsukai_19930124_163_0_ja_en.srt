1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today, we're going to do another prank.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today's prank is...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think this is the first time we've done something like this.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Please explain.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today, Team Zero's...

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He's going to do it.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
From now on, our program...

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He's the director of the Japanese TV.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's going to bring two people a month and three people in total.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He's a great person.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think he's doing a great job.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I think he's going to do a great job.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then...

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He found a guy named the director of the Japanese TV.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He said,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
By the way, have you ever killed someone with a stick or something?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm a little interested in it.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can you do it for me?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He said,

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to do it while saying that.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Actually, the director of the Japanese TV.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's Zero.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He's the devil of the director.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And when he sees that, he's going to do it again.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's going to happen?

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is going to be fun.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's going to fly twice.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's going to fly twice.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The director of the Japanese TV.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Today, we're going to do the director of the Japanese TV.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First of all, I'd like to thank the director of the Japanese TV.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Basically, I'd like to thank the director of the Japanese TV.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I'd like to bring the product to the director of the Japanese TV.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's just changed last year.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a copy of Morobare.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're laughing.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Basically, this is not a company.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a company called KINK.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I really ask you.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's easy to ride.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I really ask you.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm afraid I'll have to skip the show.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But if you bring it to me, I'll be right back.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Good job.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll pay you.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Okada is too good.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's good.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a copy of Morobare.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll pay you.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll pay you.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll pay you.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Downtown.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You have been actively cooperating with our regular program downtown.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I would like to thank you for your sincere effort and consideration.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mr. Ishikawa is the director of the company.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Okada is the director of the company.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mr. Downtown.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm glad to see you.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm glad to see you.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm glad to see you.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are crazy.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm a member of the team.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm an actor.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can watch it at the opening of our show.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
At the opening?

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, I don't watch other shows.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have a regular show?

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, I don't watch other shows.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a live show of Dantan from TBS.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TBS?

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I watched it!

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It was fun.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, this?

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I skipped it.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What should I do?

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You skipped it?

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No, I can't do it.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can't do it?

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, I can't do it.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, I can't do it.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The teacher is right behind you.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Teacher?

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a lesson.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A lesson?

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's for two days.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What?

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's for two days.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you want me to do it?

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, no.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Then someone else will do it.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, no.

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, no, no.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, no, no.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, no, no.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no, no.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No, no, no.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, no, no.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No, no, no.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, no, no.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, no, no.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, no, no.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is a sad journey.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, I can't do it.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, no.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The teacher is there too.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, no.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If the teacher is there, you can do it.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can do it.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I want to practice for about an hour before the actual performance.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I want to practice.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Go ahead.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go ahead.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No, no, no.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, no, no.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, no.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't do it during the actual performance.

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, no.

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll do it.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't do it.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll try to hit you.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Idiot!

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Idiot!

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Idiot!

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Idiot!

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Come here.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I didn't do anything.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You didn't do anything.

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll hit you harder.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you okay?

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll hit you harder.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Idiot!

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Idiot!

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Idiot!

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Idiot!

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Idiot!

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Idiot!

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Idiot!

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Idiot!

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm glad.

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I thought it was bad, but it was fun.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It was easy.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm flying around here.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Really?

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's no such thing.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's no such thing.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's funny.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hello.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How are you doing?

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry I'm dressed like this.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're good.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What do you think?

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
People are happy about other people's misfortunes.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you mean?

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've been doing this show for years.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think the punishment game is the best.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want to see how ugly you are.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I like to see people suffering.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You do it at the end of the year.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
When the camera sees you, it's like you're drowning.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or when you're saved by a helicopter.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's really fun.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's really fun.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My mother loves animals.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When a deer is chased by a leopard,

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I tell it to run away.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I tell it to run away.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But it doesn't have a smile on its face.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
When a deer runs away, it screams.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When a deer runs away, I tell it to run away.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You don't have to tell it to run away.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It doesn't have a smile on its face.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I tell it to run away.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
When a deer is caught, it screams.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I tell it to run away.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I tell it to look at me.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My father is next to me.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We are looking at each other.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm happy.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's easy to increase the ratings of the TV.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's a condition.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If I suddenly do something funny here,

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll be in trouble.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If I suddenly do something funny, I'll be in trouble.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll be in trouble.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
52%

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
A lot.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A lot.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Really.

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Food.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then...

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Food, animals, children.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I take care of these things.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's enough.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's why I always see a guy like Mutsugoro.

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He can do special effects.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He doesn't do anything.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He just takes care of himself.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He is the king of Mutsugoro.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He is the king of Mutsugoro.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Food and animals win.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The best thing is that Mutsugoro can't be eaten by animals.

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Really.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll see.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
85%

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mutsugoro will be eaten.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Really.

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's the most fun.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Unfortunately, I'm very angry.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Who are you?

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The other day...

239
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't think you should hit a normal citizen.

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why?

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are times when you really want to hit him.

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's right.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That guy...

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Shut up!

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm next to you.

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't touch me.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What?

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't touch me.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What?

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What do you want?

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Who are you?

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Who are you?

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't care at all.

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hurry up and call me.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hurry up and call me.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Where are you going?

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Where are you going?

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't hide anymore.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm coming.

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm coming.

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Come out.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm really angry.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was really angry on the Shinkansen the other day.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I didn't sleep.

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I slept on the Shinkansen for three hours and arrived in Osaka.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I had no choice but to sleep on the Shinkansen.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
When I sat down, there was a pig next to me.

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When I arrived, I started to sneeze.

269
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The moment I saw it, I started to sneeze.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The moment I arrived, I started to sneeze.

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's what I said.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That doesn't matter.

273
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I started to sneeze before I went to bed.

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I started to sneeze before I went to bed.

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What are you talking about?

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're crazy.

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I said, I'm going to sneeze.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The pig started to sneeze.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I remembered something.

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I said, I'm going to sneeze.

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The pig started to sneeze.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The pig started to sneeze.

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The pig started to sneeze.

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The pig started to sneeze.

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The pig started to sneeze.

286
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A man with a knife came and started to sneeze.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I thought it was annoying.

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I thought it was annoying.

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But it was in five seconds.

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I thought it was annoying.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The pig started to sneeze.

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The pig started to sneeze.

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,860
And did like this and did like that for a while

294
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,840
And then again, he т dis

295
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,860
And took the abOLD

296
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,340
So that guy.. was he young powder?

297
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,180
íamos a bandana, I given up

298
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,800
But who are we talking to!

299
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,780
Even if asked it's troublesome

300
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
He was hitting middle school student

301
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,440
How can that guy allow that?

302
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,040
Ah, but he's a highschooler

303
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
If I were a middle schooler, I would've hit them with a bang!

304
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
You're a high schooler!

305
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,040
If I did that, you would've definitely been beaten up!

306
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Well, I didn't hit them with a bang.

307
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Apparently, I hit them with my head.

308
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Even so, they're still allowed to do it, right?

309
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,040
No, it's like this. Everyone's like, do your best!

310
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
And they're naked.

311
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
I don't know why.

312
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
They're naked all year round!

313
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
And they're like, do your best!

314
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,040
I really wanted to hit them with a bang!

315
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
And they're like, do your best!

316
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Everyone's discriminating against animals.

317
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
It's the same with this show.

318
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
If you bully a dog,

319
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
if you grab a dog by the chest,

320
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
everyone will call you.

321
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
What are you doing to a dog?

322
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
And they'll say, Kataeya, what are you doing?

323
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Marimo, if you kick them like this,

324
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
no one will call you.

325
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,040
What kind of setting is this?

326
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Why is Marimo good, but not good with dogs?

327
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Animals aren't cute.

328
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Marimo isn't cute.

329
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
What are you talking about?

330
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
They're just staying still.

331
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
They're just fluffy.

332
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
That's right.

333
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,040
They just look fluffy.

334
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
They're cute.

335
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
If you do this to a dog, they'll come to you.

336
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
But they're not cute.

337
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,040
They're just fluffy.

338
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Marimo will come to you if you do this.

339
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Will she?

340
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Will she?

341
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
She will.

342
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
She won't.

343
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
You've never done it before, right?

344
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I've never done it before.

345
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Do you understand?

346
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,040
You guys...

347
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
You don't know much about Marimo.

348
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,040
I don't know anything about her.

349
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
If you do this,

350
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,040
if you do this,

351
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
if there's an enemy,

352
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
if there's an enemy,

353
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
you're stupid.

354
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
When you're sleeping,

355
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
does your body suddenly shake?

356
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
It does.

357
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
What's the meaning of that?

358
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Is it someone's doing?

359
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
It is.

360
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
It is.

361
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,040
I fall from a high place.

362
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I usually fall from a cliff.

363
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I know a lot about dream fortune-telling.

364
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
What does it mean?

365
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I've never heard of it.

366
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
What does it mean?

367
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,040
The width is like this.

368
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
It's a cliff.

369
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm walking like this with this width.

370
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm going like this,

371
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
but in the end, I fall.

372
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,040
That's why I kick the stove and wake up.

373
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,040
It's like this.

374
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,040
You shouldn't walk on a narrow place.

375
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,040
It's like that.

376
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Are you stupid?

377
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Who is it?

378
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm hungry.

379
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
You should wait.

380
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
You can go anytime.

381
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
I've been waiting for a while.

382
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I can't break it.

383
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
I'll let you go to the first place.

384
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
I'll let you go to the second place.

385
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Where do you want me to go?

386
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
What's coming?

387
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
What's coming?

388
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Why do animals have tails?

389
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
They get in the way when they poop.

390
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
They get in the way when they pee.

391
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Why do they have tails?

392
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
They don't get in the way.

393
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,040
But you have to lift it up.

394
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Lift it up.

395
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Should I say this?

396
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I don't think they get in the way.

397
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Why do they have tails?

398
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
They get in the way a little.

399
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
They get in the way,

400
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,040
but it's more convenient than getting in the way.

401
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
That's why they're standing.

402
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
What is it?

403
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Say it.

404
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,040
When you're walking, your tail goes down, right?

405
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
That's what you say, right?

406
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Yeah.

407
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,040
That's a static-free hat.

408
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
In here.

409
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,040
In the truck.

410
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,040
If you don't have that, you'll get in trouble.

411
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,040
That was funny.

412
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
That was okay, right?

413
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Yeah.

414
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
It happens sometimes.

415
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Yeah.

416
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I see.

417
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I really want you to study.

418
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I want you to take a note and read it tonight.

419
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I mean it.

420
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
I want you to take a note and read it.

421
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I want you to sketch the people who came to see it.

422
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,040
What's the point of sketching us?

423
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
There are foxes named after animals.

424
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
In this case, the fox is more important,

425
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
so it's in front of the monkey.

426
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
That's the reason.

427
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Isn't one of them taking more?

428
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
What do you mean?

429
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Oh, I see.

430
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,040
The fox's part is more important than the monkey's part.

431
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
That's a little different.

432
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Is that so?

433
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Then what is it?

434
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
For example, there's U-chan and Nan-chan.

435
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Nan-chan and U-chan are good.

436
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
That's why it's U-chan and Nan-chan.

437
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
This is standing position.

438
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:43,040
This is the standing position of a fox monkey.

439
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Hello, I'm a fox monkey.

440
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
That's why it's a pin.

441
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
It's not a combination.

442
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,040
It's a pin, so it's a fox monkey.

443
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
What do you mean by standing position?

444
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
This is a fox.

445
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,040
There's only one of them.

446
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
You're a fool.

447
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
There's only one of them.

448
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
There's only one of them.

449
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
When the earth was born,

450
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,040
and the life was settled,

451
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
what are you talking about?

452
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
At first, foxes and monkeys didn't exist like this.

453
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,040
At first, it was only foxes and monkeys that were combined.

454
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Originally, the two of them were doing the story.

455
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Right?

456
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Sorry, sorry.

457
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,040
They were saying that the fox monkey was weak.

458
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
They were saying that the fox monkey was weak.

459
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Who?

460
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,040
They won until the third week.

461
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Then the fifth week passed because of the fox monkey.

462
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Then the fifth week passed because of the fox monkey.

463
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm getting tired of myself.

464
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
That's it.

465
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,040
In the past, people had to make their teeth black when they got married.

466
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,040
They had to make their teeth black when they got married.

467
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
What does that mean?

468
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Why are they black?

469
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,040
It's because they have black teeth.

470
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,040
When I saw him close his mouth, I thought he was a woman.

471
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,040
When I tried to talk to him, he laughed.

472
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
It's not good.

473
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
His teeth are black.

474
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,040
I thought it was a woman.

475
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:50,040
He said, I will serve you enough to pull out my teeth.

476
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
What are you talking about?

477
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm sorry.

478
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm really sorry.

479
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I got angry because of that.

480
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Call me.

481
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Call me your servant.

482
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
What are you holding on to?
