1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,820
You're always doing these

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,000
stuff.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,980
Besides Hamada, there's be a man who don't know anything but just a little of something.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,840
He have been the most bad among all.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,880
If others find it, I think he'll famous.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,880
What is going to happen to Tomojo Matsumoto?

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,880
No, I haven't heard anything yet.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,880
Well, I'm going to try it today.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Try what?

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Well, I don't know if I can say it to an amateur, but it's serious shiragadori.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Matsumoto Shidoshi seriously challenges shiragadori.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
It's a real Japanese sword.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Well, I'll take it.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Well, I'll take it.

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Well, I don't think I should do that.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Well, it's serious.

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I've been thinking about it for about two months.

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Well, there's a guy called P-kun in Katanauchi.

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Oh, P-kun.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Well, I'll ask him.

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Well, it's dangerous.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,880
I've been doing it seriously for 10 years.

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,880
I've never taken it seriously at all.

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Are you all right?

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Are you all right?

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,880
No, I'm pretty excited.

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
If you can get the rating, you'll get it again.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,880
No, there's no problem with the rating.

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
I don't know if it's one or two.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
No, it's two.

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Oh, it's two.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
P-kun.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:45,880
P-kun.

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Masamune Mendo.

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Masamune Mendo.

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Masamune Mendo.

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
It's heavy.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:29,880
How is it?

40
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Well, I don't think everyone has seen it.

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Well, it's a little small.

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Well, it's a little small.

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,880
I don't like it very much.

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Well, it's good.

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
It's nothing.

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
What?

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,880
It's two or three million yen.

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,880
That's amazing.

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Ouch!

50
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Are you all right?

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,880
It's dangerous, really.

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
The green one is better.

53
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Oh, it's green.

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I can't use this one today.

55
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Whoa!

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
It's scary, it's scary.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,880
It's scary, it's scary.

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
It's scary.

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Let's put that away for a moment.

60
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Yeah?

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
What's this?

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,880
What do you want me to say?

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
I don't know.

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,880
I don't know.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Well, this is it.

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Wow.

67
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
It's amazing.

68
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
There's Masamune-san.

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
He's a famous swordsman.

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
It's shining.

71
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
It's heavy.

72
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
This is heavy.

73
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
It's scary.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
I'll turn it around.

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,880
It's scary.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
I can't do this.

77
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm in danger.

78
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Don't do it.

79
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I can't hold it like this.

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
What's that?

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
They don't make things like this anymore.

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Yeah.

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
They can only be made in the mountains.

84
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
There are only two people who can make this in Japan.

85
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
P-kun and A-kun.

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
P-kun and A-kun.

87
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
What?

88
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
I can't hold it like this.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,880
I can't hold it like this.

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Why are you crying?

91
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
That's it.

92
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Who makes it like this?

93
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
You do it?

94
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes.

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
I think I'll ask Hamada to do it.

96
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
What?

97
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
I don't think so.

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
I'll ask my partner to do it.

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Hamada-san.

100
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Hamada.

101
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
What?

102
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
I got it.

103
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Try it.

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
I can't hold it like this.

105
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
He's more...

106
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
He's more...

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
concentrated than I am.

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I checked the speed.

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
That's right.

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
How fast?

111
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Like this?

112
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
No, faster.

113
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Anyone can do it.

114
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Like this?

115
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Faster.

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Like this?

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Faster.

118
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Faster.

119
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Like this?

120
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Are you okay?

121
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Are you okay?

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Are you okay?

123
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Faster.

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Faster.

125
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Faster.

126
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Faster.

127
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Are you okay?

128
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Are you okay?

129
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Amazing.

130
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Amazing.

131
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Amazing.

132
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Amazing.

133
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
It was so fast.

134
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Are you okay?

135
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Are you okay?

136
00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Are you okay?

137
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Do you want to talk today?

138
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Yes.

139
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
What's so funny?

140
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
What's so funny?

141
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
What's so funny?

142
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
What's so funny?

143
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
What's so funny?

144
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,880
It's cold, so I'm happy to be inside today.

145
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Him and her.

146
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Him and her.

147
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
It's hard to wait outside.

148
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
The bath.

149
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
It's cold these days.

150
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Do you take a bath in the spring?

151
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I usually take a bath in the spring.

152
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
In winter.

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
I want to ask Dr. Matsumoto.

154
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Ask me anything.

155
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
You can ask me anything.

156
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
You can ask me anything.

157
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
I'm not a bad guy.

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm not a bad guy.

159
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
You can come if you want.

160
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
I'll send you a drink this year.

161
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I'll send you a drink this year.

162
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
I've never thought of that.

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,880
You know, when you don't put bath salts in, you can't go in with normal water.

164
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,880
When you go in,

165
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,880
you can't go up.

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
There are a lot of children.

167
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
What's that?

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
That's the movie.

169
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Did you watch the movie, Abyss?

170
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
No, I didn't.

171
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,880
There are a lot of creatures at the bottom of the sea.

172
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
There are a lot of creatures like that.

173
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
There are a lot of fairy-like creatures.

174
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Why are you a fairy?

175
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
You're protecting the animals.

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
There are a lot of them.

177
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,880
It's like a stick in the mud.

178
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
There are a lot of them.

179
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
What's wrong with that?

180
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
When you go in, you run away.

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Why do you run away?

182
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
You're protecting them.

183
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Water is weak.

184
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
You're weak.

185
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
You're protecting them, but you're weak against water.

186
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,880
What's wrong with you?

187
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,880
The enemy is too strong.

188
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,880
There are a lot of strange things.

189
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Including you?

190
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,880
There are a lot of questions.

191
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I went to a pet shop.

192
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Do you know what happens at a pet shop at night?

193
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
I don't know.

194
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,880
There are only cats and dogs.

195
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
When that happen,

196
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,880
The pool will begin.

197
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Gyo-san, you have a cat, right?

198
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,380
Yes.

199
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,380
I hear it go, meow meow meow meow.

200
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,880
First, the cat. The cat. The cat.

201
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,380
First, it starts.

202
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,880
After that, it goes,

203
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
woooow.

204
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
woooow.

205
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
The tone is completely different.

206
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
The cat goes, meow meow meow meow.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
So, the dog doesn't cover it.

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
The dog doesn't cover it.

209
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Why?

210
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
It's like a dress with a tanned chest.

211
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Why?

212
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
It's like a dress with a tanned chest.

213
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
A female dog starts with a long hair.

214
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
That's a good one.

215
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Animals speak, basically.

216
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I don't know.

217
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I don't know if they talk.

218
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
That's the same in the electric shop.

219
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Everyone comes in at night.

220
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Gyo-san, you have a stereo, refrigerator, and an iron, right?

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Yes, I do.

222
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
If you have all of them, the party will start again.

223
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
How will it be?

224
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
It will disappear, right?

225
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
It will look like an interior.

226
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Everyone will go home.

227
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
It will be dark, right?

228
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Who's in charge of the speech?

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
It's Tansu.

230
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Tansu?

231
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Tell him to go to the refrigerator.

232
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Tansu is in charge of the speech.

233
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I went to the interior.

234
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
Sorry.

235
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I went to the electric shop.

236
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Who's in charge of the speech?

237
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
The iron is in charge of the speech.

238
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
It will disappear.

239
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
It will disappear, right?

240
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
It will disappear.

241
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Five iron will be gathered.

242
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Five iron will be gathered.

243
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
What's it like?

244
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan!

245
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
This year is already over.

246
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
It was good.

247
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
No, no, it's not over yet.

248
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
It's not over yet, is it?

249
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Are you going home this New Year?

250
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Home.

251
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
You're not going home?

252
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Why?

253
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Well, it's not like...

254
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
You're not going to see your dad or grandma, are you?

255
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
You're not going home, are you?

256
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I'm not going home either.

257
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
You should go home!

258
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
You're just hanging around all by yourself.

259
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
What the hell is this?

260
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
You're just hanging around all by yourself on New Year's Day.

261
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
No, I'm going home.

262
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
You should go home!

263
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
You're so annoying!

264
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Why?

265
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,880
My mom sometimes goes home at New Year's Eve.

266
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,880
It's the day before New Year's Eve.

267
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Mom?

268
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
You don't have a man at all.

269
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,880
You have a slight beard.

270
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
When you're an old woman.

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I have one.

272
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
You're not going home, are you?

273
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm not going home.

274
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
It's New Year's Eve. You should go home.

275
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
You should go home!

276
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,880
No, I'm not going home!

277
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,880
You should go home. You should go home all by yourself.

278
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
No, I'm not going home.

279
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
You should go home.

280
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I'm not going home.

281
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Who told you that?

282
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Who told you that?

283
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
You're so stupid!

284
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm going to go home.

285
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm not going home.

286
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
You're such a pervert.

287
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Don't lie to me!

288
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Who are you talking about?

289
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Just a shoe box is enough to make you go woooow!

290
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,880
You can't say that!

291
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Why does that person have such a great house?

292
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Why does that person have such a great house?

293
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
The toilet is also a great place.

294
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Just the toilet.

295
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,880
It's really great, isn't it?

296
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It's a toilet, so it's got a lot of dust.

297
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Shut up!

298
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
But you don't take it either.

299
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Don't mess with me.

300
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
I'm jealous.

301
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
What's that?

302
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,880
It's the toilet.

303
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I've never seen it.

304
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
What are you talking about?

305
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,880
There's only one toilet in Japan.

306
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
What are you talking about?

307
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
It's great, isn't it?

308
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
What?

309
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
What?

310
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
It's great, isn't it?

311
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
You're always like this.

312
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
If you say it's great, it's great.

313
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
If you say it's great, it's great.

314
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
But I don't think we're the same kind of couple.

315
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,880
I don't have anyone when I go home at night.

316
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm hungry at night, right?

317
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,880
When I go home, I usually eat gombutoku.

318
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
I don't eat gombutoku.

319
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
By that time, you're already a Vivaldi.

320
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Why?

321
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm not eating anything like this, and I'm not listening to Vivaldi.

322
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
The pork is like this.

323
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm not doing it.

324
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Stop it.

325
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
I'm not eating pork.

326
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Where are you?

327
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
I'm in the house.

328
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
I know.

329
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,880
If you open the oven, it's going to be like this.

330
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
It's going to be like this?

331
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,880
It's going to be like a silver-haired man in boots.

332
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I'm not crying.

333
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
I'm not crying.

334
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
That's great.

335
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm popular.

336
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Where are you?

337
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Where are you looking at?

338
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,880
But I'll think about it next year.

339
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
What are you talking about?

340
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Next year, I'm going to buy land.

341
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Buy it.

342
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
What are you talking about?

343
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Get on more.

344
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm going to buy land.

345
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
What are you talking about?

346
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,880
This is the front door, right?

347
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Go-kun, come here.

348
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
What's wrong?

349
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
What?

350
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
It's okay.

351
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
It's okay.

352
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
How?

353
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Is the front door there?

354
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
This is the front door, right?

355
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Here?

356
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,880
It's going to be like this, right?

357
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
This is Hama-chan's room.

358
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Why?

359
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Why am I with Aikata-san?

360
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I have a question about dogs.

361
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
My dog, Gon, died around 3 p.m. on March 15th this year.

362
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
That's fine.

363
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
You guys died at 3 p.m.

364
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Don't laugh at me.

365
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,880
It's nothing.

366
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
He died at 3 p.m. on March 15th.

367
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,880
That's fine.

368
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
I have a question about dogs.

369
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,880
How long do dogs live?

370
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't know.

371
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,880
How long have your dogs lived?

372
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Dogs live longer if you buy them.

373
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
About 15 years.

374
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Really?

375
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
They live longer.

376
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,880
They get attracted to cars.

377
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,880
How did your dogs get dirty?

378
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
What?

379
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,880
What's wrong with my dog, Per-chan?

380
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I don't know.

381
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Didn't your dog get dirty?

382
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Don't say that.

383
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
The last one.

384
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
What?

385
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,880
My dog, Per-chan, was wearing a dress.

386
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I told you.

387
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:20,880
It was moving.

388
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,880
My dog, Per-chan, was eating.

389
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,880
He ate all of them.

390
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,880
He ate them all.

391
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
He ate them all.

392
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
He ate them all.

393
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
He ate them all.

394
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,880
What are you doing?

395
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
You ate them all.

396
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,880
I don't need your food.

397
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm just waiting.

398
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
You're annoying.

399
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,880
The other day, I went to a bookstore and found a book written in 1994.

400
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
I took a look at the book.

401
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,880
On January 0, a foreigner might come to stay over.

402
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
That's good.

403
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Will a foreigner come to my house?

404
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

405
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Wait, wait.

406
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Accept it.

407
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm sure he'll come.

408
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
I'm sure he'll come.

409
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Do you have to write it like that?

410
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
A foreigner will come to stay over.

411
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
If it's correct, it's great.

412
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
It's great.

413
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
He'll come to stay over.

414
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
That's right.

415
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
He'll come to stay over.

416
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
He'll come to stay over.

417
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I'll give him a room to sleep.

418
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
He'll eat breakfast.

419
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I'll give him a bath.

420
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
He'll watch TV.

421
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Scary.

422
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
You're scary.

423
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Good morning.

424
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Say that.

425
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
It's a nice night.

426
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Say that.

427
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Mama.

428
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
What would you like to eat?

429
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
It's the next night.

430
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Thank you for watching!
