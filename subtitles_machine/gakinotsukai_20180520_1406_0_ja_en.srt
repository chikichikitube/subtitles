1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next time, at the Gaki no Tsukai Ara, the Spring Rambunctious Badminton Competition will be held!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is good!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is good!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Badminton!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The staff will be 19.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
With badminton?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's stupid.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Is it okay?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is it okay?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is it?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's Rossi.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When Rossi came, I didn't know who else would come.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not playing badminton.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm aiming for 19 points.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not aiming for 19 points, but I'll go further.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll go further.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll do it.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What is it with Rossi?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Please calm down.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You!

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're calm.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Suddenly, Rossi appeared at the recording studio. What is his purpose?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm doing research on the future.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I succeeded in calling the future people.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Why are you doing research on the future?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm doing research on the future.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not working.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have a feeling that it's about the future.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I came here on a future day because I'm doing this.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If I were Rossi, I would like to do it again from the beginning.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But I'm not Rossi.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Rossi succeeded in calling people from the future.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now he will let me meet that person.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to get a ride.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here he comes!

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's he doing?

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's that?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He said, good morning.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a normal bike.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Is it a future scooter?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's pure white.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a future scooter!

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It says Suzuki.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's inside?

47
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,320
That's so Ami Suzuki.

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
Ami Suzuki does Ech Mog

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Ami Suzuki has a lot of

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,500
不管 16 of the world

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,260
from no I forever

52
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,060
of the future

53
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,860
or SUBSCRIBE

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,280
is decided

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
The 6th time?

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,280
It's always floating, so it becomes a wet suit.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
The Earth is changing so much.

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
It changes so much.

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
It becomes a strange phenomenon.

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
A meteorite falls on the Earth.

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
A thin one.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
It's thin and small, but it's about this big.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
It doesn't affect anything.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I don't know about that, but I'm a thin guy.

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm thin, but I'm going to be a magma.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Everyone says I'm a magma.

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
That's a magma.

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm a magma.

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
I'm a magma.

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Don't talk too much.

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm close.

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm close.

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
You're a Miyajin.

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
You're a Miyajin.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
You're not a Miyajin.

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
I didn't mean that.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
I doubt about the future.

78
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm sure of that.

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Then, let me give you some information about the future.

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I'll ask you a question that is not important.

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
This is a big deal.

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
The result is a big deal.

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,280
This is the most important.

84
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
I have three grapes and three of them.

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm curious about the first one.

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Is it C?

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Yes, yes.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,280
This is C. It was the point where a thin meteor fell here.

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
That part is popular.

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,280
C is...

91
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Chan Kawaii.

92
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Chan Kawaii.

93
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Chan Kawaii.

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
I haven't heard much about Budo.

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
No, no.

96
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I've never heard of it.

97
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Is it like that with Mr. Fukura?

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,260
That's right. There are tons of magazines about each famous person.

99
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,860
GirlsGetA chance?

100
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,860
Any current magazine that gets a chance like this can MGH2.

101
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,380
What does that mean?

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
It's a new story.

103
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
What do you mean?

104
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,380
It's a new story.

105
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
That's why the world is like this.

106
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
It's a new story like this.

107
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,380
The future is like this.

108
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
This is amazing.

109
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Do you care about the future of TV?

110
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
I do.

111
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
You do, right?

112
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
There's a TV stick.

113
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Don't you care about this?

114
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,380
I don't know anything about it.

115
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,380
This is the son of Kawasaki Mayo.

116
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,380
What kind of person is he?

117
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,380
Kawasaki Jam.

118
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,380
Mayonnaise and jam.

119
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
Kawasaki Jam.

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,380
Kawasaki Jam.

121
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
Do you have anything you want to ask?

122
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,380
What's going on with this program?

123
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
It's the first time I've seen it.

124
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,380
This is slippery. Turn it over.

125
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
Sorry.

126
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,380
You have great acupuncture power.

127
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,380
Acupuncture power?

128
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
You can use acupuncture to stick it on.

129
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
I don't have any acupuncture ideas.

130
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
It's slippery.

131
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
I can touch it with my finger.

132
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Where are you turning it over?

133
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,380
What?

134
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,380
I'm turning it over.

135
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
What was that?

136
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
The point of contact.

137
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
The point of contact.

138
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Show, you're still doing it.

139
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
I'm doing it.

140
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
It's a very important thing.

141
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
Are you okay with the magazine?

142
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
What?

143
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Magazine.

144
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,380
What is a magazine?

145
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,380
No, I'm saying.

146
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
It's a magazine, isn't it?

147
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
I'm saying.

148
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,380
You're saying.

149
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
You're saying.

150
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
The face is red.

151
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
The face is red.

152
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
The future people are not excited.

153
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
The blood will rise immediately.

154
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Is there anything else?

155
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
After all, the use of the instrument is rough.

156
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,380
That's right.

157
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,380
I'll tell you a little bit. Actually, I'm still doing this.

158
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,380
What?

159
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
I'm still doing it.

160
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
You did it?

161
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
I'll tell you a little bit.

162
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Are you okay?

163
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
What's the matter, Mr. Koki?

164
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Is it a virtual currency or electronic money?

165
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
That's a borrowed bike.

166
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,380
I borrowed the bike of Mr. Dodo of Route 33.

167
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
I don't know.

168
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,380
The Dodo of Route 33 is going to the customs to save money and go to the customs.

169
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,380
I didn't know that.

170
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
I didn't know that.

171
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,380
I don't know that.

172
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,380
The money hasn't changed, has it?

173
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
It's the same country.

174
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
This is the current one.

175
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,380
The bike is the current one.

176
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
Yes.

177
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,380
The Dodo of Route 33 will not be broken in the future.

178
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
That's right.

179
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,380
We don't have any of them now.

180
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
He's crying.

181
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,380
He even took the manager of the yakitori shop.

182
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,380
I don't know.

183
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Look at this.

184
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,380
This is the current Gaki-tsuka.

185
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Yes, it's been a year.

186
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Yes, the members have changed.

187
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
What?

188
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
16 years.

189
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,380
But the tradition of Gakitsuka has been inherited for 16 years.

190
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm sorry, but something has changed.

191
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,380
It's a pity.

192
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
This is a bit political.

193
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,380
It has changed to a New Romance rice ball.

194
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,380
This is Matsumoto's Son-taku.

195
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm not interested in it.

196
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
You're not interested in it?

197
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
I'm interested in it.

198
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,380
I don't do it on TV.

199
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,380
I don't do it on TV.

200
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
End.

201
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Sorry, End.

202
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Let's see.

203
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Let's see.

204
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,380
This is a bag.

205
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,380
Dorian's bag.

206
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,380
Dorian's bag.

207
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,380
This is a complete Hamada's

208
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,380
respect.

209
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,380
I know Nakai-in, but...

210
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
I'm not interested in him.

211
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,380
Let's see Hosei.

212
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Yamajima has changed.

213
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,380
Hosei has changed too.

214
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
Let's see Hosei.

215
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
He's dead.

216
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
Doria is dead.

217
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Hamada's choice is terrible.

218
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,380
He's totally changed.

219
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Now, it's time for the big announcement.

220
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,380
It's over.

221
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
It's not a joke.

222
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
It's from Antalya.

224
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
It's a bit tired.

225
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Matsumoto has changed.

226
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Then, only Hamada is left.

227
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Yes, so it's like Hamada Dorian's God's Day.

228
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
What's the name?

229
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,380
It's not a guy.

230
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,380
Then, it's not a guy.

231
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,380
It's not God's Day.

232
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,380
It's a red face.

233
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
It's a red face.

234
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
It's not a gift.

235
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
I'm going to put a gift on it.

236
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,380
Let's see.

237
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Who is it?

238
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
This is Takahashi Meiji.

239
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Takahashi Meiji?

240
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
No, no.

241
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
He's almost 80 years old.

242
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,380
What? 16 years old?

243
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
I don't think so.

244
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
I'm doing it with these members.

245
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,380
I'm doing it with these members.

246
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Don't be ridiculous.

247
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,380
Don't get off!

248
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
You can be close to me

249
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,380
From here, he will change into the clothes of the future

250
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,380
From the future cookie, he will learn about the future

251
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,380
I changed into the clothes of the future

252
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,380
What is the meaning of this?

253
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,380
What are you using this for?

254
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,380
This is a Tama-bikku.

255
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,380
This is when you do that.

256
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,380
It's like imitating a fire extinguisher.

257
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
It's like a fire extinguisher.

258
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,380
I don't do that.

259
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,380
Have you ever done that?

260
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
We can't do that.

261
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,380
We can't do that.

262
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,380
As a future person, I want to be in the same rank as Geno.

263
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
I want to be in the same rank as Geno.

264
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,380
The color is different.

265
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,380
If you look at Mariko Kagama, her blue cape is all the way over there.

266
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
It's so high.

267
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,380
She's wearing a cape that's all the way to her chin, and she's wearing a cape with her eyes open.

268
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
She's still wearing it.

269
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
It's amazing.

270
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Now, let's go to the grave of the future.

271
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
It's completely different from the present.

272
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Shall we go?

273
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
Yes.

274
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,380
Let's go.

275
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
First, we'll learn how to go to the grave of the future.

276
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,380
What kind of evolution is the grave 16 years later?

277
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,380
The shape of the grave itself has changed.

278
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
It's almost like a grave.

279
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,380
Tanaka, what kind of grave do you think it will be?

280
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
A grave of the future.

281
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
It's very compact.

282
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
It's small.

283
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
It's small.

284
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
It's really not a big thing.

285
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
It's a very good place.

286
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Actually, it's almost the same as a real life.

287
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,380
The land is gradually disappearing.

288
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,380
The population is increasing, the land is getting smaller and smaller, and the grave is getting bigger and bigger.

289
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,380
That's the future that's coming.

290
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
But, this small grave...

291
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,380
You're just going to come out like this, aren't you?

292
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,380
That's what they say.

293
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
It's not like that.

294
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
Anyone who wants to see the grave?

295
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Everyone?

296
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,380
This is the shape of the grave.

297
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,380
It's like a TV video.

298
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
A TV video?

299
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,380
There are so many TV programs, right?

300
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,380
And the TV programs are lying around like garbage.

301
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
So what should we do?

302
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
Let's use them as graves.

303
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,380
They are dead and burnt to the bone.

304
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,380
The bones themselves are garbage.

305
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
Let's put them together with garbage.

306
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,380
Now the graves are garbage.

307
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
By the way, look at this.

308
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
This is Hamada.

309
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,380
It's a gold fish.

310
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
It's Hamada's stomach.

311
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,380
Oh, it's Hamada's stomach.

312
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,380
My name?

313
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,380
16 years later, Hamada is gone.

314
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
I'm the only one left.

317
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,380
That's a photo of two months of 16 years.

318
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
This is a photo of two months of 16 years.

319
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,660
Like SIrongrrr

320
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,920
We call him SIrong!

321
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:39,640
....しまして

322
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,540
I called my name Siiroro

323
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,160
◆SHIRorono

324
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,520
I went to the live broadcast

325
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,240
inventing new characters

326
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,160
Get out

327
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,860
You worthless

328
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
You read it, you know it.

329
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
You read it, you know it.

330
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,860
This is the item of the name.

331
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
It's a lie. Be careful.

332
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
It's a lie.

333
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
You try it.

334
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Me?

335
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Yes.

336
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
Hama-chan likes this.

337
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
How about this?

338
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
I want this.

339
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
I want this.

340
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
This...

341
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
This is...

342
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
This is...

343
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
This is...

344
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
I see.

345
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
Ah, you only noticed it!

346
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Oh, I see.

347
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Shall I do it this way?

348
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
Stand it up, stand it up.

349
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Stand it up, and then this way,

350
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Ah, I'm starting to feel it.

351
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,860
It's really starting to look like a grave, it's disgusting.

352
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
It's a little...

353
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Then, go back, go back, that's not it!

354
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Ah, it's wet!

355
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860
It's all wet!

356
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,860
It's all wet!

357
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
It's all wet!

358
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,860
It's okay!

359
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
We can use it later!

360
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Don't talk about your concept!

361
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,860
Sorry!

362
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Don't get angry!

363
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Sorry!

364
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,860
You guys are always getting angry!

365
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Just by looking at it...

366
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
But I want to see the right answer.

367
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,860
I'll show you my drawing.

368
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
Huh? It's the same.

369
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
It's the same!

370
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,860
They're all the same.

371
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
What's the problem?

372
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
This one!

373
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
I got it right!

374
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Amazing!

375
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,860
I'm going to the toilet.

376
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,860
You can't go in the toilet.

377
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
That's not good.

378
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,860
That's why I was so angry.

379
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Why were you so angry?

380
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
I was very angry.

381
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
I'm going to watch TV.

382
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
I miss watching TV.

383
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,860
Are you happy?

384
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
I want to be by your side

385
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
I'm doing this for you

386
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
I wonder if it's possible

387
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
I did it, but...

388
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
I see

389
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
I see

390
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
I see, so you can see the individual like this

391
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
I see

392
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
I see

393
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
I can see the nostalgic video in the grave

394
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
It's not like this

395
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,860
I see

396
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,860
It's a memorial

397
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
It's a memorial

398
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
What?

399
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
From the top of the cliff?

400
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,860
That's not good.

401
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
You should have put it on the top of the cliff.

402
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Let's go to the top of the cliff.

403
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
Let's go.

404
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,860
I think it's a little overlaid on the video of the private.

405
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:33,360
The

406
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
The mistake of the shaft is that...

407
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Then let's go next.

408
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
What?

409
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,860
I'm being guided.

410
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Are you sleeping?

411
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
The magazine is strong, isn't it?

412
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Can you tell me what to do next?

413
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Why don't you turn on the engine?

414
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,860
Is it a TV video?

415
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Every time I turn on the engine and press it.

416
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,860
I feel like you're sending me to the station.

417
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
You can go home with a beautiful face.

418
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
It doesn't make sense.

419
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Next, we will learn about the future history of the world.

420
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,860
What will the 16 years of Mamemaki be like?

421
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Well, then, I'll have Hamada do the demon.

422
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,860
I'll have Hamada do the demon, so come with me.

423
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,860
They will be dressed as the 16 years old demon.

424
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,860
Demon, come out! Demon, come out!

425
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Demon?

426
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,360
A

427
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,160
Hamada-san

428
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,060
Hamada-san

429
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,560
It's a lie

430
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,260
The future Oni is like this

431
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,960
Hamada! Hamada!

432
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,560
No

433
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,960
No no

434
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,660
It's meaningless

435
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,760
It's the real Oni

436
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,760
The real Oni

437
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
It's the real Oni

438
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,060
It's meaningless

439
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
It's meaningless

440
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Even if you imitate Hamada, you are still similar to him.

441
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
Hamada is already Hamada.

442
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
That's right.

443
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
It's meaningless.

444
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
What do you want to do?

445
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
It's meaningless.

446
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
You look alike.

447
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
What do you mean?

448
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
You look like him.

449
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,620
I will now ask you to do a

450
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:49,620
You guys are trying to get us out of here, but we are trying to stay at home.

451
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,620
We are like Hamada Deva, we are sleeping.

452
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Is that a weapon?

453
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
It's wet.

454
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,620
No, no, no.

455
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,620
We are going to sleep and kill you guys.

456
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
No, I don't want to!

457
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,620
You guys are too strong!

458
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
We're just a group!

459
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
You guys have a weapon too.

460
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,620
We use our arms.

461
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,620
You guys are just a tool.

462
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
A tooth.

463
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,620
A tooth?

464
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:13,880
Instead of beans, you can use a

465
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
This is a gimba.

466
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,620
A human tooth.

467
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
A gimba?

468
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,620
While the music is playing, we'll attack you guys.

469
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
You guys don't have the right to dig it up.

470
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
The moment the music starts.

471
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,120
What?

472
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
And there are times when the music stops.

473
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
It's time for the on to stop.

474
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,620
Bang!

475
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,120
Yeah.

476
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
That's a chance.

477
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
It won't move.

478
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,620
It won't move.

479
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
It won't move.

480
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
Come on, bang bang.

481
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Then, the future of the story.

482
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
Start!

483
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
Is this song?

484
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Ah!

485
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Hey!

486
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Hey, Kota!

487
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Hey, hey, hey!

488
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
I'm sure you don't like it.

489
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,620
Scary scary scary.

490
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,620
It hurts.

491
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,620
It hurts.

492
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
It hurts.

493
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,620
Music stop.

494
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Ouch!

495
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Ouch!

496
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,620
It stopped!

497
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,620
It stopped!

498
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
Ouch!

499
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,620
Ah!

500
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
Ah, it hurts!

501
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,620
It hurts!

502
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,620
Eh? What is it?

503
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,620
What is it?

504
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
What is this?

505
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
What is this?

506
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,620
Tachō Eva

507
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
Stop it, stop it, stop it

508
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
Stop it, stop it

509
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
What are you doing?

510
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
It's Osaka!

511
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,620
Osaka!

512
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,620
Osaka...

513
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
I've never heard of Osaka like this.

514
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
The show is over!

515
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
It's over.

516
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
It's crazy.

517
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Good luck!

518
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Jinba, Jinshi.

519
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Jinba, Jinshi.

520
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Jinba, Jinshi.

521
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Hitoshi, Hitoshi, Hitoshi.

522
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
Hitoshi.

523
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Hitoshi.

524
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
Wow!

525
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,620
The best of the best

526
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,620
Now, I'd like to announce the best of the best

527
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
The person who will announce it is this person

528
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Why?

529
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
Why?

530
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Mr.Moto?

531
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,620
Mr.Moto?

532
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
He's the future

533
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
Then I'll take this

534
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
Thank you

535
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
Why?

536
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
Mr.Moto is not the future

537
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Tsuyuki-san from Fuji TV

538
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Tsuyuki-san from Fuji TV?

539
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Yes, Tsuyuki-san from Fuji TV

540
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,620
The one who did the Fuji TV announcement

541
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
It's complicated

542
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
The winner is...

543
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
Tanaka! Congratulations!

544
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
You're not supposed to be doing that

545
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Why?

546
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,620
The last time I was forced to do it, I was so scared

547
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
My chest became so heavy

548
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Congratulations.

549
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,620
I will give you a reward.

550
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,620
Then, Tsuyuki-san.

551
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
What is this?

552
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
It is a tunnel to the future.

553
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
What?

554
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
You are interested in the reward, right?

555
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,620
I will show you the future for 5 seconds.

556
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,620
That's great!

557
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
In other words, Danaka-san,

558
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
please put your face in the flapping for 5 seconds.

559
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,620
You can see the future.

560
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,620
Please tell us what kind of future you had.

561
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,620
Wow, really?

562
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
It's 5 seconds, right?

563
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
Please put your head in.

564
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,620
Put your head in?

565
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

566
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
The end!

567
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
Did you see it?

568
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,620
How was it?

569
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,620
After he said, yes, okay, the cookie was apologizing to us.

570
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
That's true.

571
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
I'm sorry.

572
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
I'm sorry.

573
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm sorry.

574
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
You made a mistake. It's 30 seconds later.

575
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
Let's go home, Suiki.

576
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
Suiki, this is not for you.

577
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Suiki, this is not for you.

578
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
Suiki, this is not for you.

579
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
Oh, it's not for you.

580
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
Adios Japanese people.

581
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Gakizuka members, thank you.

582
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,620
Let's go!

583
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
This is the worst.

584
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
This is the worst.

585
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,620
I hate this.

586
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,620
I want to do this.

587
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
Don't walk!
