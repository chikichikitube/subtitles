1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I don't even remember saying clear, clear.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're looking at me so much.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm looking at you so much.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm looking at you so much.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm looking at you so much.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I didn't say I was looking at you.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I really don't remember saying clear, clear.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But I remember it being like that.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When I said butt,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
To be honest,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I want you to touch me.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's why,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If that butt is popular,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Actually, at that time,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
To everyone all over the country,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's Miyasako's gag.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I wanted to say that this is funny with Miyasako.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Excuse me, is violence okay?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Violence is the law.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That was a few years ago.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, Tanaka.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's Yamazaki.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, good morning.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Are you free this weekend?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go to Hakone.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hakone?

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What are you going to do in Hakone?

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a hot spring, of course.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Eat delicious food, play with women,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And go to the hot spring. It's so much fun.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are you really having fun?

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's with that attitude?

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm your senior, so I can't invite you.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can just follow me.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry. I'll go. I'll go.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Tanaka wasn't very motivated,

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But he understood Yamazaki's forceful invitation.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And that day...

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Good morning.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Good morning.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yamazaki-san, what's wrong?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I fell asleep with the air conditioner on, so I'm not feeling well.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You'll be fine after you go to the hot spring.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're right.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The two got on the train and headed to Hakone.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To be honest, I wasn't motivated at first,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But now that I'm going, I have to have fun.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right, Yamazaki-san?

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Huh?

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, that's true.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
For some reason, Yamazaki, who doesn't talk much,

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And Tanaka, who seems to be having fun,

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Got on the train and arrived at Hakone.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hakone. Hakone.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yamazaki-san, we're here.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm completely asleep.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And after getting off the train, Yamazaki couldn't sleep.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it the wind? I think I have a fever.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Tanaka, can you touch my forehead?

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What? I don't have a fever at all.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You do, but you look like you have a fever.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is bad.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Even if it's bad, I'm already awake.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Then, Yamazaki...

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's go home.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go home?

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I didn't want to come, but I came all the way here.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's no use saying that.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have a cold.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Even if you say that, I don't have a fever at all.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Shut up. I'm not having fun anymore.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In this way, Tanaka and Yamazaki went back to Hakone.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tanaka was suddenly suspended from his trip because he didn't want to go.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
However, the wind of Yamazaki sleeping in the train on the way home

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Was completely healed by the time he arrived in Tokyo.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Judge, can you give your testimony?

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is terrible.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But I think Yamazaki has a fever.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He doesn't have a fever?

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is it.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I came all the way here.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yamazaki-san, let's go to the hot spring.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I told him a few times.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He got angry and said,

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you want to go that much, go by yourself.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not here for rehab.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's so fun about going to the hot spring alone?

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He invited you, didn't he?

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He told me to stay by his side.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He said that he might still have a cold.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He said that he was worried about waking him up at night.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I stayed at home for a long time.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My face turned pale.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I thought it was really hard.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's measure his fever.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When I measured his fever, it was only 7.2 degrees.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was only 7.2 degrees.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He wasted my day.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was only 7.2 degrees.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know if it's normal.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not my fault.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's your name.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's not my fault. I'll do my best from now on.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's like a name of a convenience store.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have a very low fever.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is that so?

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
34 degrees.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's not true.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I may have a fever of 39 degrees.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But you invited me from the top.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you're in a bad mood in the morning, call me and tell me to stop.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was in a bad mood from the beginning.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was in a bad mood after I got to the box.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What about that?

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was in a bad mood in Shinjuku.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I heard it with both ears.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I didn't say that.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was in a bad mood after I got to the box.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I said that I had a cold.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you catch a cold as soon as you got to the box?

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You don't have to go home if you're in a bad mood.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have a hard time when I catch a cold.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Everyone has a hard time.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Everyone has a hard time.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're the only one who has a hard time.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's sad.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's my fault.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I feel that you think a lot about me.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's annoying.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You show that you don't want to answer.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're lying.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll cry when you stop.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You look so sad.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You often talk about the stairs.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You often say,

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The culprit is you.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yamazaki says to his junior,

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The culprit is you.

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He looks surprised and says,

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The culprit is you.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong with you?

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's amazing.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's amazing that I was scared.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was on a bus.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I went into a dark alley.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There was a tree in front of the garden.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The tree hit the window.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Only one person.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's wrong with everyone?

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What's wrong with everyone?

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's terrible.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was driving on a mountain road.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's funny if I turn off all the lights.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There were three white people.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was laughing.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What's wrong with you?

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Stop it.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't stop laughing.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I said to my sister.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Stop it.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I said to my sister.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's funny.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's funny.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It was a few years ago.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yamazaki was the peak as a talent.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yamazaki has become popular recently.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm busy.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I do all the hard work, I won't be able to do it.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you appear in the show?

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I'm a regular.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I only appear once a week.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
At that time, Yamazaki and K2 appeared in the show.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But it's okay.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even if you're not a regular, you can appear in that show.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's not true.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
K2 is annoying.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Even if you're not a regular, you can appear in that show.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
K2 is annoying.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What are you laughing at?

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
K2's Horibe is a kid's writer.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I was listening to the whole story.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yamazaki forgot about Horibe.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's not true.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's not true.

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's okay.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yamazaki was so miserable that he laughed at Horibe.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Please show us.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Please explain the VTR.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
At that time, he and I were working as a regular.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
As a comedian, I wanted to appear in the show every week.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's true.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But it was a kid's show.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We wanted to make the show more exciting.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I was a writer.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I went to the dressing room.

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yamazaki and Matsumoto talked about it.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a regular, isn't it?

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's right.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
K2 is annoying.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was surprised.

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was surprised.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
K2 is annoying.

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was surprised.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was surprised.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was surprised.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you talking about?

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was surprised.

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not saying I hate K2.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm not saying I hate K2.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm just saying I want to appear every week.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm just saying I want to appear every week.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is there anything else?

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He used to drive a Mercedes-Benz.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's the owner of a Mercedes-Benz.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He used to drive a domestic car.

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When I changed the car,

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I asked Matsumoto why he bought a Mercedes-Benz.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He said,

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't drive a domestic car.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
As a comedian, I can't drive a domestic car.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
By the way, I'm driving a domestic car.

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're talking a lot.

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm talking a lot.

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm talking a lot.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm talking a lot.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is the story of when Yamazaki went to Las Vegas for the first time on Japanese TV.

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the story of when Yamazaki went to Las Vegas for the first time on Japanese TV.

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I went to Las Vegas with Mr. Shisamoto and Mr. Hakamada.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We played a game of casino roulette.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If I lost, I would have to play a penalty game.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I played without any preparation.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I lost the game.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The penalty game is a bungee jump of 50 meters.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Bungee jumping is a very delicious penalty game for comedians.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yamazaki made a face that he didn't like.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yamazaki made a face that he didn't like.

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In his heart,

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is delicious.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry for the two of you.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I, Yamazaki Hosei, will eat this program.

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
By the way,

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry for the two of you.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No problem. Thank you.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yamazaki Hosei is not good at acting.

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yamazaki Hosei is not good at acting.

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is the end of the broadcast.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have worked with various comedians so far.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I have never seen such a person who makes me disappointed.

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I was looking forward to him.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He is the worst.

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is the opening of Yamazaki Hosei.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is the opening of Yamazaki Hosei.

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is the opening of Yamazaki Hosei.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Sorry for the troubling you.

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't do that!

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll take it.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, no.

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, I'll take it.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Sorry.

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Sorry.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, no, no!

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, I'm sorry.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sorry.

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Sorry.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You don't have to.

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, I'm sorry.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll take it.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Hello.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Welcome.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hello.

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Welcome.

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Welcome.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Welcome.

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Welcome.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Welcome.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll take it.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why did you jump out?

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And in the test of courage...

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The sound is too loud.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What do you think?

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This face.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Is this a real dog?

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ah!

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah!

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was surprised.

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It disappeared.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It disappeared.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It really disappeared.

295
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And in the legendary Yamazaki vs. Jimmy dog fight...

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There is a way to use this.

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How do you use this?

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Do you use this?

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you use this?

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Do you use this?

301
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And in the test of courage...

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sit down!

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is dirty.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's dirty.

305
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ah!

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ah!

307
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh!

308
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh!

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh!

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh!

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What?

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What?

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Ah!

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh!

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What?

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And in the test of courage...

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In order to take a picture of the ghost in a haunted spot...

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There is a way to do it.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a ghost!

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ah!

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ah!

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Scary!

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Scary!

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Scary!

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Scary!

327
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Who is this?

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Ah!

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Ah!

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Ah!

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Ah!

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Ah!

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ah!

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
As expected, Yamazaki Hoosei is the ultimate horror entertainer.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is the end of the scary horror.

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What is it that you want to show Yamazaki Hoosei?

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You know, there is a big gaga in Gaito, right?

338
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There was a big gaga in Den-Chun.

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There was a big gaga in Yamazaki-san, right?

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Ah, that's right.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And then, about 5 seconds later,

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I heard another scream like this,

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and when I looked at Yamazaki-san's face,

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I saw that gaga in Yamazaki-san's face.

345
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Why is this happening?

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, it must be because the scale is small.

347
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There are various things.

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I've seen a lot of Keiba newspapers before,

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and I've bought them.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But that's because the scale is big.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's interesting!

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That was on the other hand, in Japan.

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It was yesterday's newspaper.

354
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yesterday's newspaper.

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yesterday's newspaper.

356
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The horse's name is different.

357
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Huh?

358
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This is not it.

359
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is curious, isn't it?

360
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Huh? The horse's name is different.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's what I did.

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I was expecting it to be yesterday's newspaper,

363
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
but I got it right.

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Perfectly.

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Even if you look at it again, it's nothing.

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We've received a testimony from someone

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
who is very close to Yamazaki-san.

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's take a look at it.

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Who is it?

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yamazaki Keiba

371
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yamazaki-kun's scale is small.

372
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
In the past,

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yamazaki-kun had a job in the Ultra Quiz.

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It seems that he was aiming for a step-up

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
in the Ultra Quiz at once.

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It seems that he put a lot of effort into recording,

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but to be honest, it didn't come out well at all.

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
At that time, he was young,

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and he was participating in the 99,

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and he was taken away by Okamura.

381
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Normally, there are comedians there.

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, shit.

383
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay, next time.

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Next time, I'll take back what I did the other day

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and stand out as much as I can.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll take a laugh.

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think he's a normal comedian,

388
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but in his case,

389
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
his scale is very small.

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So it means that the program is bad.

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He doesn't bring out his own charm at all.

392
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
In other words, Takeshi-san is bad.

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
He doesn't know.

394
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He's come this far.

395
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The next time he was asked to appear,

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
he refused.

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
When he appeared in Karasoyagi,

398
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
he didn't do well at all.

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If he was a normal comedian,

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
he would say,

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay, next time.

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But it's also bad for the program.

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He doesn't play with me.

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
In fact, Sanma-san is bad.

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When I was drunk,

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I asked him if he said it or not.

407
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
He's really a small guy.

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Really, Yamazaki-san...

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, Yamazaki.

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yamazaki-san.

411
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He's really small.

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You're really small.

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He's my senior.

414
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He's been my senior for two years.

415
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, his career.

416
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He's been my senior for two years.

417
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want him to be happy that his junior got a job.

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's right.

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's been my senior for a long time.

420
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When his junior gets a job, he's really happy.

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's right.

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That guy.

423
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

424
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
When he gets a job,

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
he doesn't call me anymore.

426
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He doesn't play with me anymore.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What does that mean?

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And this fall, when he lost two jobs,

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
he came to see me.

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's a good thing.

431
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm going to beat him up.

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You're really a small guy.

433
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm really small.

434
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He's really small.

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's been beaten up.

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He's been beaten up.

437
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Please,

438
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
punish him.

439
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Please.

440
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's all the evidence we have.

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yamazaki-kun, if you have anything to say, please say it.

442
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't know if I can say it's an incident,

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
but I admit that there was a lot of things.

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But,

445
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
he's cute, isn't he?

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Did you just hear the voice of the public?

447
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It came out from the bottom of my stomach.

448
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Then, if you have anything to say, please say it.

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Please punish him.

450
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He's cute, isn't he?

451
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He's like this.

452
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's no way he's a judge.

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What about me?

454
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm a defendant.

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now,

456
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what should I do?

457
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Please erase it.

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Please erase it.

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Ah,

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
then,

461
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the Chief Justice,

462
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Matsumoto Shintoshi,

463
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
will announce the verdict.

464
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The fact that the defendant, Yamazaki Hosei,

465
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
has been causing trouble to many people

466
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
because of his small scale

467
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is an irreplaceable fact.

468
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He has far exceeded our expectations.

469
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Therefore,

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
regardless of whether or not the defense is ready,

471
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
the verdict will be

472
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a one-man piano concert at midnight.

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is that true?

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Please play the piano at a night school

475
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
where no one is around.

476
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
All night long.

477
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why do you have such a back?

478
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well, basically,

479
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm a defendant,

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and I'm not a lawyer.

481
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Thank you.
