00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yōkan Fusai wa nakayoshi da

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Matsumoto, who has made many great songs, has recently made a song for the Dango Brothers.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This time, we will invite a great singer to do a public recording of Yōkan Fusai.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't look down!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is Matsumoto's first public recording of Yōkan Fusai, written and composed by Yōkan Fusai!

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello!

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're finally here.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, I am.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The song you recorded before was a temporary song.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So this time, you're going to do it with a book in your hand.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Who are you going to sing it to?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The vocalist.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There's no one else but this person, right?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's right.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't think you want to get involved too much, but let's get involved.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's right.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It can't be helped.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It can't be helped.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's do it.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's have two real entertainers sing Yōkan Fusai.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please appear!

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How is it?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm wondering what it's like to have two real entertainers.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's really fun.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why am I playing the husband?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, the husband is over here.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why did you ask me to wear a dress?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What kind of school are you in?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This time it's the other way around.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Of course.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to sing, but I'm going to ask the couple.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can this guy sing?

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Certainly, there is a problem with his singing ability.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If he can't sing, he can't sing.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't have that kind of singing ability.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You are a person who makes a contribution to Yōkan.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You have to sing mainly.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But is it really a song?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a song.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because there is a band.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We will do a band.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's live.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's live.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it different from karaoke?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not karaoke, it's a live band.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you going to do?

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you going to do?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to play the piano.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Endo is going to play the foot bass.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wait a minute.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is a foot bass?

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Foot bass.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is it a foot bass?

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is it a foot bass?

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a foot bass.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a foot bass.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it really a foot bass?

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to play the foot bass.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then?

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to play the drums.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The rhythm is the hardest thing to sing.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you okay?

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't think about that kind of thing.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Think about it.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But I'm going to write it down.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to write down the rhythm.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Have you ever heard of it?

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, no?

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you?

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What a rude woman.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a song for three brothers.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why don't you listen to it once?

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's listen to it once.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can do it live.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's listen to it once.

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you ready?

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you ready?

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yo-kan, kan, kan.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yo-kan is a red color.

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's the same as always.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yo-kan, kan.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yo-kan's wife.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The night is beautiful.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yo-kan.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, my God.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, my God.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait a minute.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is that a song?

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you going to sing that?

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's okay if you sing it with soul.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's like a syncopation.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's a syncopation.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's okay.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll change it a little bit.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's only up to number one, but from now on, it's up to number three.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it up to number three?

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are other things to dance to.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is that song up to number three?

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can you do a headspin?

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Break dance.

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Break dance.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Break dance.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's great.

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's what a trainee should do.

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you okay with robot dance?

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know why this happened.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But I'll ask you this.

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Everyone, you should open the New Year's Eve party.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't tell you much.

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't tell you much.

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You should open the New Year's Eve party.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Year of the Ox.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Year of the Ox?

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Year of the Ox?

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can't open it at the New Year's Eve party?

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Year of the Ox.

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't open it at the New Year's Eve party.

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then what should we start with?

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, I see.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The lyrics board.

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Is this okay?

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wait, wait, wait.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What is this?

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is why you should go in.

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What?

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is you.

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why Ako-san said,

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Youkai and I are good friends.

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We always drink water together.

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It means you don't need water, right?

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No way.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You have to go in here.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You have to go in smoothly so you don't get in the way.

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Youkai's husband.

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Youkai's wife.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is EI, right?

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Youkai's husband.

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can call her that.

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Me?

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then you can do a light reaction.

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Subway reaction.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Youkai's wife.

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wife.

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then you can do a reaction.

163
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then you can say,

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The night is the year of the ox.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait a minute.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What is this?

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Isn't it obvious?

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The night is the year of the ox.

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What kind of face is that?

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait a minute.

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm embarrassed after a long time.

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No way.

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's okay.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's okay.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's the one who says this.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're a clumsy type.

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why am I clumsy?

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not.

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's start the rehearsal with Matsumoto's instructions.

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go.

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The night is the year of the ox.

183
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait a minute.

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is that song like that?

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's called the night is the ox.

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What do you think of this part?

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is the first part.

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right.

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's like this.

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I see.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The night is the year of the ox.

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The night is the year of the ox.

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait a minute.

194
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you doing?

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The drums are wrong.

196
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Really?

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The night is the year of the ox.

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll count the beat.

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The night is the year of the ox.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not like this.

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do it more clearly.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's wrong.

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How do you do it?

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know how to move forward.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Just make it bigger.

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do it more clearly.

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do it more clearly.

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Try it.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's wrong.

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How do you do it?

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's not like this.

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Do it more clearly.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's wrong.

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's wrong.

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's wrong.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We don't know how to do it.

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The piano is the most accurate.

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Match the piano.

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's do it again.

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is a hard work.

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The night is the year of the ox.

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We are always together.

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait a minute.

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's hard to see.

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Is the piano right?

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's right.

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's good but it's not good.

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How do you do it?

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do it more clearly.

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's wrong.

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know how to do it.

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know how to do it.

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's wrong.

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's wrong.

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's okay.

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How do you do it?

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's not good.

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's not good.

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's weird.

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's okay.

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know.

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Really?

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's do it.

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's do it.

250
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's do it.

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know how to do it.

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's weird.

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know.

254
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know.

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The night is the year of the ox.

256
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay.

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How do you do it?

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Beautiful.

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is good.

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's not bad at all.

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't need a lyrics.

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's okay.

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's good.

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know what he says.

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really?

266
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's okay.

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's okay.

268
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's go next.

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's go to number two.

270
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Number two.

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Number two?

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You should go.

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Number two is Yokan-san and Nakabushi-san.

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yokan's husband is a technician.

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That hand and this hand is a bean yokan

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ah, Zen-Gi

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What?

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Zen-Gi is a bean

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am? Ah, Zen-Gi

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The husband of a yokan is the wife of a yokan

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The husband is a plum yokan

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It means he is sick

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Ah, this is ***

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wait a minute

285
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can this be broadcasted?

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's okay

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This kind of...

288
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Wait a minute

289
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I will sing this to the singer that I took from Kouhaku

290
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I will sing this

291
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's go to number 2

292
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If you go too far, it will be like

293
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you go too far, it will be like

294
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You don't have to look over there

295
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's right

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's right

297
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's why this *** is not a yokan

298
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's why when you say ***

299
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
At that time, the girl will be like

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I will erase it

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Erase it

302
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Erase me

303
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
With the feeling of erasing

304
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You don't have to say that

305
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I have to say that

306
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I will say a line

307
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What?

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
At the end, at the place where you are not sick

309
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You

310
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes

311
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I like you

312
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I like you if you think about it

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you die, I will die

314
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's long

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you die, I will die

316
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If you think about it, I will die

317
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You just want to say yokan

318
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You don't have to sing

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You don't have to sing

320
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I will sing

321
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Listen to that

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Good day, crab balls

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
How do you sing that?

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Then I will go to number 3

325
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I will say number 3

326
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Number 3

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yokan, you are not sick

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Always in bed, bug yokan

329
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You are in bed

330
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yokan's husband, yokan's wife

331
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Today also bug yokan

332
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know if I don't say this

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I will say a line and it will be completed

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is that so?

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You haven't done anything yet

336
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't think you can do this

337
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What are you talking about?

338
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a mess

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I forgot the melody

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yokan, you are not sick

341
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Always in bed, bug yokan

342
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You are in bed

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yokan's husband, yokan's wife

344
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tonight also bug yokan

345
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You are in bed

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yokan, you are not sick

347
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Always in bed, bug yokan

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yokan's husband, yokan's wife

349
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Tonight also bug yokan

350
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I like you

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I like you

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I like you

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Wait a minute

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Stop stop

355
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a mess

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a mess

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's sort it out

358
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The song itself is a mess

359
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I put in a lot of lines

360
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There was quite a bit

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What should I do now?

362
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are always saying ha ha

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Shut up

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Can you be more firm?

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Shut up

366
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why are you saying shut up?

367
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You guys don't do that

368
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What should I do?

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
My lyrics

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The lyrics are good

373
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's not good if everyone does it

374
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The sound is not recorded

375
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Do it again

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Why is the sound not recorded?

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's not good

378
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Do the bass

379
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yokan's husband, yokan's wife

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Tonight also bug yokan

381
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's the only thing you remember

382
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You are mistaken

383
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yokan's husband

384
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will try it

385
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will go home

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I will go home

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yokan's husband is a good friend

388
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
They always watch together

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You are acting

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Follow me

391
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000

Let's go Ako

393
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Let's go

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The lyrics are not good

395
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's getting serious

396
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you okay?

397
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm okay

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's good

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yokan's husband

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not good

401
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's not good

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Wait a minute

403
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I remember it

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I tried to remember it

405
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I tried to remember it

406
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I tried to remember it

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I tried to remember it

408
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yamazaki can't play well

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So he asked a teacher to help him

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yokan's husband is a good friend

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They always watch together

Yokan's husband

413
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't get it

414
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yokan's husband is a good friend

415
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They always watch together

416
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yokan's husband is a good friend

417
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yamazaki can't play well

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I will go home

419
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you okay?

420
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yokan's husband

421
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Are you okay?

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why?

423
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The people watching are strange

424
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm teaching him

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Where?

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's okay

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The image

428
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Let him do it

429
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What are you going to do?

430
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can't play the bass

431
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The drums are strange

432
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm doing my best

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is the limit

434
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The best you can do?

435
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When did you start?

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yesterday

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Hey

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Really?

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Sorry

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I did it in a hurry

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you okay?

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm okay

443
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No one is bad

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No one is bad

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What are you going to do?

446
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I will do it with Masa

447
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Like I'm teaching

448
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Really?

449
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Can you play it again?

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yokan's husband

451
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000

Yokan's wife

455
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The night is coming

456
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Akiko is singing

457
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Let him do it

458
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But

459
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's none of your business

460
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I can't sing because I want to sing

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't sing

462
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I can't sing

463
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't sing

464
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I understand

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What?

466
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't need you

467
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I will sing in acapella

468
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You can do it later

469
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's difficult

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Is it over?

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No more

472
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No more?

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000

476
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Really?

477
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And

478
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And?

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Let him do it

You are sick

496
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I love you

You can do it

507
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Good

508
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I think it's good

509
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is it?

510
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What is it?

511
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What is it?

Do it again?

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who told you to do it?

514
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You are the producer

515
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You are the producer

What is this?

529
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
When will you finish this?

530
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
In 2005

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why?

532
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Will you use this for the next show?

533
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Of course

534
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Really?

535
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I just decided

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I will appear in Heihei

537
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Wait a minute

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's OK
