1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first episode of the show is with Chikizu! New characters discovered!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Masumoto Hitoshi and Producer Hichihenge!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What is it? New characters discovered?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been a while since we've had a show with Hichihenge

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's been a while

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's been a while since we've had a show with Hichihenge

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can you take a look?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We've been doing this all along

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So far, Kogoriko Tanaka is the first

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He won 40,000 yen

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have to get him out of this

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've been thinking about it

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When it comes to that, there are only amateurs

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I see

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I mean, aren't you an amateur?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I'm an amateur

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm trying to find a new character

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I almost gave up

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Right?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I was shocked when I saw Sen-sen-shu and O-fuku-binta

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That kind of character

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is it?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's Ichimoku-san

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's nothing to do with an idol

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a new character

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What are you doing?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a new character

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He's licking his nose

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He's licking his nose

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's amazing

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not talking to anyone

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He's licking his nose

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is it

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Yamato-soul that we almost forgot

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When I saw him

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yamato-soul

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's what I thought

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I heard that if you boil too much hijiki, it becomes like this

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He said it's not human

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is that so?

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then you should make more in this program

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What should I do?

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's been a while since I've been to Yamasaki

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've just moved

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What?

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I thought it wouldn't work

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why not?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've just moved to Ikodate

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's okay

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not a problem

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I feel calm

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I feel calm

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Onuma Fujiwara's rebellion

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We are not raccoons

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I know that

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know if this is okay

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is that so?

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's okay

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can also fish in Tanaka's world

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Even if you go alone

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not interested in fishing

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's right

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Cyborg and Suwa Kobayashi

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Cyborg

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't like that

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Cyborg's first challenge

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hey, is Takasu Koseisaka really interesting?

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm a pot

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is that so?

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a serious story

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yamasaki, put it in

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It was dangerous

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, it's perfect

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Next

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing?

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Introduce your wife

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Introduce my wife?

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Introduce my wife

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to see your wife

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to see

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ayappa

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ayappa

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ayappa

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If it goes on like this

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It will be a dinner party at Yamasaki

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm tired

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's okay if it's like bowling

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was doing it

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I dropped it from above

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Someone broke it

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It will take a whole year

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It will take a whole year

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why are you making such an unpleasant face?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Can you all be patient?

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The trip was interesting

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Trip?

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hot spring?

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Isawa?

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Isawa?

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's domestic

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Everyone seems to have fun

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What are we going to do next?

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are we going to do next?

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What are we going to do next?

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Monura

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Irogappa

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Irogappa

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yuri

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Minami

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Writer

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I remember

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Writer is dirty

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But it's Monura

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you ever brought your sister here?

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She says wow

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm surprised

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Amazing

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She says as expected

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:54,000
She says as expected

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I met Ujiie-san yesterday

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was told about the wedding

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I wonder if there will be a wedding

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who is this person?

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ujiie-san's girlfriend

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
She says gas

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What should I do?

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who is it?

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was told it was a wedding

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's an old movie

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We brought someone from somewhere

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What about the pants?

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's the first time

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's the first time, so it won't imitate

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's stupid

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't see it

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to go in

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hurry up

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll do it

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll do it

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is it

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
37,000 yen

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
37,000 yen

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The ad-lib of the mother standing on the desk

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's an ad-lib

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I said I wanted to do it

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I had an ad-lib

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I said I wanted to do that

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going to work with everyone from today

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Are you friends?

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm Kokoriko's junior

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm good at jokes

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I like to tell stories

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't do that

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Take her away

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sorry

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Take her home

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Did you notice?

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There's no monitor in the hall

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There isn't

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Put it in the middle

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What is it?

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What is it?

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a commercial that only happens in Osaka

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It only happens in Osaka?

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It only happens in Osaka

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Really?

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can only see it in Osaka

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I understand

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll show you

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll tell you a story

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's hard

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's my first time too

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Osaka's famous Okonomiyaki

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know it, right?

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Write it down

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okonomiyaki

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Mishin's Okonomiyaki

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Toshi, I made a song about Okonomiyaki

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okonomiyaki for dinner

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mishin's Okonomiyaki

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's amazing

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's a scary family

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Toshi, go home

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is that so?

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The egg is falling

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Tissue

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The egg is falling

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The egg is falling

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hurry up

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hurry up, I have to go to school

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You all talk too much

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't understand what you're saying

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's a match bomb

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't understand

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can't do this anymore

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thank you

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You have to watch it

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's right

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yesterday

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There was a stupid guy

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's been a long time

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was in the car with Kim

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There was a guy who didn't let me in

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I was worried about him

230
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I wanted to see his face

231
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The guy who didn't let me in tried to go to the left

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He stopped in front of me

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Then Kimura sat down

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He opened the window and yelled

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Shut up!

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He is really bad

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't want to see him

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I didn't want to see him but I wanted to do something

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I wanted to do FUXX YOU

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There is no one who wants to do that

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't want to see him but I wanted to do FUXX YOU

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I didn't know how to do FUXX YOU

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I didn't know what to do

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I didn't know how to do it

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I didn't know anything

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know what Kimura and I are doing

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is this?

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What is this?

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't understand

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I didn't understand

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You wanted to do this

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I wanted to do this

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I couldn't do it because I was weak

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I wanted to do this

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was very strong so I couldn't do it

256
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I wanted to do this

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I couldn't do it

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I didn't want to see him

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I didn't want to see him but I wanted to do FUXX YOU

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was easy

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You were attacked

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You said, it was last night

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You said that

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was not attacked

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't say that

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You have to blur it

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was hard

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can't do that!

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You can't do that!

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Is it a zoo?

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's not a zoo.

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It stinks?

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't you see goldfish or tropical fish?

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's strange.

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There might be some goldfish sometimes.

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What's that?

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Isn't it a little fish?

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's that?

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What's so funny?

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You have a family.

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm thinking of buying an animal.

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What do you want to buy?

283
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A dog, of course.

284
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You sound like a dog lover.

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He's a man.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's not true.

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What do you really want to buy?

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I want to improve my image.

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What you really want to buy is a magazine.

290
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I want a big magazine.

291
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
A mansion, right?

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You can't buy it, can you?

293
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's right.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

295
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What the f**k?

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I want a vacuum cleaner.

297
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What?

298
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What?

299
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't have a dog.

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I want a vacuum cleaner.

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's funny.

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You look like a dog.

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I see.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I see.

305
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're pushing a dog lover.

306
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't know.

307
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I really like dogs.

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You want to get inside a dog.

309
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's strange.

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You want to get inside a dog.

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If a cat is cute, you want to get inside a dog.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I know that.

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You want to get inside a dog.

314
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You want to get inside a dog.

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You want to get inside a dog.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Thank you.

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Who is the 2nd place in the world?

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What is Hamada-san's rank?

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What the f**k?

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll say it.

322
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The 2nd place is...

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oda Mudo.

324
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're making fun of me.

325
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
No, no.

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have a lot of fans.

327
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
1st and 2nd place?

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

329
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's the only answer I can give.

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And Hamada-san.

331
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't have a rank.

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You don't have a rank.

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You don't have a rank at all.

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't have a rank.

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You don't have a rank.

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
About 4 years ago...

337
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was in the 170th place.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But...

339
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The 170th place is Tai.

340
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's the same person?

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I see.

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Other than that, it was the same as Kano Jigoro.

344
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Kano?

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He's the old man who made judo.

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How old is he?

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's not the way you think it is.

348
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why is he 1st place?

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It has nothing to do with that.

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm talking about the 1st place in the world.

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm always out of rank because I say things like that.

352
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He's 1st place.

353
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Everyone thinks, what's the 1st place?

354
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What's the 1st place in the world?

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think it's wrong to ask what's the 1st place in everything.

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's the 1st place in the world.

357
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So if you look at me and think I'm the 1st place in the world, you're wrong.

358
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Do you understand?

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's hard to be the 1st place in the world.

360
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A lot of things.

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like greeting people.

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You have to make a name tag.

363
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's hard.

364
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't want to be the 1st place in everything.

365
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But I've always been the 1st place in the world for 7 or 8 years.

366
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Who decides?

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The world.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Your story is all in the background.

369
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He's the model of the popular manga, Sakiage Otokojuku's Heihachi Edajima.

370
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Men are told that they should only cry 3 times in their lifetime.

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When is that 3 times?

372
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When men are born, they cry.

373
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is the first time.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This is when I was born.

375
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yoroshiku.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is when I was 1 year old.

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No one can control this.

378
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's right.

379
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's your performance.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's your first performance.

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This is when you cry.

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Let's use this once.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is the next time you cry.

384
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
There are only 2 more times.

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's the next day.

386
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The next day?

387
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's too early.

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Too soon.

389
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's the next day?

390
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You have to say it again that you were born yesterday.

391
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You said it yesterday, but it's Yoroshiku.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You have to say it again the next day.

393
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It has to be 3 times, right?

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's the first time when you're born.

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The first time when you're born.

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The next time when you're born.

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You cry because you cried when you were born.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't get it.

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't get it either.

400
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The last time.

401
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

402
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Stop it!

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't pull out your nails!

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Stop it, Takushi.

405
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going home.

406
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Stop it, Takushi.

407
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Stop it.

408
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll call you when I'm home.

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes, please.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's the next day.

411
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What is it?

412
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What is it?

413
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Why are you asking?

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What is it?

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's the first time when you're born.

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's the first time when you're born.

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You have to say it quickly.

418
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What is it?

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What is it?

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You have to say it.

421
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're a child.

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
When I'm home, put a smile on your face.

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Put a smile on your face.

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Put a smile on your face.

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Put a smile on your face.

426
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Put a smile on your face.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm satisfied with the answer.

428
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm satisfied with the answer.

429
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yamada-kun pretends to lift one sheet of the futon.

430
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He's going to take it all.

431
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He's going to take it all.

432
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

433
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know either.

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I want to ask my father to write the answer.

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I want to ask my father to write the answer.

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What should I do?

438
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What do you think?

439
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's easy.

440
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Is it a direct answer?

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Is it a direct answer?

442
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Kami-san.

443
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I want you to tell me directly.

444
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I want you to tell me directly.

445
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's go to the restaurant.

446
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's go to the restaurant.

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This is the restaurant.

448
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What do you want to eat?

449
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Pork cutlet.

450
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Pork cutlet.

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You can say it.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Pork cutlet.

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I want to eat pork cutlet.

454
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Pork cutlet.

455
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can't do it.

456
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Should I ask my father?

457
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Should I ask my father?

458
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Are you going to ask your father?

459
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Either way can be good.

460
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You have to run away.

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I have to ask my father.

462
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I have to ask my father.

463
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I have to ask my father.

464
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You can't do that.

465
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Turn around.

466
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
No, no.

467
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Even if you do that, I won't let you go first.

468
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's hard.

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's hard.

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Press it again.

471
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thank you very much.

472
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I want to push it from here.

473
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll play the ending again.

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll push it from here.

475
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
How many times do you want to go?

476
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
How many times do you want to go?

477
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Tell me from the beginning.

478
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You'll go, right?

479
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:23,000
