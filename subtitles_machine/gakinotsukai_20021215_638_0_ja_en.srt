1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, we have Yoshimoto-Kamayaki Combi vs. Shinkuro-Senshika!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we have Yoshimoto-Kamayaki Combi.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're the Combi, aren't you?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What do you mean by Combi?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're going to combine them?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, I'm going to combine them with Combi.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Combi that will participate in this tournament is our regular team.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, the back row.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who are you?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We've been together for the longest time.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Lately, I rarely get involved with people who are older than me.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're older than me, aren't you?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm older than you, though.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're older than me, aren't you?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm older than you, though.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm older than you, though.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm the leader of the team!

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now, the back row.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who are you?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm Shoji Shinagawa.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nice to meet you.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm Shoji Shinagawa.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I wonder if it'll be okay.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What about over there?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's finally here. Please take care of it.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's the first time, isn't it?

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's been two years, hasn't it?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
License!

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
License!

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We've never done anything like this before.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is the Combi's life.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We'll see how well it goes.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If it's like that, it doesn't matter.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It'll definitely go well.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We'll do our best.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
As expected, there was nothing.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Everyone, this is for practice.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why is it for practice?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's for girls.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is for girls?

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's strange.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's for girls.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's our first time doing a synchro.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course, we need a teacher.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Please come out.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nice to meet you.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The first member of the boys' synchro club, Fuwa Hisashi.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He was in charge of the choreography for the movie, Water Boys.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He'll be our coach today.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This teacher.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Teacher?

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's a teacher.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Stop it.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's a teacher.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You can get angry.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Teacher, please teach us from the beginning.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The first female member will demonstrate.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Please take a look.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Please.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wow.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Wow.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wow.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She's not standing up at all.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She doesn't usually use her legs.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wow.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wow.

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wow.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wow.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the first time I've seen this.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wow.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Wow.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wow.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wow.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Wow.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is amazing.

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wow.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Wow.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wow.

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Amazing.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wow.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wow.

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wow.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Wow.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Amazing.

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Can you do that?

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can you do that?

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can you do that?

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Can you do that?

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please teach us properly.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The first is the practice of floating in the water.

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Use your hands to make your body float.

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
First, the Ritton Investigation Corps.

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why are you moving your legs?

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can't move your legs.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can't move your legs.

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Huh?

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can't move your legs.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's wrong with you?

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've never seen you float.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Next, the Kokoriko challenge.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're good.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're good.

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Your eyes are different.

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's still too hard to talk.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Next, the Yamasaki-Komurasaki combination.

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you okay?

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's wrong with you?

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What?

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What?

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What?

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are...

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are...

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your name is...

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yama-chan, you're amazing.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're amazing.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Can you raise your legs a bit more?

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Can you raise your legs a bit more?

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right, raise them a bit more.

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What is this?

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was a bit dark.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is good.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is good.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is amazing.

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Next is the practice of smiling.

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Next is the practice of smiling.

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
First, the teacher's demonstration.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's disgusting.

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's disgusting.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's disgusting.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's disgusting.

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Isn't that something to burp?

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't that something to burp?

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Isn't that something to burp?

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now, each duo challenges their smile.

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
First up is Shouji Shinagawa.

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What are you doing?

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're dirty.

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And you jumped here.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't smile.

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't cry.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't make me cry.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Next up is Riko Kokori.

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you doing?

154
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why are you like this?

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't put your chin out.

156
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why are you like this?

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was going to show my front teeth, but I was like this.

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Next up is Downtown.

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm ready.

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you doing?

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm scared.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please open your eyes.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why did you open your eyes when I came out?

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I was going to make you laugh, but I didn't.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What kind of face is that?

166
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please open your eyes. I'm really going to make you laugh.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was going to make you laugh.

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was going to make you laugh.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Your eyes are white.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your eyes are white.

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your teeth are terrible.

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was going to make you laugh, but I didn't.

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your teeth are terrible.

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Your teeth are terrible.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Your teeth are terrible.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The last one is a big move.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a lift where one person stands on top of the other person's shoulders and poses.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
However, this lift is quite difficult for beginners.

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's difficult, and every combination fails.

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yamasaki and Komorosaki's combination is...

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't lift my body.

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm going to die.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to die.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't lift my body.

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to die.

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Downtown finally challenges the lift.

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What kind of combination will it be?

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you letting go of me?

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey, you idiot.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
My hand is also a hand.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is also a hand.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a balance.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can do it.

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can do it.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can do it.

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can do it.

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can do it.

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Amazing.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You did it.

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You did it.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is amazing.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's like Rolls Royce...

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's like Rolls Royce...

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The synchronization practice is over.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
From now on, each combination will be divided and practiced for the competition.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Which combination will show us a great synchronization?

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The lesson is over.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's time for the competition.

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm a little nervous.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll explain the rules.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There are three judges over there.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They each have 10 points.

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A total of 30 points. This is the highest score.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know why they each have 10 points.

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you know that?

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't think they have 10 points.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
From now on, we will begin the competition.

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Entry number 1.

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Kokoriko's 10 years of love.

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Amazing.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Beautiful.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's beautiful.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The background is completely different.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's beautiful.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're laughing.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're good.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Are you okay?

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Tanaka is always slow.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's beautiful.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's beautiful.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's better than I thought.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The current score is 24 points.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What do you think?

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I think it was perfect.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think it was beautiful.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think it was beautiful.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Entry number 2.

238
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Shouji Shinagawa's Love Celebration 2002.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is that title?

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's like this.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You guys are the same.

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Shouji has a very good body.

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Shinagawa has one leg.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Shinagawa is not laughing.

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's not easy.

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're smart.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's a big move.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a big move.

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a big move.

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a big move.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's amazing.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's coming out.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's coming out.

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's Titanic.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's a beep

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's a beep

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's dirty

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't be fooled

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's not a trick

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not a trick

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He's being fooled

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a trick

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's just a scratch

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I wonder how the judges will judge

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The current score is...

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
25 points

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He got it right away

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He got it right away

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't have any gold left

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Entry number 3

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
All men are beautiful

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Entry number 3

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All men are beautiful

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's the title?

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
These two are close to 50 points

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Really?

277
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's too early

278
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Really?

279
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's too early

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The shape is bad

281
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's dangerous

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's dangerous

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's dangerous

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's difficult

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know what to do

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's like a joke

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's difficult

288
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm just answering

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm just answering

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't look

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm embarrassed

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't look

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm embarrassed

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can't look

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I can't look

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's over

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's over

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
As long as you look at him

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
As long as you look at him

300
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The current score is...

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
15 points

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He got it right away

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He got it right away

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's too early

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's too early

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's too early

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's too early

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Have you Arg Можно?

309
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's too early

311
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's too early

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's too early

313
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I can't look

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't look

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can't look

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a big deal

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,520
He's done

318
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Wow!

319
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
This is a great song to listen to.

320
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
This is the tempo!

321
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Wow!

322
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
This is great!

323
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
There's plenty of room for improvement.

324
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Wow!

325
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Yeah!

326
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520

343
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm so angry right now!

345
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
That's a great dance.

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Konno's smile is dirty!

351
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520

357
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I don't know which one is the best?

358
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
What is this?

359
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm not sure.

360
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
I don't know.

361
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
What is this?

362
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I don't know.

363
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
I don't know.

364
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
I don't know.

365
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
What is this?

366
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I don't know.

367
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I don't know.

368
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
What is this?

369
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
The last one is...

370
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Oh, oh, oh...

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Kawasaki has never done this before!

372
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
What is it?

373
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Oh, oh, oh, this is it!

374
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520

Really?

379
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
This is a bit strange.

380
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
It's the top!

381
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Wow!

382
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Thank you very much.

383
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
What is it?

384
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Everyone, please give us your answer.

385
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Huh?

386
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Everyone, please give us your answer.

387
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Hey, Matsuura Aya!

388
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Well then, finally...

389
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
That's right, finally!

390
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
To be honest, I was looking at it, but...

391
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Well, well, well...

392
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
You guys are pathetic.

393
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Really?

394
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I can't tell at all.

395
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
What is it?

396
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
It's not integrated with water.

397
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Why don't you talk to the water more?

398
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Talk?

399
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Is that okay?

400
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
But it's the oldest combination, right?

401
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
That's right.

402
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
It's been 20 years, right?

403
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Of course, of course.

404
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Then please watch our way of life!

405
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Okay!

406
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Entry No. 6

407
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
In Downtown

408
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,520
The two of them are at the lake.

409
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
What's a lake?

410
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Ah, here it comes.

411
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Here it comes.

412
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
The smile of the person behind you is different.

413
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
That smile is different.

414
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
It's not a smile.

415
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
It's not a smile.

416
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Your father is a great man.

417
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Here it comes.

418
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Ah, here it comes.

419
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Ah, here it comes.

420
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Here it comes.

421
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Here it comes.

422
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
You're breathing well.

423
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Yes.

424
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
As expected.

425
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
What?

426
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
What?

427
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
Get in the water!

428
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Get in the water!

429
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Well, get in.

430
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Get in.

431
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Here it comes.

432
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Hey!

433
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Is the song over?

434
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Ah, get in.

435
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Get in.

436
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
What?

437
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
What?

438
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
In the water?

439
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
What?

440
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
The appeal is the best.

441
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
You can't clap like this.

442
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
What is this?

443
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
You're not talking to the water at all.

444
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
What is this?

445
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
What is this?

446
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
It's just a hat.

447
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
It's just a hat.

448
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
The current score is...

449
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
30 points.

450
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Hey!

451
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Hey!

452
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Hey!

453
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Hey!

454
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Hey!

455
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Hey!

456
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Hey!

457
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm getting angry.

458
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
What is this?

459
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I got 30 points.

460
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I got 30 points.

461
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
I got 30 points.

462
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Wait.

463
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Wait.

464
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Wait a minute.

465
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Full marks.

466
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Wait a minute.

467
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
That's not it.

468
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Yoshimoto Synchro Championship.

469
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
The winner is...

470
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Downtown.

471
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Now, we will present the gold medal...

472
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:28,520
to Mr. Yoshimoto Synchro.

473
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
This is strange.

474
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Thank you.

475
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:52,520
