1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In front of the stage of Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Your dad is a fisherman, right?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm a fisherman, not a fisherman

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're lying

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, I'm not

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's a weird lie

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm going to put on a character

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Can these two sell?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think they're going to sell

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll have to do my best

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry to interrupt, but

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You have a channel called Nittere, right?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Koho

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The manager of Downtown asked me to do it

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The one with the hat?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nittere-chan

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're Nittere-chan too

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nittere-chan is the best in the world

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okamoto-kun or him

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Isomata

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't remember

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okamoto did it before

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He did it

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What was it?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He did it

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Isomata can do it

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Isomata can do it

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The two of you can choose

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll do it

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll do it

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No, Nittere-chan

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I just said it

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You did it before

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Grand Prix Okamoto

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I won't give you a chance

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Last time, the Japanese TV spot CM

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The manager Okamoto

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He ignored the theory

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He came up from the bottom of the sea

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And shouted praises

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was an amazing scene

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And this is what was completed

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's Nittere-chan

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Isomata will be back soon

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He was kicked out

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yoshimoto's company is in Osaka

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wait a minute

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You talked to me

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Talk to me

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's do it at the end

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's do it

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you doing?

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It hasn't started yet

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't get angry

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't get angry

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yamazaki

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Stop it

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stop hitting each other

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yamazaki, stop it

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're good at it

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I like it

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop fighting

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Stop it

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Stop it

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Who are you?

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Listen to your opinion

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Listen to your opinion

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Stop it

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Stop it

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You guys are ***

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
***

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It doesn't matter

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It doesn't matter

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It doesn't matter

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You guys

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If I do it, you can't do it

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Isomata can accept it

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't accept it

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's an order

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's an order

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a company

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a company

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a company

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a company

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a company

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a company

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's not

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okamoto-san has been in many movies

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know if there's a movie called Mataya

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know if there's a movie called Mataya

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't talk like that

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We're working

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I read the news every week

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I read the news every week

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I read the news

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
To be honest

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I always say, I'm tired of Okamoto-san

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I always say, I'm tired of Okamoto-san

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I always say, I'm tired of Okamoto-san

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If I win the game

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If I win the game

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not to my liking

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's start

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm wearing this hat

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm wearing this hat

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm fighting

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Apparently it's going to sell

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not going to sell

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's 4800 Yen

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's 4800 Yen

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's expensive!

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But you can buy it for 2,000 yen

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, you can buy it for 2,000 yen

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think people around the world would want it

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry but I'm going to wear it

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's good

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is that good, everyone?

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to play 3 games

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Please tell us

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
First, the first game

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Cool!

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wow!

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're really good

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As you can see

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The cat is the same

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The cat is cool

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What is this?

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Start!

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It started

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What is that sword?

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What is that sword?

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is that sword?

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm just stretching

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Get down!

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Get down!

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
One, two, fight!

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's amazing

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not working at all

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing?

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I thought you were going to attack continuously

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What is this?

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What is this?

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Get back!

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Get back!

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Get back!

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What is this?

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Get back!

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're still standing?

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's good

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're still standing?

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This was the ideal situation

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What is this program?

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You lied!

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was listening

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What is this program?

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll do it

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you stop now, it will be Isomata

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll do this

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is this?

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll hit you

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll hit you

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Stop it

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Shut up

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're the worst

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You have a great body

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Your upper body

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's okay, you can win

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Binta no Binoji wa Big no Bi

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Aiue Okamoto vs Babi Bube Binta Taiketsu

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Binta no Binoji wa Big no Bi

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Aiue Okamoto vs Babi Bube Binta Taiketsu

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That was fast

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Defend

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Good

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That was painful

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What was that?

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What was that?

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What was that?

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What was that?

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It hurts

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can't do that

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That was good

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What is this program?

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How should we judge this?

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How should we judge this?

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I won

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I lost

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you looking at?

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Look at it

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll look at it

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can do it again

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why do you have to do it again?

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's hard to understand

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Do it again

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Binta Taiketsu

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That was good

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's the end

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Binta Taiketsu

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's the end

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okamoto

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll give this hat to Isomata

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What are you looking at?

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What are you looking at?

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What are you looking at?

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's not working

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Which one did you like?

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What are you laughing at?

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You liked it?

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okamoto liked it

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's right

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We didn't see it like that

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a fighting game

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a variety

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There's no picture

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There's no picture

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We took it in Japan

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If you don't take it in Japan

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If you don't take it in Japan

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's a loss

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you think?

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Aosu's picture is cool

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's cool

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's cool

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The last one

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yoshimoto Meibutsu Mogitate Pants Mogitori Taiketsu

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yoshimoto Meibutsu Mogitate Pants Mogitori Taiketsu

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The total of the 3

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Which one was the best?

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's what it means

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's changing

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's changing

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's what it means

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's no choice

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have to look at the total

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I see

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Fight

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ok

251
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's different from before

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you have stamina?

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Do you have stamina?

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's using his legs

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's good

256
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Ok

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Shake it

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Shake it

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh no

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh no

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh no

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What do you want to do?

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What do you want to do?

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is there such a thing?

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is there such a thing?

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's getting more and more

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ok

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Ok

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't need a manager like this

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Ok

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sorry

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Sorry

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Sorry

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Ok

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Ok

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Rest

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't sleep

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I did it a little bit more.

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hey, you look like Bulma.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okamoto.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There is no winner in this game.

283
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm a loser when I'm playing.

284
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're so stupid.

285
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What is this show?

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm still in the pot.

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This year, there will be 20 people like this in Yoshimoto Kogyo.

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There will be 2 people like this.

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There will be 2 people like this.

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Just now, I was saved by Gong.

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's do our best.

292
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Fight!

293
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What's wrong?

294
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What's wrong?

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What's wrong?

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You look like a salmon.

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What are you doing?

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I see.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I see.

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is not good.

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is not good.

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This is not good.

303
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is embarrassing.

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is embarrassing.

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is embarrassing.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Break time.

307
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was saved by Gong.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's OK.

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's OK.

310
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Fight!

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Fight!

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You look like Kamikaze.

313
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You look like Koumon Marumi.

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You're too low.

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're too low.

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okamoto-san, you look like...

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Winner!

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This hat goes to Isomata.

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you.

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you.

321
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you.

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Isomata is OK, right?

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Isomata, the manager who defeated Okamoto, will he be able to film safely?

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What is this behind you?

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okamoto-san.

327
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I thought it was a joke.

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's cool.

329
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You wanted to do it like this.

330
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's because you want to win.

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I see.

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But it's OK.

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll do it.

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why?

335
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sweating.

336
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's not like that.

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's not like you're sweating.

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What did you do until now?

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm exhausted.

340
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're sweating, so you're the one who's exhausted.

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't say things like a quiz.

342
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No.

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're the one who's excited.

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, well, but...

345
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You all agree with what I'm doing, right?

346
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What do you mean by everyone?

347
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The people who are watching, the people who are here, the camera-san, the lighting-san, everyone.

348
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The people who are watching, the people who are here, the camera-san, the lighting-san, everyone.

349
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's a great opinion.

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't want to do it.

351
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's OK.

352
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll do it.

353
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I did my best.

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I did my best, but in the end...

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll do it.

356
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll show you that kind of look.

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's the time when you shouldn't show it the most.

358
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes, yes.

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Since you've said it so far, I'll do it.

360
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right.

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The set is ready.

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's already prepared.

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What was it like?

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's right.

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It was like this.

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You too, Nittere-chan.

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right?

368
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's cool.

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But can you show us the one until now?

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's a location, right?

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The glass shoes are Nittere-chan.

373
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The program name is Nittere-chan.

374
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Nittere-chan.

375
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's like this until now.

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's not that big.

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You made a set like this.

378
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's right.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not that big.

380
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It wasn't that much of a fight until the end.

381
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's 3 seconds.

382
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
3 seconds, 3 seconds.

383
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It seems to be 3 seconds.

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You have to say the line within 3 seconds.

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
In one shot.

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What should I do?

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The servant of the kid is Nittere-chan.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You don't need the servant of the kid.

389
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What?

390
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You said it in the program.

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You don't need the servant of the kid.

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What kind of comment is that?

393
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Nittere-chan is Okamoto-chan.

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Nittere-chan is Okamoto-chan.

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's not Nittere-chan.

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Nittere-chan is Okamoto-chan.

397
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's right.

398
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If you still say Okamoto-chan is Nittere-chan.

399
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You'll know it again.

400
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Nittere-chan is Okamoto-chan.

401
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What?

402
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not the part where you get caught.

403
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's huge.

404
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So it's equal.

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Nittere-chan was absorbed.

406
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's right.

407
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I got it.

408
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You can say that.

409
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What was that again?

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What was it again?

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Nittere-chan's red tea

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Nittere-chan's red tea

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're funny

414
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Why did you do that?

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What happens when it's 9?

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's too late!

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's already 3 seconds

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're drinking it now

419
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's not like that

420
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's the shop of the doctor at the university hospital

421
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yamazaki, can you run away? It's only 3 seconds

422
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm fine

423
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Really?

424
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I've prepared a set

425
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You don't have to do that

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This guy...

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I hate him

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why do you have to do that?

429
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think so

430
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's go

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's go

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Ready

433
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ready

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's strange

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have a different face

437
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's because of the atmosphere

438
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The atmosphere here

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're making a role

440
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Can you do a cheerful pose?

441
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll do that

442
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ready

443
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ready

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't stand up

446
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
His hand is cut off

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The frame is like this

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you stupid?

449
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's with the cheerful pose?

450
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You can't do that

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's go

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Ready

453
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Ready

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

455
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Cut

456
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is it okay?

457
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait

458
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You can't do that

459
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't like it

460
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You look fine

461
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I want to look more flashy

463
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What do you want to do?

464
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why are you doing that?

465
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I like to drink

466
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You can't do that

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's cold

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You should make a character

470
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Like an impersonator

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
An impersonator?

472
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You can't do that

473
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you want to try?

474
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Ready

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Action

476
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

478
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Okay

480
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you

481
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm not satisfied

482
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Who did that?

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Tamura Masakazu

484
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I knew it

485
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you want to try again?

486
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Again?

487
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Ready

488
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Action

489
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Nittere-chan, Okamoto-chan

490
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's good

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's good

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's go

494
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not good

495
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not good

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's not good

497
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's not good

498
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's okay

499
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll do it again

500
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll do a bigger one

501
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Let's do it

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Get ready

503
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Get ready

504
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I have another one

505
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He wanted to do that

506
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okamoto-san

507
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You did it

508
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Isomata did it better

509
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What are you talking about?

510
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What did you see?

511
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I did my best

512
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Isomata did it

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No

515
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You'll see

516
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Ready

517
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Action

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's

519
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Wow

520
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Thank you

522
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It was good

524
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It was great

525
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It was okay in many ways

526
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It was okay

527
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's

528
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's from before

529
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's old

530
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You can do it

531
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's do it again

532
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's okay

533
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Let's do it again

534
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's do it again

535
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Thank you for watching
