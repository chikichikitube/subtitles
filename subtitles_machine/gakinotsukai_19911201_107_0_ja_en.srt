1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The second round!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Round 2!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Sit-ups!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wow, that looks hard.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's bad, right?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on, Norias!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Alright!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your hips are weird.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alright!

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is...

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Watch out!

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Watch out!

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is...

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Watch out!

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey!

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Watch this!

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Look!

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My Norias stopped him!

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You!

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You stopped him later!

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Alright!

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on, Yamagaki!

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alright!

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yamagaki, are you going to do this with your hands?

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or with your head?

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to do it with my head.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright!

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wow!

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wow!

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Norias!

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's do it again!

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please do it for me!

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright!

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I did it!

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wait, my Yamagaki

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is going to do this.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Really?

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's so annoying!

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This size!

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No!

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What are you doing?

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are you doing?

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The second round!

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's the second round?

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Look at this.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The table is prepared.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And the food.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In that sense,

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
my Norias

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is going to

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
put inago

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
on top of the food!

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Alright!

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Norias, go!

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Alright!

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look at this.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's eating

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the inago

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
like it's pickled.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's eating

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the inago

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
like it's pickled.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wow!

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yamagaki

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is going to

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
put inago

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
on top of the food!

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Cameraman,

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
put inago on top of the food!

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Zoom in!

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wow!

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's hard!

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Did you put inago

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
on top of the food?

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's hard!

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to grab

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the inago

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and eat it.

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you shaking?

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It hurts!

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't put it in your mouth.

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Zoom in!

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's really cold today.

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Right?

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
put inago

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
on top of the food!

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't hear you!

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't hear you!

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Alright!

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not cold at all!

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not cold at all!

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh no!

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh no!

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh no!

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
First,

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yamagaki's going to take off his pants.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
First,

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
over here!

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Zoom in!

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's going to do that too!

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then...

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go!

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Water!

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't look at me!

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't look at me!

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And the last one is...

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A firework!

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay!

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A firework!

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A firework!

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's beautiful!

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's beautiful, Norias!

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The winner of the 2nd prize is...

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Kikouchi Yamazaki!

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I challenge you to 3 challenges!

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What?

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on, Yamazaki!

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Switch on!

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's hot!

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's hot!

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you doing?

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't open it! It's really scary!

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's really scary!

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm waiting for you in front of the otakus!

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm waiting for you in front of the otakus!

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hello!

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What a beautiful hall!

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's really amazing!

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's going to take a while to get here

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's going to take a while to get here?

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's so dark!

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's like a Taj Mahal!

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm looking forward to the night

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Night like this?

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's really hard now

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have to work every day

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I have to work every day

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have a lot of work to do

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have a lot of work to do

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I have a lot of work to do

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm from Edo

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But we have to do our best.

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We have to do our best.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We don't know if we will be reborn as human beings.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We have to do our best as human beings.

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that so?

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If we are reborn as human beings, we won't even know if we are dumplings.

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why do we have to be reborn as human beings if we have a soul?

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What is that?

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it the end?

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do we have to wait until we are reborn as human beings?

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's a great thing.

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What are you talking about?

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are the one who is saying that.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why do we have to be dumplings?

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There is no dumpling.

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's obvious.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You can't move.

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If we are reborn as human beings, we can't bend the QB-3 doll.

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can't move the QB-3 doll.

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The QB-3 doll is just a habit.

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That is a real doll.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is a habit?

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If we are reborn as human beings, what is the lowest rank?

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It doesn't matter.

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is a habit the lowest rank?

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's absolutely wrong.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's true that dumplings are the lowest rank.

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can't say that dumplings are the lowest rank.

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What is lower than dumplings?

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Water dumplings.

179
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We don't know if we are reborn as human beings.

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's why we are saying that we have to do our best.

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If we are reborn as human beings, we are reborn as human beings.

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And there are many other human beings.

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Look at you.

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your sweat is shining.

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are a masterpiece.

187
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why are you suddenly singing a song?

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
A volleyball player.

189
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A Japanese player.

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He is 2.8 meters tall.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, no, no.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He is 2.8 meters tall.

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If he is 3 meters taller, he is 5.8 meters tall.

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's just the way he is.

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I wanted to say how tall he is.

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't know.

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But he is not ugly.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If we are reborn as human beings, we are reborn as human beings.

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He is a manly deer.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Or a goat.

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He is a manly deer.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He is a manly deer.

203
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Shut up.

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey.

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He is a manly deer.

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But he is only known as a zookeeper.

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He has a great moustache.

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He is wearing a pendant.

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why?

210
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Because he is so cool.

211
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He is amazing.

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't think that pose is cool.

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't think this pose is cool.

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He is a manly deer.

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Other manly deers are like this.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But he is like this.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
His hair is like this.

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
His hair is like a panther.

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
His hair is like a velvet.

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He is so cool.

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey.

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I will give this to you.

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You don't know how cool he is.

224
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's why.

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You don't know how cool he is.

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's why.

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't know how cool he is.

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He is a manly deer.

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He is amazing.

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You don't know how cool he is.

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You don't know how cool he is.

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He is so cool.

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You don't know how cool he is.

234
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You don't know how cool he is.

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
His body is complicated.

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But it is simple.

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He is flying high.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He changed the rules.

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He won when he saw another man's coat.

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He won when he saw another man's coat.

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What's that?

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Is that a sport?

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No, it's that kind of sport.

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like this?

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What are you looking at?

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm looking at the court.

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's so fun about it?

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's not like I did it.

249
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not saying it's fun.

250
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If it wasn't fun, you wouldn't be able to do it.

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you do that kind of sport,

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
if you don't stretch your back, your neck will definitely stretch.

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If it's that kind of sport.

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you say it normally.

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll watch it today.

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Everyone does it to watch it.

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What do you think?

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll watch it.

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Everyone does it.

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll say, I watched it!

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll say, I watched it!

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Is it really a sport?

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't hate it.

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Golf?

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I haven't played golf recently.

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Golf...

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't like it at all.

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What don't you like?

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Golf...

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why are you so...

271
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You don't like it?

272
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The word golf...

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You say it like that.

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Go.

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wake up at 5.

276
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Wake up at 5.

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Order a Luzban.

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Order a Luzban.

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Flamenco.

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What kind of sport do you hate?

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've never skied.

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Ski?

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
S...

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
S...

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Like this.

286
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ki...

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ki...

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Like this.

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Ki...

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ki...

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like this.

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ki...

293
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ki...

294
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't like sports?

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What is the most profitable sport?

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Baseball.

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Baseball is not profitable.

298
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Baseball...

299
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Baseball...

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Baseball...

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Baseball...

302
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Baseball...

303
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Baseball.

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Baseball...

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Baseball.

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Baseball.

307
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Baseball.

308
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can be a professional footballer, but not yet.

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What do you mean?

310
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're still a non-professional, right?

311
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll be a professional footballer, like you.

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll be a professional soccer player.

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you want me to join?

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm good at soccer.

315
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Really?

316
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I didn't know that.

317
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm good at it.

318
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't drop the ball.

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I can play the ball for a long time.

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I can play the ball for a long time.

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can play the ball for a long time.

322
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can play with my leg.

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can play with my leg.

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
As you all know, I can also tap.

325
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
As you all know, I can also tap.

326
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can tap very quickly.

327
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll try it.

328
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you know?

329
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know.

330
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
See, I told you.

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In the meantime, I'll go look for the ball.

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Go look for it.

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Go look for it.

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll do the tap.

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll do the tap.

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll do the tap.

337
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Please listen to my strange mother.

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
My mother puts strange things in her bento.

339
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's strange.

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a bit strange here.

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The other day, I put in an anman.

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The other day, I put in a yokan.

343
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And when I asked why you put in a yokan,

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you said it was a potato yokan, so it's fine, right?

345
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It has potatoes in it.

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I see.

347
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You don't have to be so mean.

348
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Have you ever put in strange things in your bento?

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is...

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Generally, the most common thing is putting in something like beans.

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you talking about?

352
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What do you call that?

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What kind of beans are you talking about?

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you talking about the sweet ones?

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's also a bit harsh, right?

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There are also the black ones.

357
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The black ones that are in the osechi dish.

358
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's also a bit harsh, right?

359
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You got angry when you got home, didn't you?

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What are you thinking?

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When I came home,

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
my stomach was full.

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You shouldn't say that.

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You should say,

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Welcome home!

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Shut up!

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's like something that Okan developed by himself.

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
My Okan is curry bean sprouts.

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He put curry in the bean sprouts.

370
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I hate that kind of beans!

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I really want you to stop doing that.

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But there are also the ones that even have fruits in them.

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You put them in the bean sprouts.

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The ones that even have fruits in them are very...

375
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They're very high-grade.

376
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They're like a lady.

377
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You put them in the bento box and they have fruits in them?

378
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's right.

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I also put them in sometimes.

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I told you.

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I told you.

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The next day, I put in strawberries.

383
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't get used to that.

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm an amateur.

385
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I put them in the rice bowl of a normal bento box.

386
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have that.

387
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I put them in rice bowls.

388
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I have that.

389
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I put them in the rice bowls.

390
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I can't get used to that.

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I put them in the rice bowls.

392
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Shut up!

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I see.

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You know what level they're at in the broadcasting industry?

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What?

396
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What do you mean?

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
My house is like a newsroom.

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But the newspaper...

399
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There's a bento box and the newspaper is there, right?

400
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah.

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They were serving rice balls like this to the newspaper.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Where was that guy?

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Morioka Yonekino, right?

404
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He was poor.

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was pretty bad, but he was poor.

406
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Especially when we went on a trip, he was like that.

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It was even more shocking.

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Morioka's Myoga bento.

409
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What was that?

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm hungry, Morioka.

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's eat bento.

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Leave me alone for a moment.

413
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Why? Why?

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
When I went to see it, there were a lot of white rice balls.

415
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's right, that's right.

416
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
With myoga.

417
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's tough.

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's crunchy, crunchy, crunchy.

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Next.

420
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I have a question for Matsuyo.

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
When you're lost or in trouble, you say, tentekomai.

422
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What kind of dance is this?

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let's have him dance.

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you need a hand?

425
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, I don't need it.

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You don't need it?

427
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

428
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then, please dance.

429
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes.

430
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Then, Mr. Matsumoto.

431
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Do you need a hand?

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Hey, you.

433
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you need a woman to bathe you?

434
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Now, everyone.

435
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's have Mr. Matsumoto dance in front of everyone.

436
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's tentekomai.

437
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's tentekomai.

438
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's it.

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like this, sometimes.

440
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

441
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is it OK?

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes.

443
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There are a lot of terms.

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You say to bathe a woman, right?

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes, you say to do it.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You say to write it.

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I wrote yesterday that I bathed.

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That means you did.

449
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You say I had sex.

450
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm his mother.

451
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't keep up with Tom, Gyo, Kai, Yoko, etc.

452
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Tokyo is amazing.

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Right?

454
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Especially the people here.

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Especially the staff here. I can't believe it.

456
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Especially Saito.

457
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Saito?

458
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll give him a name.

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Parma No. 2.

460
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Saito is terrible.

461
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Saito is amazing.

462
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What did you say today?

463
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well...

464
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What did you say?

465
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That shop has good atmosphere.

466
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you know what I mean?

467
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It has good atmosphere. Do you know what I mean?

468
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That shop has good atmosphere.

469
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It has good atmosphere.

470
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What do you mean by atmosphere?

471
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why did you turn it upside down?

472
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I told you to say Roppongi.

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I said Giroppon yesterday.

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Say Roppongi.

475
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's Giroppon?

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why did you turn it upside down?

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Motoichi.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll give you a good name.

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Say it.

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Say it.

481
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll give you a good name.

482
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Then, shall we go home?

483
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, the ball is here.

484
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
My staff is excellent.

485
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh, no.

486
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why?

487
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's rubber.

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It has nothing to do with it.

489
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The official ball is made of leather.

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a soccer ball.

491
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It has nothing to do with rubber and leather.

492
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It has nothing to do with it.

493
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hey, you.

494
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Show me what a real person is.

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Who is that?

496
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You.

497
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm a real person.

498
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Show me what a real person is.

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Where should I do it?

500
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Here? Or here?

501
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know.

502
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You can do it here.

503
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Or here.

504
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Or here.

505
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You should start with your knees.

506
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
With my knees?

507
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Here.

508
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, my head is stuck.

509
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Do it.

510
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's enough.

511
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why do I have to do this every time?

512
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Come on.

513
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let's do it.

514
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
One.

515
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Two.

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Three.

517
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's the best.

518
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hurry up.

519
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I've already done it.

520
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Keep doing it.

521
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
How many seconds is the end roll?

522
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
30 seconds.

523
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's the worst.

524
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's not enough.
