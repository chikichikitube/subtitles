Azazaki is here in the rain

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You are so humble

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you going to eat?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I will throw this ball

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will throw this ball

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Matsumoto will hit it

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will catch the ball

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's easy

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you make a mistake, you lose

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you make a mistake, you lose

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will give you 1000 yen each

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will give you a charity

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am serious

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We are warriors

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000

Azazaki, you look like a poor guy

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You look like a rich guy

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He must have poop on his pants

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000

Is this possible?

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,000

I can't do it

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Are you out of your mind?

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why did you shoot the speedball?

It's good

93

Porsche 911 Carrera

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Is it a new car?

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a new car

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Gasoline

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a set

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's do our best

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Go

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Porsche 911 Carrera

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is this?

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's weird

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Stop it

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I thought it would float

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not angry

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It doesn't float

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I understand

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not funny

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
One more time

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop it

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I forgot the bat

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The bat

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's angry

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He took the glove

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's the second time

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Which one was better?

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Mine was the first one

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did you really do it?

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's do it

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Porsche

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Porsche

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That was amazing

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was one step behind

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Damn it

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I can't help it

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't hit the ball

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I just hit it

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I did it

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's do it

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll use Porsche at my office

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll take care of you

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll take care of you

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's have fun this summer

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll take care of us

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm counting on you

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm counting on you

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why are you so happy?

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The audience is happy

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's not good

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll cut it

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm getting older

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why are you so old?

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm serious

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're cool

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're a man

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I like Japan

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm serious

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm getting older

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I used to drive a white car

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was raining

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was excited

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It was about 100 meters

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I wanted to think about it

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I wanted to take it easy

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I got off the car and ran

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you think I can do it?

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't think I can do it

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I heard later that there was an explosion in the car

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
As soon as I ran, I got a backache

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't run

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I want to run

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My body can't keep up

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But if I stop, I'll break it

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My back hurts

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I ran like this

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I got a lucky punch

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a strange way of running

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But it's dangerous

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can't do this

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been saying that for a long time

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't think I can do it

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please think about it

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let me do it

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't think I can do it

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm serious

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Really?

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Was it hard today?

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Today's baseball

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It was hard

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was born to play baseball

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
My body

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Everyone is

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
saying that my body is amazing

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is it amazing?

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I've been doing the same thing

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I've been doing the same thing

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've been doing it since I was in Japan

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is it amazing?

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't like baseball

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm not interested

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm more amazing

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How amazing?

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How amazing?

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Tornado-like

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Tornado-like?

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's just you

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm more amazing

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You are

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Tornado is amazing?

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's my tornado

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What kind of tornado?

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What kind of tornado?

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Like this

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Old man

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Old man

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Why are you acting like an old man?

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I do it like this

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Then?

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Normally you do it like this

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Normally

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I do it like this

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I do it like this

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's a stick

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You have to show me your tornado

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't do my tornado

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Like this

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's a tornado

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What kind of tornado is yours?

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
My tornado is like this

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Like this

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right?

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Here you go

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't ask me

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My tornado is like this

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Your tornado

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
My tornado is like this

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't ask me

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Everyone knows my tornado

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Your tornado

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
My tornado

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Show me your tornado

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't have a tornado

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You have one

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have a tornado

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What is that?

253
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What is that?

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's your tornado

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
My tornado

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Here I go

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's normal

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You threw it normally

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I didn't throw it normally

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I just threw it and it became like this

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
My tornado is

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
My feeling

264
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You have a lot of feelings

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You have a lot of feelings

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You have a lot of feelings

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't have a feeling

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Everyone can't tell

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's a tornado

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't have a feeling

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Show me your tornado

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't have a feeling

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Everyone knows

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I told you to throw your tornado

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why did you throw my tornado?

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You said it's different from your tornado

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's your tornado

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's your tornado

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's not time for me to think

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not time for me to think

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
While I was doing my tornado

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was thinking about my tornado

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I was thinking about my tornado

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you stupid?

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You are my tornado

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You can do it right away

287
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can do it right away

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Have you seen my tornado?

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you my enemy?

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you my enemy?

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You have to support me

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So that I can laugh

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't interfere

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's why

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm working

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Look at Nomu's tornado

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Look at Nomu's tornado 4 or 5 times

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why?

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why?

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's okay

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do it

302
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Do it

303
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's sudden

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's sudden

305
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's okay

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Wait

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't like him

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's okay

310
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's okay

311
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's okay

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's okay

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's okay

314
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's different from your tornado

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's different

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Everyone is like that

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Me too

318
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This person too

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They are different

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
They are great

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You are the best

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't laugh

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't be friends

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's a friend

326
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Who is this?

328
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Please try

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please try

330
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Summer is the season of conversation.

331
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who is also a spiritist, what was the most amazing spirit you've ever fought?

333
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're a spiritist, aren't you?

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I can feel your spirit.

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm not a spiritist.

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, you're a spiritist.

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why were you so strict?

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You see, I...

339
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you trying to be serious?

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I have a phone number at various places.

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Are you going to pay me?

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes, yes, yes.

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Really?

344
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, I'm not going.

345
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Because you can't?

346
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No, because I'm busy.

347
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because you can't?

348
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No, I've been busy lately.

349
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What have you been doing lately?

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
In the past, I went to places where I was told to go.

351
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So what kind of things are you going to pay?

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm a bad spirit.

353
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, well, I'll give you an example of a house in the pond.

354
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What was it like in the past?

355
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That was when I went to Gunma Prefecture, wasn't it?

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes.

357
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yes.

358
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The children were very mischievous.

359
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I was hungry.

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, well, that's why I solved it right away.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Look at it.

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I wrote it because I thought it was different.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Be careful.

364
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Parents are bad.

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Please rap for each other.

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't do it.

367
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Do it.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I can't do it.

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You really can't do anything.

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You don't have a sense of rhythm.

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Is that so?

373
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Please tell me.

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know if you're in the mood to sing.

376
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It would have been better if I hit it.

377
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't have this tempo anymore.

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hey, hey, hey, right?

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You remember it well.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Stand up.

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hand.

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Right?

383
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You too.

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't have a sense of rhythm.

385
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Do you have a lot of otaku?

386
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Of course I have.

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I have two rockabilly.

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Please tell me about the rockabilly.

389
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I can't do that much.

390
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Please tell me about the rockabilly.

391
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's like this.

392
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Basically.

393
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What basically?

394
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Rockabilly.

395
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Please tell me.

396
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Shall we go downtown?

397
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What?

398
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Shall we make the theme song of downtown rockabilly?

399
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, please.

400
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm getting tired of that.

401
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes.

402
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The theme song of downtown is the one you're doing now, right?

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

404
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That sound is like rockabilly.

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, that's fine.

406
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't care at all.

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Really?

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

409
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
By all means.

410
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Please.

411
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hamada and I are fans.

412
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What is it?

413
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What is it?

414
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Rockabilly.

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't be embarrassed.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm not embarrassed at all.

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Really?

418
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm a little embarrassed now.

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, really?

420
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If you're okay with it.

421
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm okay with it.

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Can I continue?

423
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't really want to see it.

424
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hamada and I are all night.

425
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
All night.

426
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Hamada and I are all night.

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a great lyrics.

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hamada and I are all night.

429
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm in it, too.

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Of course you are.

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You can still go at night.

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm not like that.

433
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hamada and I are all night.

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm not like that.

435
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm not like that.

436
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm not like that.

437
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I said I'm not like that.

438
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What?

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Who are you talking to?

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm not like that.

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hamada and I are all night.

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
All night?

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:21,000
All night?

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm scared.

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You have to study hard.

446
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What?

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What?

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Sing, sing.

449
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Hamada, you're funny.

450
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Next is the second one.

451
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's great.

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What are you going to do if you get married?

453
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's right.

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You have to do it once.

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You have to go back to the dressing room.

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If you go out, I'll design it.

457
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

458
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Clothes, clothes.

459
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, it's okay.

460
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'll make it with wood.

461
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
With wood?

462
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why wood?

463
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Wood is warmer.

464
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's true in Japan.

465
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I can't do that.

466
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll make it with wood.

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's like a guy in a suit.

468
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Wood, wood, wood.

469
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If that's the case,

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll make it with wood.

471
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You have to do it.

472
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Why do you have to do it with NHK?

473
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's embarrassing.

474
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Who's going to talk?

475
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What?

476
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Who's going to talk?

477
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Your wife will be happy.

478
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Your wife will be happy?

479
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You're a fool.

480
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What is that?

481
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's weird.

482
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's weird.

483
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's a white group, so it's weird.

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's weird if it's a red group.

485
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's weird if it's a red group.

486
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's weird if it's a white group.

487
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But it's a wood group.

488
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's weird.

489
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's weird.

490
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Even if it's a group, why won't it come out?

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I won't put it out.

492
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
No, no, no, no, no.

493
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're a little too much.

494
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
When I say, hey, hey, hey,

495
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's like a pop.

496
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You're a fool.

497
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You're a fool.

498
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Make it right.

499
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You're a fool.
