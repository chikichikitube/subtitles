1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the third episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Tsukitsuki Oogiri University!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is Mr. Tan's hammer.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, in front of everyone, Oogiri!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's hear how everyone is doing!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Everyone, please come out!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's introduce ourselves.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
First, please come this way.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The other day, when I went home,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
there was a beautiful woman near my house,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so when I approached her,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
she was my male friend.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She was beautiful.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Next to Jimmy-san,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm also a little shy.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Team Zero's Noriyasu.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In addition to the nightlife of Downtown Matsumoto-san,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I also have a problem with my handwriting.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It must be difficult for us to study together.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My name is Hamada-san.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My name is Funanori.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What is your heart?

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There is a woman in the port.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You guys have too many dirty jokes.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I have a bad image.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't be on the air.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll tell you a mystery.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My name is...

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My name is...

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Say your name!

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm surprised!

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm Downtown Matsumoto.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nice to meet you!

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Next, our young man.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've been a little red lately.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm Akamaru Kyoya.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First of all,

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Tokyo-zen Murimondo!

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Two of you,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
please talk to each other in Tokyo-zen.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Team Zero's Yamazaki and Noriyasu,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
let's go to Tokyo-zen Murimondo!

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you!

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Speak!

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Set 3!

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right!

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Your eyes are beautiful!

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is that?

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Isn't it Tokyo-zen?

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tokyo-zen!

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Your eyes are beautiful!

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your clothes are blue!

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
As you can see!

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Otomo-kun is from here.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Me and Osaka-ben Murimondo.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
May I?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We met in Osaka.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We were classmates.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're childhood friends.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I see.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go!

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Long time no see!

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Long time no see!

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How are you?

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm fine.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're still young.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How are you?

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't have much time.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's bad luck.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop it!

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's bad luck!

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okamoto-kun and Matsumoto-kun, let's go to Tokyo-zen Murimondo again!

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm screwed!

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Say it again!

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm screwed!

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We're going to talk about being screwed.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm screwed!

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm screwed!

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What?

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Huh?

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's because of that.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Stop talking!

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's fight.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's fight.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That was close!

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What?

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What?

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Who are you talking to?

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who are you talking to?

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's fine.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's over.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Finally, let's have a party!

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Finally, let's have a party!

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Today, we have some stuff from the convenience store.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's have them sing a song!

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go!

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Matsumoto-kun!

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's go!

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yamazaki-kun!

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go!

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go!

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go!

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go!

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's go!

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go!

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go!

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's start with Onigiri.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Onigiri song.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Onigiri and Onigiri.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Matsumoto!

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Matsumoto-kun!

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Matsumoto-kun!

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Matsumoto-kun!

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Matsumoto-kun!

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Matsumoto-kun!

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Matsumoto-kun!

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Matsumoto-kun!

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Matsumoto-kun!

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Matsumoto-kun!

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Matsumoto-kun!

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Matsumoto-kun!

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Matsumoto-kun!

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Matsumoto-kun!

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Last one!

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Matsumoto-kun!

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's been a while.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, well.

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We're in the rainy season.

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, well.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I hope it ends soon.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is that so?

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm a little nervous.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But you're under the blue sky.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Wow, Hanako-san!

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Who's Hanako-san?

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're not that kind of character.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not going to run like this because it's sunny.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not what I'm saying.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're not an outdoor person.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You used to surf like me.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't mess with me!

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What?

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I've been surfing for over 20 years, but this is the first time I've heard of it.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You used to surf?

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Of course.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I used to be a little like that.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I had a mushroom.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's true.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's true.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Nami is scary.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you make fun of Nami, it's true.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How many years have you been surfing?

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How many years?

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I've been surfing for about eight years.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Since when?

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Since I was about 13 years old.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What kind of experience have you had so far?

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Have you ever thought of dying?

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've never thought of dying.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I went to New Zealand.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I just heard that.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You went to New Zealand?

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
For a tournament?

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I didn't think I'd be surfing at that time.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When I was in junior high school.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I went to New Zealand.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It was a stormy night.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I visited my acquaintance's house.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You don't have any acquaintances in New Zealand?

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's your name?

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
MacGyar.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Steve from MacGyar.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know MacGyar.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who is Steve?

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He's my son.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
MacGyar's son.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How many?

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Four at that time.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you talk to each other?

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know four of them.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
My father used to...

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Look at my father.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He was a foreign exchange student.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And then...

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I used to run around in a tanker every day.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Your father was riding a tanker.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He had a high fever.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Who?

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Stephanie.

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Stevens.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There was no doctor in that town.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Far away.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Far away.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I had to go to the other island across the sea.

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You lived in a big place.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's right.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
MacGyar.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It was a big storm.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My son had a high fever at that time.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you going to do?

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't know what to do.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I got it.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I saw a wave.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What was that?

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Was that a wave?

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I saw a wave.

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I saw a board.

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
My brother, it's hot.

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
My body is hot.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's dangerous.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's dangerous?

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you leave it like this, it's dangerous.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's dangerous.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's dangerous.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to borrow it.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll borrow it.

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're a fool.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's true.

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It was good.

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're a man.

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Is that so?

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to watch this show in the summer.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I want to watch the opening of the show in August.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I want to watch it on the beach.

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What month is it now?

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's July.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's July.

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It will be a month later.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's right.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why are you saying that?

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Until then, I'll be a mushroom.

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you doing?

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you doing?

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Your head should be a mushroom.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, that's...

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You should prepare a mushroom.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The staff here are fools.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll do it for real.

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll do it for real.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I want to see it.

254
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Everyone was holding hands.

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Show it to me.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm looking forward to it.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's dangerous.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
When you light it up...

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's coming out, right?

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't know if I should say it in technical terms.

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Please say it.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There's a board, right?

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

264
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's coming out under the board.

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What is that?

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What is it?

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's coming out.

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is a wing.

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you call this a wing?

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's my group.

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's my NIAIYAGARA BOYS.

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's enough.

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
In general...

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What's NIAIYAGARA BOYS?

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is a group we make.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's that?

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's more.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You can't be so proud of yourself.

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There's nothing.

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You were born.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You need to challenge yourself.

282
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think so.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You do, right?

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm doing most sports.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm already doing it, and then, what is it, I also play the drums.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, I'm pretty good at it.

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When I'm frustrated, I go like this.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Where do you do it?

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Where do you do it?

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know, I don't know.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ah, I see.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, I'm already doing it.

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
How do you do it?

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, I go like this.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, I'm already doing it.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Ah, I see.

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, I can't say much about myself.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When I was doing a show before, everyone was playing the instruments.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You were playing the bass.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why did you tell me at that time that you couldn't do it?

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You were playing the castanets.

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You were playing the oboe.

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You were playing the chorus.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Everyone was doing their best.

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know why, but you were playing the udon next to me.

306
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You were playing the castanets like this.

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why didn't you do it at that time?

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well, I was at the bacon kitchen.

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's enough.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If you don't say that...

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, I got it.

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I got it, I got it.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I got it, I got it.

314
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There was a black person I was dating.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There was a black person.

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There was a black person.

317
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What's his name?

318
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What? You always want to know his name.

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No, I want to know his name.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It was a black person.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What's his name?

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, Zucchin.

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Zucchin.

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Zucchin.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You always say Zucchin.

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, yes.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a good match.

328
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a good match.

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's a good match.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's always a good match.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm thinking that he's on today.

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What kind of contest?

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Drum.

334
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Drum contest.

335
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I won't lose.

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You lost, didn't you?

337
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I was excited.

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But we were good friends.

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, really?

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But now, I don't have any new friends.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why were you so good friends with Zucchin?

342
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm dead.

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't cry.

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I was listening to the radio the other day.

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Makihara from Donna Tokimono said,

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I like you two from downtown.

347
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Do you two like Makihara?

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was there the other day.

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
At the home of the Tokimono family.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hama-chan.

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
In the back, there was a suit with buttons.

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Short pants.

353
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Round shoes.

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I put it on like this.

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's how it is.

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can't laugh.

357
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, it's been a long time.

358
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like this.

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Good morning.

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I've been doing this all the time.

361
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
How is it?

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What is it?

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Makihara-san.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't like him or hate him.

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Isn't it strange?

366
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I like him or hate him.

367
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Isn't it strange?

368
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Once, I was invited to the audition of Setouchi Shounen baseball team.

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's right.

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
With Toshichan.

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't call him Toshichan.

372
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Did you hear that?

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He called me Toshichan.

374
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's cool.

375
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He called me Toshichan.

376
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's right.

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm Sawara-san.

378
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes.

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Setouchi Shounen baseball team.

380
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There was another guy who was invited to the audition.

381
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It was decided more than 90% before the audition.

382
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
When I went to the other side, he said,

383
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's okay if you don't get drunk.

384
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I went to the other side.

385
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I was asked to read a book.

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
At the end, most of them said,

387
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Is that so?

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's great.

389
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You said it in front of him.

390
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's right.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hello.

392
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you for coming all the way from Osaka.

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Can I ask you one last question?

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What is it?

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You were sitting, right?

396
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why did you say,

397
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is it?

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What is that look?

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was sitting in this position.

400
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was about to go home.

401
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Can I ask you one last question?

402
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you like Tawara Toshiko?

403
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's right.

404
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't like her.

405
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's right.

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why do you like her so much?

407
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If I were a woman, I might think she's cool.

408
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But Tawara Toshiko is weird.

409
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't like her.

410
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Everyone was surprised.

411
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's why I didn't like her.

412
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's why I said I like Makihara.

413
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No matter how much they want to be hugged by me.

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can't hug him.

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I can't.

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why did you say that twice?

417
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well.

418
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's right.

419
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I think I've heard this before.

420
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why do you have hair here?

421
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was wondering if it was useful.

422
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
At that time, I thought,

423
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
People shouldn't hurt people.

424
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When we fight, when this hits,

425
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Instead of a cushion.

426
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Instead of a cushion.

427
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't be stupid.

428
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's no cushion.

429
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Even if you use a bow, you'll get hurt.

430
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's what you said.

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm a peacekeeper.

432
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't want to use this iron sword.

433
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What?

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't want to use this iron sword.

435
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't want to use it.

436
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When you say, don't hit here.

437
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If it comes out.

438
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What's the cushion?

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
In my case.

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What is it?

441
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What is it?

442
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Actually, that's why I killed Zucchini.

443
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Shut up!
