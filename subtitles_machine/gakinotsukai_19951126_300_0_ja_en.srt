1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is the second episode of Chikishiki!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's Producer Hichihenge!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Mr. Shikajima

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This old man really came out

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can't do anything about his energy

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yamazaki did it before

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He was pretty popular

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If it was him, it would be me

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's time

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
OK

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Last time, Yamazaki gave me 3,000 yen

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He gave you 10,000 yen in total

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yamazaki gave me 10,000 yen

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How much will you give me today?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm looking forward to it

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Burnt tennis ball

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What should we do?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sugachan, you drink too much

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's 300th anniversary, so I should drink

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's 300th anniversary

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It looks like you're in love

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I took a picture with you on the phone

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What is it?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You said you were a producer

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think so

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think so

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to hug you

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I want to hug you

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not good at hugging

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm tired

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I see

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll ask you

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What is it?

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're drinking with someone

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's strange to drink with such a combination

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's strange

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's better to drink like this

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a fun program

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why is he wearing a T-shirt?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's full of energy

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's full of energy

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's full of energy

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm full of energy

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm full of energy

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm full of energy

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm full of energy

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm full of energy

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm full of energy

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm full of energy

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm so hungry

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Who are you?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can't go back

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Nagasaki Tsurugi

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're finally here

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're here

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've been waiting for you

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was waiting for you

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hurry up and wash your ass

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was waiting for you

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't do this

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can't do this

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Put it in

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wow, that's amazing

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I just opened it with that momentum

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't try to hit me

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't do this

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you making that face?

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're making a sad face

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're making a sad face

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do it

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Did you decide?

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you decide?

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, not yet

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Speed it up

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Roger

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It seems that Z has appeared

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm protecting the earth rather than my job

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Excuse me

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What's that?

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's that?

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Z's that

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Z's that

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's that?

89
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What's that?

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Takaitoko version

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Takaitoko version

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's good

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Can you show us your spirit?

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Say something

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Look at the number

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
14,000

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Z's that is easy

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is it easy?

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was dancing after the trumpet

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Good evening

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sure you can see the difference between us

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What do you mean?

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
With them?

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No, you

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You and me

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why?

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
They are drunk

110
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Are you making up a story?

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't say that

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why are you angry?

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You look like you are going to eat something delicious

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All of it?

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You look like you are going to eat the bones

117
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can eat it

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is that so?

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Last week, the airing was like a horror movie

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It was

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I fell down

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It can't be helped

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's here this time

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you saying?

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's here

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
First of all, I was in a big trouble

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I was just in a big trouble

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It was just an electric shock

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When I was sleeping alone at home, I had a fever of 40 degrees

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You said you had a fever

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I had a fever

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Electric shock

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Of course, I was

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was living alone

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was living alone with a fever

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I saw you in the kitchen

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wait a little longer

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm making it now

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who is that?

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know

143
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's okay

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can only rely on Okamoto

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can only call Okamoto during the day

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I call Okamoto and ask him to take me to the hospital

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
While I was selling electric shock, the doctor called the manager

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You should have told me

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I was just selling electric shock

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't like it, but the manager

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you doing with the rice?

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm heating the rice

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you doing?

154
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm about to cry

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm serious

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm serious

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm serious

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What are you doing?

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm serious

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When I was sleeping alone, I had a fever of 40 degrees

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's right

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
When I looked at the thermography, it was red

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
From the top of the apartment to the thermograph

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What is this? It's red

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the boiler room

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What is this red thing?

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Sasaki-kun

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Who is that?

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Who are you calling?

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sasaki-kun

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Sasaki-kun

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What is this red thing?

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's red

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did you have a stomachache?

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I only poop

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I really poop

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You poop at that time

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's a long time

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I poop

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I poop once

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I poop because I poop too much

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I pooped a lot

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to take it with me

184
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't do it often

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Can I cut it?

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You can cut it

187
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I was hospitalized two weeks ago

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Really?

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You are cute

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can put it on later

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can do it from the beginning

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No, really

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can cut it and fix it

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You are a fool

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Even if you gather five people who are good at fighting, the weakest one will not come

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You were really good just now

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't know if I'm good or not

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you don't talk to me, I'm still on the way

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Can you see my underwear?

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Can you see it?

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If I fall down and come back, you will fall down

203
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I know

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I know why you are doing this

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What?

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You want to play with me, right?

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Everyone was saying, Matsumoto, Matsumoto

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Matsumoto, are you okay?

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What?

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have a new harm mind

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What is that?

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm a woman too

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If I come back, I will be like this

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What am I?

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I will be dark

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You have a bad personality

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm sorry

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you don't do your best, it will be the end of the year

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Who are you?

220
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, really

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't want to see your underwear

222
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't want to see my underwear

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And then, the season came little by little

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Right

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The season came

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This year, compared to the previous years, it's difficult

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You always say which one is red and which one is white

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Wait, I haven't decided yet

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I haven't been told anything

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You really want to come out

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Really

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I will come out

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because you are the only one who is not shy

235
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm not shy

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's not important

237
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's my job

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You are not red, you are white

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No matter where you look, I'm red

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm black

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
To be more specific, I'm black

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But

243
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Right

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm white

245
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Your hard work will guide you

246
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But to be honest

247
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know if I'm nervous

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What should I do with this face?

249
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please tell me

250
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
To be honest, that's what happened at the hit studio

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It was terrible

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
When I come out, you come with me

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
When I'm alone, you come with me

254
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I want to see your face when you come out

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I want to see your face when you smile

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I want to see your face when you come out

257
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's really funny

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can't come out

259
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But when you sing, you come out like this

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Like Sabu-chan

261
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Everyone can't come out

262
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Sabu-chan is like this

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What is this song?

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What is this song?

265
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What is this?

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What is this?

267
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What is this?

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What is this?

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What is this?

270
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll send you a letter

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This is a question for Matsumoto

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What is the maximum volume you need?

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Have you ever raised it to the maximum?

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I've raised it quite a bit

276
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But if it's too much, it'll be like this

277
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's not good

278
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's just noisy

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You have to overcome that

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You have to overcome that

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
How much volume do you usually watch on TV?

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
How do I explain it with my mouth?

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You can explain it with pineapple or fruit

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Explain it with pineapple

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know if everyone watches it with bananas, but it's hard to understand

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I can't explain it

287
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I watch it with 15

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It depends on the type

289
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The 15 next to it and the 15 next to it are completely different

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The 15 next to it is the same, so it's not a number

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If it's more than that, it's noisy

292
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If it's more than that, it's noisy

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But what about you?

294
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You don't understand it?

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If it's more than that, I can see a new discovery

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You can't see anything, it's just noisy

297
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
For example, you watch Nagisa Oshima on TV

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You watch Nagisa Oshima?

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You watch Nagisa Oshima on TV

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You watch the debate until morning

301
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If it's 15, you say, I'll do it

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Nagisa Oshima

303
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You say, I'll do it

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The volume is going up

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And you raise the volume

306
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Something amazing will happen

307
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What?

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What?

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You've done it so far

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What about Nagisa Oshima?

311
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You raised the volume

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nagisa Oshima

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You watch Nagisa Oshima on TV until morning

314
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's Nagisa Oshima

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Is it okay to talk about Nagisa Oshima now?

316
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's okay, anyone can do it

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If it's 15, you say, I'll do it

318
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If it's 15, you say, I'll do it

319
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Nagisa Oshima

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
If it's 25, you say, I'll do it

321
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If it's 35, you say, I'll do it

322
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If it's 35, you say, I'll do it

323
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You'll take it off

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You'll take it off

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Nagisa Oshima is like this

326
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You'll say, it's hot

327
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's why everyone knows I'm a celebrity

328
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Even women can do it

329
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If you raise it, you'll take it off

330
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Even Yasaki who is saying this now

331
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If you raise it while looking at the kid

332
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll take it off

333
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
No one raises it now, so I won't take it off

334
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
How do you spend your New Year's Day?

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm thinking of going somewhere

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Where are you going?

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm thinking of where I'm going

338
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't have money, so go

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Everyone is saying, let's go to Hawaii

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's not good

341
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What's not good?

342
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you go to Hawaii, you won't get a young woman

343
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No, Gyo-san is saying it

344
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Usually, you go on New Year's with your family

345
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's also the majority, but he's saying it

346
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hostesses and old men

347
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't know the details

348
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But he's saying it

349
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hostesses and ninjas

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hostesses and ninjas?

351
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's interesting

352
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Where are you going?

353
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Kyushu

354
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Old men?

355
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Why is Kyushu an old man?

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Kyushu

357
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I understand

358
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Kyushu

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Kyushu

360
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's a matter of how you say it

361
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I understand

362
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Maybe Kohaku is watching somewhere in Kyushu

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Kyushu?

364
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Don't think about it

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
No, no

366
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm not the one who's interesting

367
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm in Kyushu

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You're the only one who can walk like this

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
No, it's not like that

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm having fun in Kyushu

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Why are you eating sushi?

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Why are you eating sushi?

373
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No

374
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You're the only one eating sushi

375
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Eat at a better place

376
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Thank you

377
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What?

378
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
300 times

379
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I see

380
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Thank you

381
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Thank you

382
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
300 times

383
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Thank you

384
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You're the president

385
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm the president

386
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You're the president

387
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you

388
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Thank you

390
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Congratulations

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Thank you

392
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Congratulations

393
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No way

394
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Don't go home

395
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Did you come here for that?

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes, I did

397
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I definitely didn't come here for more than 300 times

398
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why did you lie?
