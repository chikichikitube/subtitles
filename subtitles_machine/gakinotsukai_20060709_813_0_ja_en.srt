1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first episode of the show, Hikari Umeda's Emergency! Tonight, you will witness the miracle of the thousand-year-old god!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good evening, I am the host, Shigeru Kajiwara.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And I have gathered everyone here today to witness the miracle.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,720
We are the downtown's children's

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Well, Mr. Hikateri Umeda, you have been the champion of fortune-telling, magic, and big-mouthed.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,720
You have been the champion of fortune-telling, magic, and big-mouthed.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,720
But, in fact, you were the man-biki-jimen of the great-master.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,720
This time, it became clear.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Man-biki is easier to catch than before.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,720
After five, even the boss who is busy and can't be caught at all can be caught easily.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,720
That's all.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,720
I don't know anything about him.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,720
I don't think he's from Canada.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
That's right.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,720
He's been called to Canada for an emergency.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Let's call him out.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
No blinkers while tracking.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
No eye ball fatigue.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
If you have a great skill, you'll be a G-man.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Hikari Ueda!

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,720
The world's most powerful man is 8.0.

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,720
He can be seen with the naked eye.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Next, the technique of the Kageyama Umeda will be exploded.

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,720
I found it.

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
He is the one.

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Please.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
The perfect shari is here.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,720
If you get a full-drawn, this one is low.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,720
It's a final line.

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Now, what is the situation of full-drawing in Japan?

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
I want you to see this graph.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Over 10,000 cases a week.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
This is the number of cases.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
By the way, by the way, by Mr. Piccadilly's coming next day,

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,720
How much will the number of full-drawing cases decrease?

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
This was expected by the experts.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
It will be like this.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
But...

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Heный...

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,520
It is a conjecture that almost all public complaints from Japan will disappear.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,280
Does that mean this is only linear?

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
That is a great thing.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,920
My sense of justice is not silly.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,540
Er?

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,560
My sense of justice is not over.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,160
Ah...

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,160
We have succeeded in filming a part of the scene of the work of Mr. Umeda Piccadilly.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
It looks like it's amazing.

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Let's take a look at the shocking video.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:17,500
ZOA and Ileva G-Men's

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
The attack of the two sides.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
A crime lurking nearby.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
The attack.

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Don't do it.

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
I did it.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
I just did it.

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Is this a disease that the modern society is suffering from?

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,160
A momentary malice.

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,160
But the price is too high.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I've seen this before.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Please help me!

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
I'll do something.

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,160
I'll use that footage.

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,160
The man is facing the crime that's repeated.

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Hey! Hey!

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Hey!

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
The dark is coming.

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
This is not the place.

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
This is not the place.

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,160
There is a supermarket in the neighborhood of Tokyo.

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,160
The total damage of this store is 1.5 million yen per year.

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,160
This man who received the SOS of such a store is the man who appeared.

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's go and feel it.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,160
There is always a blind spot in the supermarket.

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,160
That is the workplace for the manbikikan.

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Piccadilly is breaking down the workplace one by one.

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
But that is because his arm is called his arm.

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
That's great.

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:48,460
After a while, Piccadilly's sense of smell started to

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I'll do it like this.

81
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
I'll definitely do it.

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
The back of my head is going to be swollen.

83
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
The back of my head is going to be swollen.

84
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,460
The incident right after the earthquake.

85
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
It's a bomb. It's a bomb.

86
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,460
The night of the tsunami hit.

87
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,460
Certainly, the product disappeared in the woman's bag.

88
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,460
She doesn't even have time to take out the products from her bag.

89
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,460
And then the woman goes out of the store.

90
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,460
She is successful.

91
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Let's go.

92
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,460
Piccadilly follows the woman.

93
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Hey, Mr. Hoshiguma.

94
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
You are early.

95
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,460
You should have taken a bath.

96
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
What?

97
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,460
If you go there, you have to take off your clothes.

98
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,460
You have to take off your clothes.

99
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
The match was visible.

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
The woman, who was convinced by Piccadilly's words,

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
obediently agreed.

102
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
A wonderful fight.

103
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,460
Please put the things that ladies can't pass.

104
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,460
An unacceptable moment.

105
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,460
The stolen item came out of the bag.

106
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
That was the reality.

107
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,460
When she heard this, she was 48 years old, and the mother of two children.

108
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,460
I will teach you the tricks of the master's daughter.

109
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
Please forgive me.

110
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Please forgive me.

111
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Please forgive me.

112
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
Please forgive me.

113
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
Please forgive me.

114
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:36,460
The mother who doesn't want her family to know about her own sins, Piccadilly bites her.

115
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
Don't talk so much.

116
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,460
You don't know the difference between this and a handkerchief?

117
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,460
What would the child think if he knew this?

118
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,460
I'm too old to be here.

119
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm not coming back to this place.

120
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,460
You're coming back?

121
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
You're going home?

122
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Yes!

123
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
What's that?

124
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,460
The word of Piccadilly has fallen on her mother.

125
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,460
She wrote a promise that she would never do it again.

126
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,460
The woman has arrived at her home.

127
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,460
The manbiki g-men sometimes change their appearance and become normal.

128
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,460
The appearance of the woman who is patrolling the world is a familiar sight to anyone.

129
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Suddenly...

130
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
They are suspicious.

131
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Two girls are standing in front of the lady's eyes.

132
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
The bag is opening its mouth.

133
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Be careful!

134
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,460
And the next moment...

135
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
I put it in, I put it in, I put it in!

136
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,460
The girl's product in her right hand is in the bag.

137
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
It disappeared.

138
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Immediately, Piccadilly stands up to the girls.

139
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Hey, girls.

140
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,460
It's a security thing.

141
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,460
There is a new product, right?

142
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,560
Even if the bugs in the

143
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,460
bowl are deceived, my eyes are not deceived.

144
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,460
The girls who found out that they could not escape do not run away for some reason.

145
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:37,460
Even if caught, the girls who show a playful mischief are said to be 13 years old together.

146
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Did they intend to dress up as a thief?

147
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
That's not the problem!

148
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
You're not in the mood to do it!

149
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
I'm not going to reflect on myself at all!

150
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
What's so funny?

151
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,460
Is this game for the girls to enjoy the thrill?

152
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Piccadilly is not the type of person who would dry his tongue in this manner

153
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
Girls

154
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Here I come

155
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,460
I'll write a letter to you all

156
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,460
But I'm writing to all of you

157
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,460
Is it okay for me to take you all?

158
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
It's not going to be good

159
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,460
The sound of the girls' adoration for the adults disappeared when Piccadilly threatened them.

160
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,460
Hey!

161
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,460
And Piccadilly got the phone call.

162
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Hello?

163
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Hello?

164
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,460
I'm at the supermarket.

165
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
I caught two people with a slingshot.

166
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Please tell them to come over.

167
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,460
It's so delicious!

168
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
You're not eating it!

169
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,460
The end of the story was so bad that Piccadilly was in the modern society.

170
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
It's so good!

171
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,460
That was the moment when Piccadilly returned to heaven.

172
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
I'm scared!

173
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,460
That big guy is so annoying!

174
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:26,460
The foreign man that Piccadilly marked as 2 meters tall

175
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,460
The product is in his hands

176
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Immediately Piccadilly follows the foreign man

177
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,460
And he dives into the perfect position

178
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,460
It's always a scene that makes me feel sad

179
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Stop it!

180
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,460
We heard that, but the wish did not reach him.

181
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,460
He put it in.

182
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,460
The item disappeared into the hat of a foreigner.

183
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,460
It was a crime that took advantage of a large body.

184
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
There are many such things.

185
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Are you okay?

186
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Yo yo yo yo, my name is Piccadilly.

187
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,460
Piccadilly is a name that comes from Kanagajikomi.

188
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
Piccadilly!

189
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,460
Piccadilly's brilliant self-confidence.

190
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:37,460
I'm a man! I'm a man!

191
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,460
The men who heard the noise are holding the foreigners back.

192
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,460
I'm a police officer! I'm a police officer!

193
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,460
The three men are always in danger and side by side.

194
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,460
The story of Piccadilly's decision was a flash in the pan.

195
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,460
But after this, the greatest trial awaits Piccadilly.

196
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,460
How was it?

197
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:12,460
I want to know how Piccadilly became Manbiki G-man.

198
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
I want to know that.

199
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,460
Actually, Piccadilly himself was the head of Manbiki.

200
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Oh my!

201
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:29,460
So, he knows how much he should pull if he gets pulled.

202
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,460
Pulling hard.

203
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
Pulling hard?

204
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
He says pulling hard.

205
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Pulling hard.

206
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
You say pulling hard.

207
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Shut up!

208
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
You're too much.

209
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,460
You're too much.

210
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
It's because I'm stuck!

211
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm so mean!

212
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
We're going home.

213
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Wait, wait!

214
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Can we go home?

215
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,460
We can go home, we're not angry.

216
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
We can't go home.

217
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Sorry.

218
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
We're a little disappointed in the scene where you call out for a guy.

219
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,460
We happened to be out of the scene, so...

220
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,460
What do you do if he's not there?

221
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
We made him go home.

222
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Until you call me a man, that's the truth.

223
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
What?

224
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
What is it?

225
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
He's calling you a man.

226
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Until you call me a man, that's the truth.

227
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
He's a man.

228
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Hikarerii Jikiden

229
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,460
Let's reveal the truth.

230
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
As a 2 meter tall man,

231
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
as a man with a blind eye,

232
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
could you grab Hikarerii's chest?

233
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
I see.

234
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
Please.

235
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Oh!

236
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,460
I'm a man! I'm a man!

237
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,460
I'm a man!

238
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm a man!

239
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
That's enough.

240
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
I saw it on V.

241
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm a man!

242
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Mr. Kanegi, I understand.

243
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,460
We have just witnessed a miracle.

244
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:16,460
The one who is the most popular in the entertainment industry, the one who is said to be the most powerful, Yamazaki Hosei, has also been defeated in one moment.

245
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Day 2 of the infiltration.

246
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,460
The person who was entrusted to Piccadilly that day was the manbiki Joshu who has been running the store for many years.

247
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,460
I wonder if it's okay to take off my clothes this time.

248
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Let's go!

249
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,460
The reporter was surprised by Piccadilly's disguise.

250
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
What is this?

251
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,460
But that was the target.

252
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,460
He thought that a guy dressed like this wouldn't be able to win over 10,000 people.

253
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,460
It was a brilliant strategy that caught the opponent's attention.

254
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,460
It's crazy!

255
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
There's a limit to what you can do!

256
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,460
And finally, that time has come.

257
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
There she is! That woman!

258
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
This one?

259
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Don't get it wrong!

260
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,460
Our reporter also took a look at her.

261
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,460
She was a woman who was surprisingly beautiful.

262
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Certainly, the handbag is the same.

263
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
There is no doubt about the noise.

264
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Hikaderi takes a distance from the woman so that she is not noticed.

265
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
I was noticed...

266
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
What is this?

267
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,460
It was at that time.

268
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
I was noticed.

269
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
I was noticed.

270
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
I was noticed in front of Hikaderi.

271
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
I was able to say it well.

272
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm not going to do anything bad.

273
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
I'm not a woman.

274
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Will the woman leave the store without making any money?

275
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,460
Hurry up. Hurry up.

276
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Hurry up.

277
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Piccadilly is about to eat her.

278
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Hey, brother.

279
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,460
I have something I haven't finished yet.

280
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I didn't finish it just last night.

281
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
I made a mark on your back.

282
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I see.

283
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Then, shall we go?

284
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,460
It was a very bad situation.

285
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,460
The woman who was repeating the same thing for three months.

286
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,460
My life didn't go well at all.

287
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I was stressed out.

288
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
That's right.

289
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Okin.

291
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Yes?

292
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
You're not saying anything.

293
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,460
What?

294
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
I'm not saying anything.

295
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Then, I'll give you a massage.

296
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,460
That's not necessary.

297
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
I'll give you a big welcome in the future

298
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
You're so silly

299
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,460
The husband who received the call comes running

300
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,460
I'm sorry

301
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
I'm sorry

302
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,460
The woman who kept her head down in the wife's mistake

303
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
Proved the bond between the couple

304
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
I'm sorry

305
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Master

306
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:41,460
If you don't do it everyday, you'll get weak.

307
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Do you understand?

308
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Yes, sir.

309
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,460
I'll do it everyday.

310
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Thank you.

311
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Piccadilly solved the problems of the couple without even a single problem.

312
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
How amazing is his skill?

313
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,460
That was a wonderful scene.

314
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
How was it watching Matsumoto-san?

315
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Well, there was a bit of a sexual harassment scene.

316
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:32,460
I think that was because he was winning the role that I was playing.

317
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,460
If you're going to dry your hair, I'll make you wet.

318
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,460
That's a low-class compliment.

319
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,460
I think he's trying to be cool.

320
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
I wonder why he's so hard on his shoulders.

321
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Endo.

322
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Yes.

323
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,460
You're a bad guy too.

324
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
No, I'm not.

325
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
You're right.

326
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
You're a good guy too.

327
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
What?

328
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,460
You're a good guy too.

329
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Are you angry?

330
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
This is a Pikachu.

331
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,460
You can't do that.

332
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Say something nice.

333
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Sorry, Endo.

334
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
I don't know.

335
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,460
Well then, Kiyaki! I love you!

336
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Kiyaki is also a pervert.

337
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Actually, this time, a guest has come to Piccadilly.

338
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
This person, please!

339
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Piccadilly, my friend!

340
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Actually, this is the first time that Piccadilly has been caught by a manbiki G-man.

341
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
He's a long time G-man.

342
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Long time no see!

343
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Piccadilly, how are you?

344
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Because everybody loves you over there.

345
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
I know, I know.

346
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,460
But, you know, we gotta take my friend, yeah.

347
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Okay.

348
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,460
Oh, you're going to take him?

349
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,460
Yes, sure, no problem, honey. Whenever you want.

350
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,460
But you know, seriously, really, please don't.

351
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,460
But in Canada, shall we go?

352
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
You know, we have a lot of friends.

353
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
That's all!

354
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
What?

355
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Well, that's terrible.

356
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
If you're in snow, you're a man-bikini man.

357
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
The day of the emergency has come.

358
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
See you again.

359
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Goodbye!

360
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
You've closed it with force.

361
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,460
I want to know how many times you'll do it.

362
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Can I ask you a question?

363
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Sure.

364
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
As usual,

365
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,460
there are times when you put seeds in the umeboshi of the onigiri, right?

366
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,460
You don't understand what I mean, do you?

367
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,460
What does that mean?

368
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,460
It's absolutely wrong!

369
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
It's absolutely wrong!

370
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
Shut up!

371
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,460
It's absolutely wrong, isn't it?

372
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Shut up!

373
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,460
No, no, no, no, no.

374
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Hey, you know, that...

375
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,460
What? Are you angry because there are no seeds in it?

376
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,460
I ate a delicious rice ball the other day and there was a seed in it.

377
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,460
There are many people who get angry at that.

378
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
I will never get angry.

379
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Shut up!

380
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
I go to the gallery sometimes.

381
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
I go to the front door.

382
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
I will never get angry.

383
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
You are very angry.

384
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Why are you all angry at me?

385
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
I will never get angry.

386
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Why?

387
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm not angry at all.

388
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,460
Do you have seeds in convenience stores?

389
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Where did you buy them?

390
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,460
There are many rice balls like udon or delivery.

391
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Seeds.

392
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Delivery?

393
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Like delivery rice balls.

394
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Udon, rice balls, salmon, plum, I ordered a lot of them.

395
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
You can't do that.

396
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Don't I look like a student?
