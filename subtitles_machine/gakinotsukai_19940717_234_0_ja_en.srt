1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the middle of the night, it's time to go to the restaurant.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's hot.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you want to eat?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want to eat somen.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's eat somen.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I want to eat somen.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's delicious.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stop it.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The entertainment world.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The city without justice.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The city of bones.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The first to be cut off in the entertainment world is Yamazaki Hosei.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the second to be left behind is...

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The one who doesn't know what's scary.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Jimmy Owens.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The fight for justice.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I came to buy something.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You came to buy a swimsuit, right?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I came by car.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is Yamazaki's car.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is Yamazaki's car?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What's wrong with you?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Shut up.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Stop it.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're annoying.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's wrong with you?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why did you kick my car?

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why did you kick it?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was breathing.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why did you kick it?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's used.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Stop it.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Stop it.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why did you kick my car?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What are you doing?

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're a natural-born person.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can't drive like this.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're a natural-born person.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're a natural-born person.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop it.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Stop it.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Stop it.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Stop it.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Stop it.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Stop it.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stop it.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yamazaki is better than you.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He can do anything.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yamazaki can do anything.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's have a match.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's do it.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yamazaki is eating raw meat.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yamazaki is eating raw meat.

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Shut up.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yamazaki is like this.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yamazaki is like this.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yamazaki is like this.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll eat pork.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Pork is not good.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Pork is not good.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is this?

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is bacon with asparagus.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is bacon with asparagus.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you do this, I can't do it.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you do this, I can't do it.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you do this, I can't do it.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll do it.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll do it.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I like one.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is a video.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He is crying.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you do that, I can't show it.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll show you.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll show you.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He is crying.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you do this, I can't do it.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is amazing.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is amazing.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're good.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shut up.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Shut up.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Shut up.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't underestimate my Yamagaki.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is it?

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to eat all the curry powder.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's talking about spicy food.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's talking about spicy food.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hello.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's talking about spicy food.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She knows how to laugh.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can eat a lot.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is the victory of Yamagaki.

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The victory of Yamagaki.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You have an English book, don't you?

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You have an English book, don't you?

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
All right.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Did you see my head?

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
North Asian shop, she said.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You pass an coffee shop.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
A long, a long day.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can't complete.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What kind of person are you?

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is Yamagaki.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
North Asian.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
An coffee shop.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
An Latte.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What kind of person are you?

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you know what it means?

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
My Yamagaki doesn't know.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know what it means.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's obvious.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's eat cheese.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you stupid?

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are very good at the three-person book.

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What?

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Look at it.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Three-person book.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Three-person book.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are very good at SVOC.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Look at it.

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Listen to the English.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You don't know SVOC.

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You don't know SVOC.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I know.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The best part of the coffee shop.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why?

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't buy it.

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't say such a thing.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't lie.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's true.

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
My Jimmy is a little better in terms of nutrition.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Really?

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's strange.

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you say that?

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My Jimmy is hot.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No one loses.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No one loses.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My Jimmy is good anywhere.

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait a minute.

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's okay.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's okay even if it's in your ear.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Bite it.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't take it.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't know.

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Look at it.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm a man who does it when I do it.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Look at it.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Look at it.

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's hot.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's hot.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Finset.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hello.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't do that.

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I can't drink lemon juice.

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Really?

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't drink lemon juice.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't drink lemon juice.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Look at it.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't open your mouth.

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My Jimmy is cute.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't say such a thing.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who said such a thing?

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't say such a thing.

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't accept it.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's right.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go away.

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're cute.

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're doing a great job.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I haven't lost yet.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't say such a thing.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's none of your business.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
My Jimmy can't put a barricade in it.

178
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's impossible.

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know.

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
My Jimmy is cute.

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're doing a great job.

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right.

183
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My Jimmy can't put a barricade in it.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's impossible.

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't accept it.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What are you doing?

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
My Jimmy can't put a barricade in it.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Look at it.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're doing a great job.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't let you do such a thing.

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hey.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You know what?

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
My Jimmy is amazing.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He doesn't have a sense of shame.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't you feel embarrassed?

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Not at all.

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't wear a panty and run around the shopping street.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What?

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't tell me.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let me see it.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's amazing.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let me see it.

206
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yamanaki.

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's amazing.

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you think?

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's hot.

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's hot.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The other day.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's like a joke.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How many times did you shoot the Invention Shogun?

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Invention Shogun?

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've seen it twice.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You've seen it, right?

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I finished shooting.

222
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Shooting?

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You said it was a joke.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've been told such a detailed thing.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I can't talk.

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can't talk.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I finished shooting.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Invention Shogun.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I finished shooting.

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Leave it.

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I went to the toilet.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I left it.

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I finished shooting.

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I left it.

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was doing Invention Shogun.

237
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I left it.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I left it.

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There was no one.

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Someone came out.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okamoto.

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Manager Okamoto.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Good morning.

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He came out of the toilet and said hello to me.

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I said, oh.

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He went into the toilet next door and came back.

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's like Bruce Lee's tower of death.

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What are you talking about?

249
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Defeat the enemy once in a while.

250
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
When I saw the first time I went into the toilet, the toilet was floating.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is a low level as a human being.

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You shouldn't do it.

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You shouldn't do it.

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is today's opening.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Your spilling story.

256
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Spilling story.

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, that's probably the case.

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tell me the other day.

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Return it.

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Your spilling story this time.

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The other day.

262
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

263
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, there were a lot of things.

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There were a lot of things.

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't say it.

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, I'll leave it here.

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Leave it.

268
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What are you looking at?

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, when you're doing this kind of work, there are a lot of stories.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There are.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Then next time.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to do a special edition for two hours with a child.

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm talking for about 30 to 40 minutes.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, that's about it.

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The stupid staff here told me to do it for 24 hours.

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't say that.

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The guest can't leave for 24 hours.

278
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't sleep for 24 hours sitting all the time.

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He's talking.

280
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He's talking.

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't want to talk for 24 hours. I didn't want to do it.

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But I didn't want to talk for a long time.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I didn't want to talk for 20 hours.

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't do it for 20 hours.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But I can't go camping.

286
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't sleep or go camping.

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't go outside. I can't sing with everyone on the guitar.

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want you to do it for me.

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't go camping. I can't sing with everyone on the guitar.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I want you to do it for me.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I want you to do it for me.

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll recruit you. But I want you to do it for me.

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can't do it for 24 hours.

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I want you to do it for me.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want you to do it for me.

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I want you to do it for me.

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I want you to do it for me.

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wrote a fan letter the other day.

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a fan letter. I like you.

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know if it's a fan letter or a letter of opinion.

301
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I wrote a fan letter.

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I wrote a fan letter.

303
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I didn't write a fan letter.

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm a big fan of Machan.

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I told my friends at school that I was a fan of Machan.

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Everyone said it was disgusting.

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why? Why?

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Where is that old man?

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a flame.

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a flame. It's terrible to play with women.

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I wrote a lot of things.

312
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I wrote what I was told.

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I'm a fan of Machan.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not happy.

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why do I have such an image?

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll do something like that again.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll do something like that again.

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I heard a bad rumor about me.

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What are you talking about?

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I met a woman the other day.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I took her to my apartment.

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I told her.

323
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Which do you choose, sex or oolong tea?

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is there anyone who says that?

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If that woman wants to do it with me,

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If she says that, she'll say oolong tea.

327
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That depends on the person.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why?

329
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Which do you choose, oolong tea or sex?

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Which do you choose?

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's strange to say that it's sex.

332
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I wrote a lot of things like that.

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I see.

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's an enhancement period for comedy talents.

335
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Who else is being targeted?

336
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Matsumura.

337
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You said that.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
In front of the door of Matsumura's house.

339
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I wrote a bad rumor about me.

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's right.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't need it.

342
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's okay to write a bad rumor, right?

343
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What do you mean by a bad rumor?

344
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
When I opened the door of Matsumura's house,

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There was a cardboard.

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why?

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's strange.

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There was a bad rumor.

349
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There was a bad rumor.

350
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I opened it.

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
When I opened it, there was a camera inside.

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was looking at the front of the door.

353
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And Megumi.

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The one who was in the way.

355
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was like a light.

356
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know what happened.

357
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was standing still.

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I looked at the inside.

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There was a lot of camera lenses inside.

360
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's exactly what I'm aiming for.

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm doing this.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You should have finished cleaning earlier.

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I was doing this.

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you done?

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why are you so nervous?

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I said something.

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If I don't finish it now, it's a concentrated attack.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't care.

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I really care about you.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Me?

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I really care about you.

372
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I really care about you.

373
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's dangerous.

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't say that kind of stuff.

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Why did you say that?

376
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What kind of stuff is that?

377
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's harassment.

378
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why do you look up when you get on the elevator?

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know what to do.

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Humans want to know what's going to happen next.

381
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's why I'm looking up.

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why are you looking up?

383
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What kind of stuff is that?

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's weird.

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It was funny.

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You look up when you try to go up.

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You look up when you run forward.

388
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Explain it again.

389
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Are you an idiot?

390
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can't say that out loud.

391
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Listen to me.

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm going to get out of bed at night again.

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I got it.

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Are you going to rest tomorrow?

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't care.

396
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't know what to do.

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Humans want to know what's going to happen.

398
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's cool.

399
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's why I'm looking up.

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's why I'm looking up.

401
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What are you talking about?

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Are you really in the 18th chapter?

403
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What are you talking about?

404
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You were in the second chapter, right?

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The first chapter.

406
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What was it?

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's nothing.

408
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A little more.

409
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I think I was happy.

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you.

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's the first chapter.

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know what to do.

413
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's nothing.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're taking it off too much.

415
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It doesn't change much.

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It changes from the next one.

417
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I think I was happy.

418
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think I was happy.

419
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The 18th chapter has changed a lot.

420
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
From the second to the 18th.

421
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you know?

422
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I know.

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Do you know?

424
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Really?

425
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I know everything.

426
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What is 14?

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
14 is the best part.

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Please tell me 14.

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's nothing.

430
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's completely different.

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want to be a wild man like Macha.

432
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What is wild?

433
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I want to be a barretta who is always hiding.

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's nothing.

435
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's not wild.

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I want to be a barretta who is always hiding.

437
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Please tell me what you learn.

438
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I've been farming for a long time.

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I can't tell you that.

440
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How many do you have?

441
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I have about 27 or 28.

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Please tell me one.

443
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It doesn't matter if you have a lot of chocolate.

444
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Before you go to bed.

445
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You have to drink vinegar.

446
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Please tell me one more.

447
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Please tell me one more.

448
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Please tell me one more.

449
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I want to be a squirrel.

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I want to love animals.

451
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I want to love animals.

452
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I have a lot of things.

453
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Please tell me one more.

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What is it called?

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's a bird.

456
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm wearing it, but there's something on my back.

457
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm wearing it, but there's nothing on my back.

458
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Please tell me one more.

459
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's just a bird.

460
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm wearing it, but there's nothing on my back.
