1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone, good evening.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
First, Hanashika-san, please come out!

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is the 9th time I've attended the Oogiri-daigassen.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, is that so?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
During that time, a lot of new people have appeared.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's right.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Today's guests are strong opponents.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Very strong opponents.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's right.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Please introduce yourself.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I, the god of comedy, often come here.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The other day, when the three of us pulled the omikuji of the vending machine, Daikichi Daikichi came, and I was the only one who didn't win.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm Yoshimoto's Oochikoku Yaro, Yamasaki Osoji.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, nice to meet you.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He came 2 hours late.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, next to me.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I, with this Oogiri, would like to destroy the image of hohohoi.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hohohoihoi!

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Kogoriko Endo, please come out.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes, next to me.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm the child's servant Arahen, and my gyal is still 5000 yen.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have no intention of doing it tonight either.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm Kogoriko Tanaka.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, nice to meet you.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, the new person.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You didn't say it!

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Introduce yourself.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're amazing.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My name is Zatsu, in English. I'm a rat. I'm a little smart. I'm Gatsu.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sometimes, I appear on variety shows. I'm Gatsu Ishimatsu.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, nice to meet you.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, nice to meet you.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Today, I heard about Oogiri, but it seems that there is a smell of the wild on the side.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo's Tachi Hiroshikawa, Go Hiromi.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry, I'll do it again.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First of all, we have the Atakamo Club!

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Atakamo Club

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is it annoying? This is an order.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There is a book that has nothing written on it.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll give it to you in order.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Atakamo!

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please proceed with the story as if it has something written on it.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here!

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A Chinese Charisma, The Life of a Pigeon.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right?

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Isn't this good?

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Then, please.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A Chinese Charisma, The Life of a Pigeon.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The Pigeon...

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Loved Manman a lot.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What does that have to do with anything?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go!

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The food that the Pigeon is good at is, of course, as you know, Gyoza.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're talking about the life of a Pigeon.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you start like that, you'll get a trauma.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What should I do?

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Start from the birth.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The Pigeon is born with charisma.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Surprisingly...

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's strange.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Tell me where you were born in which year.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
1948.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was born in Canton.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The Pigeon had a strong fighting spirit when he was young.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He kept fighting in the next town and the next town.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He developed his own power.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Power?

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Power?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I like your stamina.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And the Pigeon met Chinese food for the first time when he was 15 years old.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's a good thing to say.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you don't tell me that, I don't know where I'll meet you.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And after three years of training, the Pigeon made the best food in the world.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The name is...

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The name is...

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The Chinese food made by Chin Chin.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It doesn't matter if you make it when you're in a bad mood or when you're having fun.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is Chin Chin a food?

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Chin Chin didn't add any chili and chili paste.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why?

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why is that?

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's written in the book, right?

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, it is.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why didn't you add it?

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's written in the book.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But when he was 20 years old...

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why didn't you add it?

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When he was in Shanghai, he had a trouble to taste the food made by Chin Chin.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He had a trouble to taste the food made by Chin Chin...

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, it's the other way around.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not ready.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You guys should learn from him.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey!

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's true.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The reason why Chin Chin was so charismatic was...

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He liked garlic.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He liked garlic so much that he bit the garlic.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He liked garlic so much that he bit the garlic.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He liked garlic so much that he bit the garlic.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Chin Chin...

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's leave that aside.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's move on.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want you to forget what happened before.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it written in the book?

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You should forget it.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's what Yasaki thought.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Chin Chin...

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Is he really that charismatic?

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's wrong with you?

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who are you talking about?

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What are you talking about?

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come here.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm getting sleepy.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm getting sleepy.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm getting hungry.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Next is the Headphone Dialogue Game!

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is the Headphone Dialogue Game.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you ready?

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We always play this game.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Everyone, please put your headphones on.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I will say a word from this side.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Please say it in order.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The first word is this.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you ready?

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
In the middle of the world.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In the middle of the world.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That was fast.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In the middle of the world.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In the middle of the world.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Say it as it is.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Here you go.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A big salad.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A big salad.

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A big salad.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's big, Gamera.

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's big, Gamera.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's big, Gamera.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
OK.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
OK.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Here you go.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's big, Tamori.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's big, Tamori.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OK.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's big, Tamori.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's big, Tamori.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's big, Tamori.

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't pretend.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
OK, Mr. Matsumoto.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Say the answer.

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's bigger than the world, Zabori.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What is bigger than the world, Zabori?

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The answer is this.

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's bigger than the world, Zabori.

159
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll do it again, so change the order.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll do it again, so change the order.

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll be the second.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Gachitan is the last?

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Gachitan is the last?

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then, Mr. Hose is the fourth.

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OK.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The question is this.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's good.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know what Mr. Matsumoto is.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know what Mr. Matsumoto is.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know what Mr. Matsumoto is.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll do it again.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll do it again.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't know what Mr. Matsumoto is.

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you sure?

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know what Mr. Matsumoto is.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't know what Mr. Matsumoto is.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't be stupid!

178
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't be stupid!

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't be stupid!

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Takaishi Daisaburo.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Takaishi Daisaburo.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Takaishi Daisaburo.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Takaishi Daisaburo.

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Takaishi Daisaburo.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hakaishi Daizaburou!

186
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
Hakaishi Dorobo!

187
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Hakaishi Dorobo!

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're really good at this!

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hakaishi Dorobo!

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hakaishi Dorobo!

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes?

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, Gata-san.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The correct answer is...

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A red stove?

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
From now on, according to Wild Ones' Memories,

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
everyone will sing one phrase at a time.

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes!

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When I come in front of everyone, I'll say, who's that?

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes!

200
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll imitate that person, and sing until the end.

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's go! Music start!

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I found you on this shore

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I can't stand on my own

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Keisuke Kuwata!

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Morishi Ichi!

206
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can't stand on my own

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ohiromi!

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Takami Yama!

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's too high!

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Sakuraga Junko!

211
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Junko desu!

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I said, Junko desu.

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It can't be Sakuraga Junko.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm embarrassed.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This order is so bad!

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Sanaka is delicious, right?

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Music start!

218
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I found you on this shore

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I found you on this shore

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't stand on my own

221
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Ohiromi!

222
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Wada Kiko!

223
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can't stand on my own

224
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Kobayashi Akira!

225
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't stand on my own

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Komori no Obachama!

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can't stand on my own

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't stand on my own

229
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's always delicious.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Tanaka Kakuhei!

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't stand on my own

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't stand on my own

233
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay, the last one is Takeda Tetsuya!

234
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to the waves.

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What is it?

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm going to win!

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going to win!

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's a kiss!

239
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's a kiss this time.

240
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The kiss character is here.

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Are you ready?

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't do this.

243
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The two kiss characters are going to separate.

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The first match is Yamasaki and Tanaka!

245
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's go!

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Excuse me.

247
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes?

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's very intense.

249
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's very intense.

250
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's start the match.

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The name of the beer is...

252
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Kirin Lager!

253
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Asahi Beer!

254
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Asahi Beer?

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No way!

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000

Let's start the first round.

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's coming! Don't look at me!

261
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The next one is Machigota and Tanaka.

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's a fake talent.

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000

264
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000

Hey!

277
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Of course!

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The lyrics were written by Kohaku in 1998.

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Ready!

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Speed.

Ready?

283
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000

285
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Grilli and Brie!

297
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It didn't come out in that era, did it?

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What?

299
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It didn't come out in that era, did it?

300
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're Grilli and Brie!

301
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There's no one like that anymore.

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yamazaki.

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Fight!

309
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll do my best.

Wait a minute.

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right?

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Which one?

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Zogman is here!

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know.

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Wait a minute!

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll move on.

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This is a reach.

337
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's a reach!

338
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a reach!

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's a reach!

340
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wait a minute.

341
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a reach!

342
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I just did it!

343
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No, no, no.

344
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You can do it.

345
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can do it.

346
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's a service.

347
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Sorry.

348
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You can do it.

349
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's a service.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000

This is a reach.

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Alright.

354
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Alright, let's go.

355
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Alright.

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm close.

357
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000

Wait a minute.

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Alright.

367
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'll move on.

368
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Isn't it fast?

369
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Alright, a reach.

370
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Double reach!

371
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is a reach.

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's close.

373
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You're doing it with a look.

374
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is close.

375
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's close.
