00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai, Tsukitsuki's physical weakness!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Where's your usual dandy Masumoto-kun?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why do you ask?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Your head is like this!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, I don't have a head, I can't fix it.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here, here.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can see that you're trying to fix it, but it looks like you can't do it anymore.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I can't do it anymore, my body is so tired.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You have a companion.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I can't do it anymore.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today is the opening.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Physical weakness.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's like a mental weakness.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
When you're ready, you have to do something.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When I'm ready, I can't do it.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When you're ready, I have to do something.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I see.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think I remember most of it by now.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One whole raw egg.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You have to put it on the side like this.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here's the face washing scissors.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm so ugly today!

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm wearing a wig.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, that's not it!

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is this the one?

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's right.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is it, right?

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, this is it.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is it.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is it.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't get it at all.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't peel it off.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You!

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's in here?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I thought you were going to touch this.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is it.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
See?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then...

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What?

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the hair dryer.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think this is it.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is it.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is it.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, this is it.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't say nonsense.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is it.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, this is it.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't say nonsense.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't get it at all.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's on top.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll lightly touch it.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
See?

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And then...

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ah!

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is it.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's not it!

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's not it!

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Glasses.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And then...

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is the hair dryer.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And this is the glass.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is it.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is it.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't say nonsense.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't get it at all.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And then...

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ugh!

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
See?

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's like a big wind.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is it.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is it.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
See?

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ugh!

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's gross!

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's blue!

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Next!

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is it.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is the raw egg.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you promoting it?

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What is this?

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is it a bird's nest?

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Can you put soy sauce on it?

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, I can't.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't put Rocky on it.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Can you do it one last time?

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I feel like I'm going to puke.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What is this?

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you going to do with this?

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Put this in your mouth and bite it.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ugh!

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then...

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like this.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Like this.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like this.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Like this.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Open your mouth.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It doesn't have to be Gingami.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gingami is more powerful.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What is that?

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then...

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Glass kick.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ugh!

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you an animal?

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't really like it.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't really like this.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is...

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't have soy sauce.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't have soy sauce.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What is this?

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Isn't this rotten?

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't care.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's okay.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's rotten.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's no way it's okay.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It hurts!

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hold my hand.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wow!

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's okay.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It doesn't hurt that much here.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It doesn't hurt that much here.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It doesn't hurt that much here.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What is this hand?

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It hurts!

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It hurts so much!

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It hurts so much!

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's okay.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's okay.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It hurts!

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Next...

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's nothing left.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There is.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It doesn't have soy sauce.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's all over my ears.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's okay.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Here.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There's nothing left.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why?

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why?

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mix it.

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mix it.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is this soy sauce?

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Isn't this sauce?

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's nothing left.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There it goes!

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That feels bad!

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can't put it into words.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's all.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wait, you can't eat 20 times as spicy as me.

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, seriously, I can't get excited even if you make me eat this much.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No, no.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't eat spicy food at all.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's fine, it's fine.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's good.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What kind of reaction is that?

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's like an animal squid!

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not like that.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's spicy!

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's spicy, but it's fine.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you kidding me?

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, it's fine.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's spicy!

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's spicy, but it's good.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If it's spicy, it's like this.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's like this.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you say that...

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's fine.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you going to do if you're happy?

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
At the end, your face will be up.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's spicy, but it's fine.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You have to eat 20 times as spicy as me.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's spicy, but it's fine.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's spicy, but it's fine.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why are you like this?

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Good evening.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Where is the video center?

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know where the video center is.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is this the video center?

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's talk.

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What should we talk about?

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Today, I'm going to give you some lessons.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is it?

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You often take a day off from work, right?

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sad.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not a day off at all.

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's my fault.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's my fault that I'm doing a different job.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My schedule is...

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It was a stupid schedule.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was on the train for two weeks.

195
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What is that?

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's an indirect bad word to Masakado Tamura.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, it's not.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a bad word.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, it's not.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I wanted to go back to work.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You wanted to go back to work.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I thought it would be bad.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
On Thursday, when I finished work,

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the moment I was relieved,

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I heard the sound of a sick horse.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What are you worried about?

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The sick horse is from Osaka.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm really sorry.

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There are a lot of bad words to the company.

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
On Friday, I often come here.

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I have work in Osaka on Thursday and Friday.

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I come here at the end of the day.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I only have one manager, Nitta.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Nitta is a guy who went to Hamada.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No, no.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Nitta is a guy who went to Hamada.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't come from another place.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you mean by that?

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You are not a person who is writing.

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I am writing.

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Nitta is a guy who went to Hamada.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He wants to be loved by Hamada.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What are you talking about?

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Nitta is a guy who has been assigned by the company.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He wants to be loved by two people.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Nitta wants to be loved by Hamada.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I am not writing.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Nitta wants to be loved by Hamada.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you talking about?

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He started his work because he didn't want to be a teacher.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He is a guy who is hated by the company.

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He wants to be loved.

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't want to be loved.

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You are wrong.

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you compare a guy and a girl,

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
they really like Hamada.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If they like Hamada, they can do anything.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's a complicated way to say it.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to be loved by Hamada on Friday.

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to be loved by Hamada on Friday.

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I want to be loved by Hamada on Friday.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, I will come to your office from Osaka.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What about the subway?

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Poor guy.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Please give it some time.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Tokyo ferries go very fast.

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Ready to go and it's raining too.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If we take a cab, things can get worse.

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We can't sit in unasel GabBai car.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why?

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't say weird things.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's you!

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why?

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The taxi drivers are lined up, right?

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Because you want to get on.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Line up!

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If you want to get on too.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No, no, no.

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They're really lined up!

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I know!

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But you can't get on if you're not lined up.

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Line up!

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
My body is already weak.

264
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want to go home quickly.

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I want to go home quickly.

266
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You want to go home?

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I want to go home quickly.

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't get on.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why?

270
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Line up!

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
How do you want to go home?

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You want to go home without being lined up?

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's not good.

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's not good.

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If it was a normal office,

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
they would have brought you to the station.

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You would have gotten on and left.

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's raining.

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why can't you be normal?

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, no, no.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's raining.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They're lined up in the rain.

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you go to the other side,

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
there are times when taxis stop.

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you cross the street.

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But there are no umbrellas.

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But if you go there,

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
there are a lot of people lined up.

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If you go there,

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
you'll get soaked in the rain.

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Even if you raise your hand like this,

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
the car won't stop at all.

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's just a little bit.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's full of mud.

296
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why is it full of mud?

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No, no, no.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It keeps running.

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, I see.

300
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It keeps going like this.

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're lying.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why are you lying?

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, no, no.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you do that,

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
they'll pour water from the other side.

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's amazing.

307
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's like a stain.

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like a stain.

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If you go back to the car,

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it's double the amount of water

311
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that you should have taken earlier.

312
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And then you go back again.

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It takes about an hour like this.

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You finally get a taxi.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And then you go home.

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Even if you take a taxi,

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
even if you give the receipt,

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
it won't come.

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It won't come, it won't come.

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is this?

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right.

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not up to 5000 yen.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If it's over 5000 yen,

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
there's got to be a reason.

325
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He's saying he took a taxi.

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That guy, Nozawa.

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Even though he's on vacation,

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
he gets paid.

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He's been on vacation for two years,

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and he's been paid the same salary

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
every month.

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's a stupid thing to say.

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's strange.

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So, as a company,

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
we treat Nozawa like

336
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
he's been on vacation for two years.

337
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's right.

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why do you think Nozawa is like that?

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Simply put,

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo is a talent

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
in the Tokyo section.

342
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes, yes.

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We are Yoshimoto Kogyo,

344
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the head of the Osaka branch.

345
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's the difference.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The head of the Osaka branch

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
seems to be nicer.

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's not true.

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We have a higher rank

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
in the Tokyo branch.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You don't understand that.

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's the difference.

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But now,

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yoshimoto is in downtown,

355
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and he's having a hard time.

356
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's not because he's angry with me.

357
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's because...

358
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No, that's not true.

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's all up to the business.

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If I go,

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
she'll probably say,

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
do you want to go to Nanbo?

363
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's what she'll say.

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I say,

365
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
do you want to go to Nanbo?

366
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then she'll go to Nanbo.

367
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's what she says.

368
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Why didn't you say bye this year?

369
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What do you mean?

370
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're in charge of the business.

371
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No.

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I told you I'd go with you this year.

373
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll go, but I'll support you.

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Really?

375
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes, really.

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You'll have to go with me.

377
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What's that?

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I thought you'd say that, too.

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay, I'll go with you.

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll go with you.

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you say no, I'll go with you.

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're from Hakata?

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's obvious you're from Osaka.

384
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't have any money.

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Please do your best.

386
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't have any.

387
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You don't?

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I have the same amount of money.

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You should have some left.

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What are you going to use it for?

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Even if it looks like this, it's not.

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're so funny.

393
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How much do you eat?

394
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I eat a lot.

395
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How much do you eat at a BBQ restaurant?

396
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's amazing.

397
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The cows are like, give me a break.

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What do you mean?

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The cows are like, give me a break while you're eating?

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Or the cows are like, give me a break.

401
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The cows are like, give me a break.

402
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The cows are like, give me a break.

403
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The cows are like, give me a break while you're eating?

404
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The cows are like, give me a break while you're eating?

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're so funny.

406
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're so funny.

407
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're such a joker!

408
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're such a joker!

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm serious.

410
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm serious.

411
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm serious.

412
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Look, I won.

413
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
On this show.

414
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This fucking local in Tokyo.

415
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was on other shows all over the country.

416
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This guy...

417
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He was amazing.

418
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can't live in the entertainment world anymore.

419
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You know...

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What?

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He's cutting a pumpkin.

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is he making?

423
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
He's cutting a pumpkin.

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Everyone's pushing him.

425
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What do you think you're doing?

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're cutting a pumpkin.

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

428
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who did you shoot?

429
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Well...

430
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You know them, right?

431
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Mr. Sekiguchi and Ms. Takagi.

432
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes, yes.

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And Yamashiro.

434
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I know I'm cutting a pumpkin.

435
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I know I'm cutting a pumpkin.

436
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't do anything.

437
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Mr. Sekiguchi is faster.

438
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're cutting a pumpkin.

440
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're cutting a pumpkin.

441
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're cutting a pumpkin.

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What are you doing?

443
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You know...

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What do you think you're doing?

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Mr. Sekiguchi and Ms. Takagi.

446
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
They're all white.

447
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm surprised.

448
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
In the end,

449
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Mr. Sekiguchi's answer was different.

450
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I knew it.

451
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I told them to make me do it.

452
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm a performer.

453
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And when Hamada did it again,

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Mr. Yamashiro did it.

455
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yamashiro!

456
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And when Mr. Yamashiro answered,

457
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
it was different again.

458
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Mr. Sekiguchi did it again.

459
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Mr. Sekiguchi said

460
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it was a jam.

461
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And Hamada was like,

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I thought I got it right.

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But it was a boo.

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're wrong.

465
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You can't just go around

466
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
with the answer.

467
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Please play the guitar.

468
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What?

469
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What did you do?

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't say anything.

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
When you came out,

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I was surprised.

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I can't say anything.

474
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What do you think?

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The monkey came out.

476
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I told him to come out.

477
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's amazing.

478
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's amazing.

479
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
My name is Lioness Asuka.

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
My nickname is Lioness.

481
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Lioness.

482
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Stop it.

483
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm the world tag champion

484
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
of the AAA.

485
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You're getting excited.

486
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You should have told me earlier.

487
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I've been racing lately.

488
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm in the middle of it.

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can't fit in the normal size.

490
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Why did you think

491
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you were going to race again?

492
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I wanted to do something

493
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
other than pro-wrestling.

494
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I like dangerous things.

495
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
After the pro-wrestling,

496
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I want to put myself

497
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
in a dangerous position.

498
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We're the same age.

499
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you 38 years old?

500
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not an old man.

501
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Are you a rabbit?

502
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, I'm a rabbit.

503
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I was watching you today.

504
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I had a baby

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
with my wife.

506
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

507
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you.

508
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's okay.

510
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's okay.

511
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You're so annoying.

512
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you a mother?

513
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is like a doll.

514
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you.

515
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What are you going to do if you fall asleep?

516
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Thank you so much.

517
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you so much.

518
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Thank you so much.

519
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you.

520
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This is how

521
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
people who want to be a celebrity

522
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
look like.

523
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's so hot.

524
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't take off your clothes.

525
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hello.

526
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I had a lot of guests

527
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
at the last special edition.

528
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
When Hibino Kazuhiko

529
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
wore it,

530
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I designed it.

531
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The T-shirt is ready.

532
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is the back.

533
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
This is the front.

534
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is the back.

535
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
This is the front.

536
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This is the back.

537
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is the front.

538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is the back.

539
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This is the front.

540
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This is the front.

541
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is the back.

542
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This is the front.

543
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the front.

545
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Roll it up.

546
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Everything is okay, right?

547
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Everything is perfect.

548
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ta- Having clothes that are puffy is

549
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
nice right?

550
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're so lame!

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So lame!

552
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It was good, wasn't it?

553
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you very much.

554
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The people who are watching will decide.

555
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If you want it, you'll want it.

556
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And next time,

557
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Let's surprise Ui-chan and Nan-chan.

558
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Tonight, the Grand Champion is

559
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
on April 8th, Monday,

560
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
from 7pm to 2am.

561
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's right.

562
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We're also looking for an assistant and a letter.

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Everything is the same.

564
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
