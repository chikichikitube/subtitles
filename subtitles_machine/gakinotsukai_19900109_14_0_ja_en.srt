1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, look at this. It's Udon because it's cold.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Don't mess with me!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And where is this place? Look at this, everyone.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm alone in a place like this.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a temple. In a cemetery.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My staff was cold earlier.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When this is over, they say that something is reflected in the bag.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I thought, where did they all come from?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If my staff feels bad in a cold place, they all come in a T-shirt.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Next week, everyone will be in a T-shirt for the opening.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Otherwise, I can't go from next week.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is JR's Higurezato Station.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's go!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is Nippori Station.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Everyone, here we are.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sunny Hall. It says, Nippori Sunny Hall.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is a school building.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, there's someone eating lunch over there.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please stand by the camera.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is strange.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Was there only one person in downtown?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good evening.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What is it?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good evening.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How is it?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's ready.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Where did you come from?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This shitty staff.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How is it?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's good.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's good, isn't it?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why are you eating lunch here?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is it?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
From now on, all the staff in the location will come in a T-shirt.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Even if it's a T-shirt, it's like a 24-hour TV show.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everyone will be there.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's it.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Nippori Sunny Hall will be opening tonight.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nippori Sunny Hall

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This program is brought to you by Sunlux,

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oyama International Products,

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the following sponsors.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
My name is Jean-Paul Delmont.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just arrived in Japan, but I'm a student from America.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But my curiosity is amazing.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't understand Japanese at all, but I came to Japan alone.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Papa, mama, this is my sister's extro-noodle.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is Japan.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's still me!

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you looking at?

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What is this Japanese doing?

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If I don't apologize, if I don't do something,

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't speak Japanese at all.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sushi.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't you say sorry when you bump into someone?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mi-Mifune.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Say sorry!

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Say sorry!

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Say sorry!

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry!

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Say sorry!

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry!

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry!

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Nissan.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Nissan.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is that?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Toyota.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Toyota!

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You only know Japanese words.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Say sorry.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Say sorry!

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Say sorry!

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Say sorry!

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Say sorry!

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry!

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry!

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry!

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry!

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Say sorry when you bump into someone.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't you understand?

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Did you see it?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you understand?

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Say sorry at the end.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Say sorry at the end.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No!

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Say sorry at the end.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then I was in a panic.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I studied Japanese with a sense of shame.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I like Kengo more than you do.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Say it.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Look up.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No!

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What?

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Say sorry at the end.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What is it today?

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There were a lot of good things.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It was a little bad.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you dressed like this?

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I won.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's better to wear this.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You look like a bully.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I just had a haircut yesterday.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It doesn't matter.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm wearing this because it's short.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I lost.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't accept it.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's been a long time since this program started.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a beautiful hall.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've never seen it before.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think it's the first time you've seen it.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't know.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think it's always like this.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There was a place like that.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There was a place like a octopus room.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There was a baby crying.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What is this place?

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't like children very much.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't like children very much.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why?

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't like children very much.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But if a small child comes here, I can't do it.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I like dogs.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I like dogs.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You don't look good.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I like dogs.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Really.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll do this if I'm in trouble today.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can laugh for sure.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I shouldn't have shown it so early.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll show it again next time.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I really like dogs.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't like children.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Children are stupid.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's why I hate children.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think I was stupid when I was a child.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I know that I was stupid when I was a child.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Children really don't care about the distinction of things.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't help it.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm serious.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know the difference between an old man and a young man.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How old are you?

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was born in the first year of elementary school.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't care.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's normal that you don't know.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If you knew the difference between an old man and a young man in the first year of elementary school.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I didn't know the difference between an old man and a young man.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was a child.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I thought that I would be punished.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't know the difference between an old man and a young man.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was a child.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have a young aunt.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I didn't know the difference between an old man and a young man.

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You've seen it from the old man's perspective.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I didn't know the difference between an old man and a young man.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Also, he thinks about what he is being seen as.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ah, he's a coward.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's a coward. That's true.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He's a coward.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's being told that he's cute and he thinks he's cute.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, yes, yes.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He thinks about it.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He's a sukebe.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's a sukebe.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's why he says that children are really innocent.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All of it is a lie, right?

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All of it is a lie.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When I was a child, I was single.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Even now, I'm like this.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where is it?

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know.

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Aren't you Kurikuri?

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm not Kurikuri.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When I came in front of a beautiful lady, I was like this.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I wanted to be Kurikuri.

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought so.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
After all, there are two types of people, cute and ugly.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Men and children.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ah, since you were a child?

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, if you're in front of a cute person, you're like this.

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're like this.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're like this.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're like this.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're so sad.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
After all, if you see an ugly person, you're like this.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Today, I asked for your autograph.

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
My mother said that too.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Did your mother give you an autograph?

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Right?

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
My daughter gave me a letter.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
She gave you a letter?

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She gave me a letter.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I should have read it.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh my.

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When I read it, your mother looked like an old man.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not like that.

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Your mother is very fashionable.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There are old men, women and old men.

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Today, I don't have an assistant.

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't have one?

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I only have an autograph.

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll take the address again.

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A lot of people came today.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'd like to introduce them.

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A little while ago, I was talking about your fans.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
People around me are like this.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They are just people around me.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The first fan is my fan.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He has big eyes.

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He has long hair.

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He is over 160 cm tall.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He has a good style.

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He can wear a skirt or jeans.

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He has thin legs.

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He has good taste.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He is my fan.

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The second fan is Hamada's fan.

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He has thin eyes.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He has oily hair.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He is short.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He is fat.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He has a bad taste.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He has thick legs.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You are annoying.

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is true.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's not true.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm a fan of Matsumoto.

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are a liar.

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm from Yokohama.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
My name is Ryoko Toda.

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You are a fool.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Toda.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Next.

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is...

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When did you two meet?

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How did you know each other?

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Please tell us a funny story of your childhood.

251
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know if it's a funny story.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I met you for the first time.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
When I was in elementary school.

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When I was in elementary school...

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I knew your father better than you.

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The green uncle.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes, the green uncle.

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
When I was in elementary school, I had a land sale.

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Wait.

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right?

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was raised with that money.

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't make fun of me.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But it was hard for your parents.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The most impressive thing was when I was in 4th or 5th grade.

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Elementary school students usually have land sales for 6 years.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But they don't dress up like that.

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This guy is really over the top.

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He is a skip school kid.

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He was a skip school kid.

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He was wearing a perm when he was in elementary school.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He was wearing a perm.

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He was wearing a blazer.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He was wearing a white jacket.

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He was wearing a long jacket.

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He had no choice but to have a land sale.

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He was wearing a bag that looked like a bag from the movie.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
When I was doing a land sale, I had a bag like this.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He was wearing a baggy.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It was called a pantalon.

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was shocked when I saw it for the first time.

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It was called a culture shock.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was shocked.

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Who is this guy?

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We became friends in 12th grade.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
12th grade?

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, we did a lot of things at other people's houses.

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We did a lot of bad things.

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
When I was in 12th grade,

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know if there are people who know this,

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but it was a foreign underwear incident.

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was amazing.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There was a friend's apartment.

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A foreign woman lived next to it.

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She put a washing machine at the entrance.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know why,

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
but she wanted to go to take off her underwear.

297
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
She didn't want to imitate a child watching TV.

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The two of us were in the washing machine.

299
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
When I opened the washing machine and grabbed it,

300
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
she said,

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't take off your underwear.

302
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The foreign woman said,

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't open the washing machine.

304
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was scared.

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When I opened the washing machine,

306
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
she said,

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't open the washing machine.

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It was scary.

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There are many foreigners in Tokyo now.

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There weren't many foreigners in Japan at that time.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It was a suburb town like us.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I thought it was an international problem.

313
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was excited to go home.

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was excited to go home.

315
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We did a lot of bad things.

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Today is the last day.

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Osaka dialect?

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

319
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My head is a jingle.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know what a jingle is.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Konbaba.

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Konbaba.

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You know this, don't you?

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Konbaba.

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Answer me.

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't you know what a konbaba is?

327
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just as it is.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Konbaba.

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Konjoubaba.

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You don't know what a konjoubaba is, do you?

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is no konjou.

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's a baba.

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Konjou is bad or dirty.

334
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Baba means poop in Osaka dialect.

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Konjou is like poop.

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Dirty.

337
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Baba means dirty.

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Konjoubaba.

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Konjoubaba.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Sarapin.

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you know this?

342
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Sarapin.

343
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What?

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What?

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
For example, there is shampoo in the bathroom.

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This is sarapin.

347
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Freshly washed?

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

349
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You don't say it's freshly washed.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, it's fresh.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You don't have to wear it.

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You don't have to wear it.

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What is it?

354
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't know.

355
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

356
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Ah, dog.

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Do you say dog today?

358
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In Osaka dialect, we say kairu.

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If you say kairu, you say dog.

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What's wrong with that?

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's true.

363
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What about Ichiogami?

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Ah, now.

365
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm doing it on TV.

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's a voice that makes you cry.

367
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm hungry.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's hard.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can go home.

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm the type of person who falls down while looking at the castle.

371
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm scared.

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm dying.

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't do anything.

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I want you to get out of here.

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't want to.

376
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm the type who gets in the bus on my way to school.

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't sit on the window sill.

378
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There are women I love.

379
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who does that?

380
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't.

381
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I can't.

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm thinking about sleeping.

383
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I can't sleep.

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can't think about twisted things.

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't think about that.

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I thought about it and thought about it and thought it.

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Tempura or something?

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
Croquette or something?

389
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
Croquette or something?

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's the worst.

391
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I thought, it's not oily.

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I thought about it and thought about it, but I couldn't.

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I couldn't stand it anymore.

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I opened the window and said, I don't know if it's like this.

395
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I opened the window and said,

396
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Boo!

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You're in that world.

398
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I want to spit out.

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's how it goes.

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Boo!

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Boo!

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Boo!

403
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Boo!

404
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But

405
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You know, there's a saying,

406
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if you're seen by a real woman, you can't spit it out with one shot.

407
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But I'm a Full Moon.

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's the power与r love.

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Boo!

410
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What do you think of this?

411
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,000
Sensei, something is sleeping in my moistment.

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It smells like water!

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Masumoto-kun!

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes, I'm coming!

415
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The teacher is sitting in the auxiliary chair.

416
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Wait a minute!

417
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Masumoto-kun, are you okay?

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, yes.

419
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Masumoto-kun, are you okay?

420
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's right.

421
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When I thought about it, everyone was like,

422
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, no, no!

423
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's right.

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't like it.

425
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's the type, right?

426
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's the type.

427
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This guy used to be a bad guy.

428
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There was a time when the two of us worked part-time at Snack.

429
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
In this world?

430
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
In this world.

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It was a full-time job.

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We worked part-time at Snack.

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I was a night watchman.

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I worked part-time at Snack.

435
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There were a lot of night watches.

436
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There was no train going home.

437
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
My mother would tell me to go home in a taxi.

438
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I took a taxi and went.

439
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I still have the feeling.

440
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm on the bus, so I can't do it anymore.

441
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I opened the window and went straight.

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I was about to start talking, but I was like this.

444
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I was like this.

445
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I couldn't stand it, so I got on the bus.

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I opened the door.

447
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
At that time, I couldn't do it anymore.

448
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I got off the bus.

449
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I got off the bus.

450
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The driver came out.

451
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The driver came out.

452
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Are you all right?

453
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I opened the door.

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I opened the door.

455
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I opened the door.

456
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I opened the door.

457
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I opened the door.

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I opened the door.

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's funny.

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's funny.

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I had to step on his back.

462
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I was scared while doing the lots of things.

463
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I was scared.

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was laughing at him from the side.

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll have to do my best as a partner.

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I have to do my best as a partner.

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
In the meantime, I was doing the lots of things.

468
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I laughed.

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I laughed because he was so funny.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I laughed because he was so funny.

471
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I was laughing because I was laughing.

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Because he was laughing.

473
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was like this.

474
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ha ha ha ha!

475
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, well, well, well

476
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I won't imitate the kid on TV

477
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, no!

478
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, so what is today?

479
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Bebe!

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Maybe not bebe

481
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Let's go with dog

482
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So, say, I say!

483
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What do you call it?

484
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,460
Well, let me do one like this.

485
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,420
Here you go.

486
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,360
If you say, grenades go-ahead.

487
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,460
Let's practice this one.

488
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,500
Now, goods go-ahead!

489
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,940
What is this?

490
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,800
This girl is probably called Patrick.

491
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,980
But at least don't go in yourert.

492
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:04,980
That's all for tonight. Thank you very much.

493
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
See you next week!

494
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
See you next week!

495
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,980
I thought a lot about what to do next week.

496
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
I don't really like it.

497
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,980
I don't really like this kind of stuff.

498
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,980
But I want to do something special.

499
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,980
You speak so clearly.

500
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Something special?

501
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I want to see this.

502
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,980
What do you want to see?

503
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
I have to do this.

504
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
I have to talk about this.

505
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
What is it?

506
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Rolling Thunder Man.

507
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,980
I'm really looking forward to the opening.

508
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,980
The camera, lighting, everything.

509
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,540
In a yellow T-shirts.

510
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,980
Love is to save the world.

511
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,980
Love is to save the world.

512
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,980
I'll do this cover.

513
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
What do I do?

514
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,980
I told Nirvana.

515
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
It's cool.

516
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Have Unchained come.

517
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
Do it!

518
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,980
And, the last one, will come to L.A.

519
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,980
And L.A. will be our home.

520
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
The location is also important.

521
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Do it like this.

522
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Like this.

523
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Turn it around.

524
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
That's how you do it.

525
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
That's how you do it.

526
00:23:33,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Thank you.
