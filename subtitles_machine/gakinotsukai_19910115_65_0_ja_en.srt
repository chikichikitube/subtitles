1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good or bad, it's up to you!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is terrible!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
My sons are in trouble!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is terrible!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Shall we go now?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's go!

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
First of all...

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Shut up!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I won't start!

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
First of all...

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, Futsuo!

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Futsuo!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes!

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Futsuo!

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is it, dad?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Futsuo!

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why didn't you tell your dad?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You threw the cigarette away in the toilet, didn't you?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry, dad.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I thought it would be nice if your cigarette was even one less.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I...

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Futsuo!

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was thinking about your dad's health.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry, dad.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Futsuo!

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Futsuo!

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is it, dad?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Futsuo!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You...

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What is it?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What is it?

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You threw the cigarette away in the toilet, didn't you?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What are you talking about?

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why do I have to do such a thing, dad?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why did the white smoke come out of the toilet?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Dad, I'm sorry to say this, but...

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That white smoke is not a cigarette.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What?

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's the smoke of my poop.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It can't be helped.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Go home.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey, Futsuo!

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes?

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You were hiding from your dad and throwing the cigarette away, weren't you?

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why?

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, it's okay.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I see.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Go home.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You shouldn't smoke.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Close the door.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hurry up and close the door.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm in trouble.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't close it.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Who the hell are you?

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hey, Futsuo!

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Futsuo!

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes?

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Futsuo!

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What?

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think dinner is ready.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's for dinner tonight?

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I knew it.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come in, come in, come in, come in.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Come in, come in, come in, come in.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hamburger?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop it if you're embarrassed.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Futsuo!

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Futsuo, come out again.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's for dinner tonight?

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come in, come in, come in, come in.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't be so loud.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you a little embarrassed?

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Futsuo!

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes?

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's the matter, dad?

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think dinner is ready.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What's for dinner tonight?

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Today's menu is...

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Marmalade-style...

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What?

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think dinner is ready.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's for dinner tonight?

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Dinner?

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Dinner?

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is my recent dinner.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I put a page here.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know why I put a page here, don't you?

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't like dirty jokes.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't say stupid things.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right?

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a bad guy.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Next work.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey, Futsuo!

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's the matter, dad?

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Futsuo, it's...

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's a new year.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Think about it.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The one who worked hard for a year last year was downtown, wasn't it?

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think it was Nan-chan.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's right, dad.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What?

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can ask the customers.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who thinks it's downtown?

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who thinks it's Nan-chan?

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Come here!

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Futsuo!

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't say such a thing.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Who thinks it's Denden?

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey!

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yoshio!

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes?

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What's the matter, dad?

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's a different story.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The one who worked hard for a year last year was downtown, wasn't it?

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think it was Nan-chan.

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's right, dad.

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What?

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's definitely downtown, isn't it?

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The staff also cooperated, didn't they?

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Warubo!

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes?

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Warubo!

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes?

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The one who worked hard for a year last year was downtown, wasn't it?

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think it was Nan-chan.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes?

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who thinks it's Denden?

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not Denden.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's Konstantin.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The last one!

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Futsuo!

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's the matter, dad?

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Futsuo!

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's the matter, dad?

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What are your favorite words?

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, I love the Giant Army.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like Nakashima-senshu said, the Giant Army is immortal.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right?

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Did you just say the name?

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The name of the name is...

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, whatever.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yoshio!

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's the matter, dad?

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's the matter, Yoshio?

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What are your favorite words?

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I'm a genius, so geniuses come when they are forgotten.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's not a big deal, though.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, I'm glad it was fast.

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Warubo!

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Nanji!

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Nanji!

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Warubo!

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Tabitabi Nanji!

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Tabitabi?

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What's the matter? What are your favorite words?

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are your favorite words?

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's not it.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, it's not that. It's your favorite word.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Kamishihougatame!

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's a good one.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's your favorite word.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a four-letter word.

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A four-letter word?

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Gaden, gaden, minsui.

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's a four-letter word like that.

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Daisuke Hanako.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Tonight, we're going to have a ginden show!

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Good evening.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Good evening.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're here.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What is it?

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're here, so say more.

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like a hotel.

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's the first time.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's the first time?

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why?

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
My outfit today certainly looks like Frankenstein.

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you don't like it, don't wear it.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't care.

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The stylist is going to think of this as me.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But that's...

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The stylist is going to wear the clothes prepared by you.

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I really don't know.

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If I don't like it even a little bit, I don't like it.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're going to step on the kindness of that person.

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you kidding me?

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Seriously.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I thought this was good, so she prepared it.

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I know that.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know that.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I'm the one who's going to wear it.

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The people watching the TV are going to say,

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Ah, it's the clothes that Mach-chan is wearing.

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's true.

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's like I chose it myself.

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's why I was told,

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is Hamada-san.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you think this is expensive,

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can wear your own clothes.

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's right.

212
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you think about it.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So the people watching the TV,

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is all my hobby.

215
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you go to a clothing store and look for it yourself,

216
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You'll think about it a lot.

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's something terrible about it.

218
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is wrong.

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You really need to understand this.

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's right.

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I thought it was written on the paper that it was wrong.

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's why,

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
On TV, everyone...

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What was the name of my stylist?

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Um...

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Nakasone.

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's not it.

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What's Nakasone?

229
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't even know the real name.

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why are you laughing?

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't even know the metaphor.

232
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why are you laughing?

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I know it's wrong.

234
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Isn't it Uesugi?

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, it's Uesugi.

236
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What's Nakasone?

237
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're the first one to laugh here.

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's the real thing.

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There's a lie.

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a lie because I know the real thing.

241
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you guys?

242
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Nakasone.

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't need a comment.

244
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's Uesugi?

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I know he's doing his best, but...

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you bring it to me and tell me it's wrong,

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going to get mad.

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm going to do my best so that I can get the next one to come.

249
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right?

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's right.

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm tired.

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm so tired.

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How many times do you think about it?

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How was it?

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I had a hard time when I thought it was okay.

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's Konno Blazer.

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The sleeves are like this.

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's right.

259
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The waist is like this.

260
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's like Yasu-san.

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, no, no.

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's another one.

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He's...

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We can't fix it.

265
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
On the contrary.

266
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
On the contrary.

267
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If you leave it alone, Yasu-san will bring it to you anytime.

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, that's fine.

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What did you do on New Year's Day?

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Quite a lot.

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, it's nothing.

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I had a bad New Year's Day.

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What?

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I had a bad New Year's Day.

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It was on the second day of the New Year's holiday.

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
My bicycle was stolen.

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I couldn't afford a bicycle.

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Which one is on the second day of the New Year's holiday?

279
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It was on the second day of the New Year's holiday.

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
My bicycle was stolen.

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I couldn't afford a bicycle.

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I went home and stole it from Yuta.

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Your father?

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My father.

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I thought I had to go to the police.

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I had a registration number.

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I should have had a reason to do that.

288
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I looked for it, but I couldn't find it.

289
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If you say that suddenly,

290
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
you'll be locked up in a cell.

291
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And what did my father do?

292
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He came.

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He was the best.

294
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well...

295
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He was the best.

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't say that.

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He was the best.

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He was the best.

299
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I thought I had a reason to do that.

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I had a registration number.

301
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I should have had a reason to do that.

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I looked for it, but I couldn't find it.

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't say that.

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't understand because you're doing that.

305
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I went to the temple.

306
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I was beaten by my mother.

307
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was beaten by my mother.

308
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because of my mother.

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have a screw in my head.

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because of my mother.

311
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I said, it hurts!

312
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But he hit my father again.

313
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I said, what are you doing?

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He hit me like this.

315
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It was the worst.

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It was hell.

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He stopped my brother.

318
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What did you do?

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

320
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What did you see?

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I was like this all the time.

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was your fault that we had a fight.

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What?

324
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You were the one who got hit.

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But it wasn't easy.

326
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
My father didn't hit the temple.

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You shouldn't hit your mother's temple in front of your son.

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Mother?

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're a beautiful woman.

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What are you talking about?

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In slow motion.

332
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was like this.

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What should I do?

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But it's not a big deal now.

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

336
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

337
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I go home sometimes.

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

339
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I go home sometimes.

340
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The other day.

341
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I went home.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I was going to go home this year.

343
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I was going to go home in two days.

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was going to go home.

345
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You had two days off.

346
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

347
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I was sleeping in the morning.

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I got a call.

349
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I was wondering who it was.

350
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was my mother.

351
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
She said,

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's been a long time.

353
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're so brave.

354
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
She said,

355
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Happy New Year.

356
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was surprised.

357
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why?

358
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Seriously.

359
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Seriously.

360
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why?

361
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was scared.

362
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why?

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I was scared.

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
My mother's mother.

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What should I say?

366
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I was scared.

367
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was scared.

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was scared.

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't want to see you anymore.

370
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't talk much.

371
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes.

372
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Your father is a bad guy.

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sometimes.

374
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He's desperate to make things better.

375
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I know that.

376
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you mean by bad guy?

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Your father is trying to make you look like a bad guy.

378
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Your father is trying to make you look like a bad guy.

379
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know about that.

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Your father is trying to make you look like a bad guy.

381
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're talking like that.

382
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It doesn't matter.

383
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But you're asking me something good.

384
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is it?

385
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So,

386
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What are you wearing?

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Your hair?

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why is it so shiny?

389
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What's wrong?

390
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It doesn't matter.

391
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So,

392
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I thought you had a way to answer.

393
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know if it's the right answer.

394
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's so annoying.

395
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's like,

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Is this leather?

397
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's it.

398
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know if it's the right answer.

399
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know if it's the right answer.

400
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You can just go home after a day.

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
My sister is,

402
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
She's funny.

403
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
She's good at laughing.

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Really?

405
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes.

406
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I used to laugh a lot.

407
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Your sister?

408
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

409
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
About 20 years ago,

410
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
She was on the phone.

411
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Her sister was on the phone.

412
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hello?

413
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Is it your mother?

414
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please wait a moment.

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Your mother is on the phone.

416
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Who is it?

417
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Beans?

418
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Beans?

419
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What is it?

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hello?

421
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's Mr. Endo.

422
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Did you go home?

423
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I didn't go home.

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So,

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When you go home tomorrow,

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You said tomorrow.

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're talking like that.

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You said tomorrow.

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When you go home tomorrow,

430
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You said you would go home.

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What are you talking about?

432
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You said you would go home tomorrow.

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't care about you.

434
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm talking to you.

435
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll go home.

436
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Please don't go home.

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm frustrated.

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll never go home.

440
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll go home.

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's hot.

442
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What were you doing on New Year's Day?

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

444
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't want to do anything.

445
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't do that.

446
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't do that.

447
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Are you going to go home?

449
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't go home.

450
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If you want to ask me something, ask me.

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What do you want to ask me?

452
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What do you want to ask me?

453
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What do you want to ask me?

454
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What are you wearing?

455
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is Long Keep Gel.

456
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's been a long time since I applied it in the morning.

457
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You applied it in the morning and left it as it is?

458
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's right.

459
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You didn't apply anything?

460
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's right.

461
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is...

462
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is this just beautiful?

463
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's right. This is beautiful.

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How much is this?

465
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How much did you apply?

466
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is 80,000 yen.

467
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is 80,000 yen?

468
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you shave your beard?

469
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you shave your beard?

470
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
When did you shave your beard?

471
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What?

472
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
When did you shave your beard?

473
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I shaved my beard today.

474
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You have a lot of beard.

475
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This...

476
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What happened to your beard?

477
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Please come out.

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hello.

479
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hello.

480
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You don't have a lot of beard.

481
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You don't have a lot of beard.

482
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What's your name?

483
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm from Tokyo.

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Can you lower it a little more?

485
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Can you lower it a little more?

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Then it's fine.

488
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why do you look like you're going to cry?

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's fine even if I lower it this much.

490
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Stop talking.

491
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What's wrong with you?

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Thank you very much.

493
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you very much.

494
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Thank you very much.

495
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey.

496
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What is this?

497
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm having a great time with my family.

498
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
A lot of idols and stars are releasing photos.

499
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How about you, Mr. Down Town,

500
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
releasing a photo album of your downtown?

501
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I've released it before.

502
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I've released it before.

503
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Really?

504
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
A photo album.

505
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
How is it?

506
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's good.

507
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You don't think it's funny to release a photo album?

508
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You don't think it's funny to release a photo album?

509
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What the hell?

510
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's what I'm saying.

511
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's fine if you draw it the way you want it.

512
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You don't have to do it like this.

513
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Don't tell me you're going to quit.

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But I can't take it off unless it's Shinoyama Kishin.

516
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Are you a model?

517
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What are you talking about?

518
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If it's Shinoyama Kishin, I'll leave it to you.

519
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What are you talking about?

520
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's see.

521
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You can't draw?

522
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You're saying that the first class is better.

523
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's try it.

524
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's take a picture.

525
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Really?

526
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's try.

527
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I can't do it unless I'm in a studio.

528
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I can't do it outside.

529
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,360
There's a

530
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I can't do it unless I'm in a studio.

531
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There's a

532
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can't do it outside.

533
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why?

534
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm really weak against fire.

535
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Right?

536
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't open my eyes when I'm outside.

537
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm strong.

538
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm serious.

539
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I can't go to the zoo with three, four, or five animals.

540
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You're smiling and smiling.

541
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I can't take a picture of me smiling and smiling in front of a lion.

542
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I can't take a picture of me going to the zoo with three animals.

543
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Because it's too bright.

544
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I can't do it.

545
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're going to try again.

546
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't take a picture of me going to the zoo with three animals.

547
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't do it.

548
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can't go to the zoo with three animals.

549
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Are you a barbarian?

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Look at that.

551
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's white.

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm angry.

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm angry.

554
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let's think about it.

555
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let's take a picture.

556
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's take a picture.

557
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's do it today.

558
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I didn't sleep today.

559
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know.

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You played with me.

561
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm not feeling well.

562
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm not feeling well.

563
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You played with me.

564
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You?

565
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You.

566
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You.

567
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You.

568
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I really don't know.

569
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You don't know what?

570
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What?

571
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You don't know what?

572
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You had a dream, didn't you?

573
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I didn't dream.

574
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Were you worried?

575
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I didn't dream.

576
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I went to the apartment on purpose.

577
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I said I wouldn't come out even if I played the guitar.

578
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I said I wouldn't come out even if I played the guitar.

579
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I thought I was going to die.

580
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't know why, but I was hanging on the balcony.

581
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was hanging on the balcony.

582
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I thought I was going to die.

583
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was worried.

584
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Why did you go?

585
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I thought I was going to die.

586
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hello.

587
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hello.

588
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's it.

589
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let's do our best this year.

590
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What?

591
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's a program.

592
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It has a meaning.

593
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's do various programs and do various things.

594
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I see.

595
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Last year, we cooperated with everyone.

596
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Everyone who watches TV cooperated with us.

597
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We did various things.

598
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's do our best this year.

599
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's right.

600
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And...

601
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The assistant is no longer...

602
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What?

603
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Assistant?

604
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I've been using a professional recently.

605
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's use a handsome guy.

606
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What are you talking about?

607
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What?

608
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
A handsome guy?

609
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm a handsome guy.

610
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm a handsome guy.

611
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's not funny.

612
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What?

613
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Even if a man wears it?

614
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Even if a woman wears it, it's funny.

615
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't say that.

616
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Women are more funny.

617
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's it.

618
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We can't use a guy.

619
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Let's do our best this year.

620
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's do our best this year.

621
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Give me your hand.

622
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Give me your hand.

623
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Say goodbye.

624
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Say goodbye.

625
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Open your hand.

626
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Say goodbye.

627
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Goodbye.
