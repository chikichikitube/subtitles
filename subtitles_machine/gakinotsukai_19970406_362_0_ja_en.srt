1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hamada Masatoshi, 33 years old.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The man who has never been injured before is...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
fractured.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, we will continue with the project of emergency fractures.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's take a look at the audience of Hamada-chan.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, Hamada...

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
fractured his arm.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think he didn't actually do it.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He did it because he wanted to get everyone's attention.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ah, because he was lonely.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's not true.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, I didn't.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He was really fractured.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's a big deal.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's a big deal.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In downtown, one of the four legs is broken.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One of the legs is gone.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If one of the legs was missing, he wouldn't be able to eat.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's all broken.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For now, let's call him over.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's call him over.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The main character is Hamada-san.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Please come in.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ah, it's good, it's good.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Ah, it's good.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's good to be in a place like this.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, that's how it is.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't know what the purpose of this trip is.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm a little annoyed.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is it?

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know how many talents are in Japan right now.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There are a lot.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know who is going to come to see me.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're not coming?

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not coming.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're not coming alone?

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Look at these things.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ah, it's the past.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah, with magic.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Look at this pure white dress.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I loosened it once.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I rewound it.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In the past.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At that time, I was wearing it.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Kimura Takuya was wearing it.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's true, it's true.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You want to say something like that, right?

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's true, it's true.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's a lie.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a lie.

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's true, it's true.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It seems that my son is also playing.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My father.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are looking at.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This concept is to give a lucky bag prepared by the entertainer here.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It means that you will be given a lucky money for sure.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
However, many entertainers are gathered at Ikuta Studio.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ah, at Ikuta Studio.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't think that they would come like this.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Today, Hamada-san, look at this.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is a magical set, right?

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, yes, yes.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Today, we are shooting a magical set.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I see.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's why there are various things.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ah, it's Hideki-san.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hideki-san.

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What's wrong?

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ah, it's already...

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ah, something terrible has happened.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I fractured my bone.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Didn't you pierce it?

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, I didn't pierce it.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You didn't?

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Didn't you know that?

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't know.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ah, this is already bad.

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Right?

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah, you came to see me?

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, I came to see you.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ah, you came to see me?

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ah, you came to see me?

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ah, I see, I see.

88
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good luck.

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you look at this, you will understand.

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because there is no one coming.

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Since you came, you should write a sign.

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ah, that's right.

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Please write here.

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Good luck.

95
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There are various things.

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It doesn't matter.

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It doesn't matter.

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Good luck.

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It doesn't matter.

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's the first time.

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Good luck.

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Ah, it's good.

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ah, thank you very much.

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's wonderful.

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I should write a sign.

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, it's good.

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's good.

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's hard to get something like this.

110
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's hard to get something like this.

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And, well...

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There are various things.

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When you get sick, it will take a long time.

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's a waste of money.

115
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

117
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, thank you for your hard work.

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, I have prepared some things.

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ah, I see.

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is that?

121
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have prepared some things.

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Since Hamada is like this, we have nothing to do with each other.

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

124
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hideyoshi-san also has some relationship.

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well...

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There is also a place that looks like a foreign car.

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What?

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a good memory.

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But, it's scary.

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have been to a bad place.

131
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This silhouette is good.

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's amazing.

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What?

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It hurts.

136
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What is it?

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What is it?

138
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hong Kong.

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What is it?

140
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's moving.

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you.

142
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother.

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What is it?

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have received something.

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wait a minute.

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can I see it now?

148
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Can I see it now?

149
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's see it.

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There is nothing to say.

151
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It hurts, right?

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It hurts.

153
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You came all the way here.

154
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is it?

156
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is it?

157
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I did it.

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Moreover, Hideki is a close-up.

159
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's amazing.

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's amazing.

161
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Really?

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's good.

163
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's good.

164
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's really cool.

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please take a commemorative photo with Hideki-san.

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you talking about?

167
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's the first time in this world.

168
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm so happy.

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Cheese.

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He received 50,000 yen from the downtown.

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good morning.

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Shingo-chan is here.

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good morning.

175
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Good morning.

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Shingo-chan.

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What happened?

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I saw it in the newspaper.

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why didn't you come?

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where did you go?

181
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I came to see you.

182
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Shingo-chan signs while receiving unreasonable comments.

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are a great person.

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It hurts, right?

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It hurts.

186
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right?

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hang in there.

188
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't do that.

189
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right?

190
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's terrible.

191
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There is no end to it.

192
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There is no end to it.

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't do that from the stairs.

194
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is it?

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's in the middle of Kagai-sha.

196
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In the middle of Kagai-sha.

197
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll wrap it up.

198
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Shingo-chan was taken by surprise.

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Max is here.

200
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Max.

201
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is he alone?

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't know it would be like this.

204
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is a big deal.

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Shingo-chan, write something here.

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Can I write?

207
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Shingo-chan was caught after taking a dump.

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's not a dump.

210
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What were you doing?

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was peeing.

212
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Really?

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Were you hiding and peeing?

214
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Max is here.

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is an unexpected development.

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I received a present from Iegaki Takahashi.

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

218
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a miracle.

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

220
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What about Max?

221
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Max is amazing now.

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's amazing.

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hair.

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

225
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't need that.

226
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Everyone, write something.

227
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A lot of people are here.

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A lot of people are here.

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A lot of people are here.

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Really?

231
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

232
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was worried.

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Kato is here.

234
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Everyone.

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Of course.

236
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Everyone, write something.

237
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Everyone, write something.

238
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Everyone, write something.

239
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I've been watching you guys for a long time.

242
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You've grown up.

243
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Write something.

244
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm just a socialite.

245
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The four teams were not able to get any money.

246
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Bando.

247
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's been a long time since I've seen Bando Eiji.

248
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Bando.

249
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Good morning.

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Good morning.

251
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I've been waiting for you.

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Really?

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Really?

254
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right.

255
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Really?

256
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Bando Eiji.

257
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is the staff of Magical.

258
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Bando Eiji.

259
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Happy birthday.

260
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Happy birthday.

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it your 30th birthday?

262
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's good.

264
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's just in time.

265
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

266
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Masao.

267
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

268
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Please give me a bag.

269
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a big deal.

270
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a gift.

271
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

272
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then give it to me.

273
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is what I'm talking about.

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Good.

275
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Good.

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They got 10,000 yen.

277
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There are a total of seven stars in Ikuta Studio.

278
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
As a result of the situation, Downtown went to the next destination, Kinuta Studio.

279
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The goal is 2,300,000 yen.

280
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What?

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
2,300,000 yen.

282
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
2,300,000 yen is not enough.

283
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Who will give me that?

284
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I have to buy a bus with a lift.

285
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not that kind of guy.

286
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We've arrived.

287
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The more I thought about Ikuta, the worse the entrance was.

288
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you a gold digger?

289
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There are some other talents here.

290
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There are.

291
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's wait here.

292
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hello.

293
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll take you home.

294
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's right.

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go to the place where I can relax on my way back.

296
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right.

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

298
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Will Tamura Masakazu and other big talents get two gold diggers?

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Here he comes.

300
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Who?

301
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Rasane.

302
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you.

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hello.

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's been a long time.

305
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's been a long time.

306
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's right.

307
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please sit down.

308
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Please sit down.

309
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

310
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't know.

311
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know.

312
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What?

313
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

314
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is what happened.

315
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I see.

316
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't come to see you.

317
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What?

318
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We came to see you.

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We came to see you.

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We have this.

321
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll write to you.

322
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll write to you.

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll write to Mr. Ishida.

324
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll write to Mr. Ban.

325
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is a max.

326
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is a big blue.

327
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right.

328
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Can I write here?

329
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, you can't.

330
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's not good.

331
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll write to Mr. Takagi.

332
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Can I write to you?

333
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, you can't.

334
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's hard.

335
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Mr. Takagi and Kabukai.

336
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Mr. Takagi wanted to write to you.

337
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He was so desperate.

338
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I won't miss you.

339
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Where did you get the treatment?

340
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is what happened.

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It doesn't have anything to do with you, does it?

342
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Wait a minute.

343
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What do you mean?

344
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But you're not the victim, right?

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not the victim, but...

346
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If you think about it that way, you're the victim of a distant place.

347
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why do you say that?

348
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've prepared something like that.

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Of course, there's nothing inside.

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's a light-weighted power supply that uses electric waves.

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's not that.

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey, Rasaka-san.

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Huh?

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's...

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not that.

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you making such a lame joke?

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's not like I'm making a joke.

358
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait a minute. What's that?

359
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll take a picture of you.

360
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll use it when I need it.

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's bad.

362
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's bad.

363
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What are you talking about?

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is going to be written all the time.

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This is the only thing that's not over.

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Four or five times a year.

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What kind of life is this?

368
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Ishii-san seems to be in a lot of pain this year.

369
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Because of the lack of power, he decided to make a sudden phone call.

370
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hello?

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, hello.

372
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm always in your care. I'm Matsumoto from downtown.

373
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Good morning.

374
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you Shohei-san?

375
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Glasses!

376
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Good morning.

377
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm Mahito.

378
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm with my partner.

379
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, yes.

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's like I want to see you.

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's like, don't you miss me?

382
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What are you doing?

383
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm practicing golf right now.

384
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you playing golf?

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll be right back.

386
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, yes.

387
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hello?

388
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, hello.

389
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you in Uchipanashi?

390
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes, I'm in Uchipanashi.

391
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is that so?

392
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

393
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to see your face, so can I go?

394
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Ayaki-kun is playing.

395
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please practice.

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

397
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Excuse me.

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, yes.

399
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I can't hear you anymore.

400
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Didn't you feel suspicious?

401
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, I did.

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Matsumoto-san.

403
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Nia is over there.

405
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes, she is.

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
She's completely aware of the camera.

407
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
She's looking at us.

408
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She's looking at us.

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's terrible.

410
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Ah, Nia.

411
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She's coming to my private room.

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why are you wearing black glasses at a time like this?

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, no, no.

414
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What do you call it?

415
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yellow glasses.

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

417
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Is that something you wear at work?

418
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
When I was in the army, I wore yellow glasses.

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Ah, yes, yes.

420
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When I wore black glasses, I wore Kishi Hiroshi.

421
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's not it.

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's Hoshi Hiroshi.

423
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I finally met you.

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, no, no.

425
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

426
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, no, no.

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a big deal.

428
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a big deal.

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Do you know what it is?

430
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Ah, what is this?

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What is this?

432
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It must have hurt.

433
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It must have hurt.

434
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I've heard a lot about it.

435
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're going to do something like that.

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't do anything.

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I couldn't sleep last night because I was hungry.

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's a big deal.

439
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're not responsible at all.

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're not responsible at all.

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, that's true.

442
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, this kind of thing.

443
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, I don't know if I should put it in.

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He won't do it, so I'm tired of it.

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm tired of it.

446
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Normally, well, what do you say?

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not going to bring this kind of thing.

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And, um, what do you say?

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think it's better to think about it.

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's what the staff said.

451
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We talked to each other.

452
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, that's right.

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No, I don't want to talk about you anymore.

454
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry to cut it off.

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry to cut it off.

456
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's funny.

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's funny.

458
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Are you going to look at the rest of it?

459
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Of course.

460
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I know how to do it.

461
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You know how to do it.

462
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
How do you do that on the show?

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're going to tear it up.

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Why are you tearing it up?

465
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why are you doing this?

466
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're going to tear it up.

467
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a place where you can edit.

468
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Thank you very much.

469
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Please be careful.

470
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Let's take a look at it.

472
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you going to do it all of a sudden?

473
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We're having a hard time wrapping this up without making a fool of ourselves.

474
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I think it would have been better to be a fool, right now.

475
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No, no, no.

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's okay to be a fool.

477
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't think it's okay to be a fool.

478
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's not like that.

479
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's not serious, is it?

480
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not serious, is it?

481
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You don't have to be a fool.

482
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's not a fool.

483
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You don't have to be a fool.

484
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I think we should have been a fool.

485
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't be silly.

486
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You look like an old lady.

487
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's better now than being silly.

488
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Why?

489
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If there is a silly thing that goes beyond now, it's fine.

490
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The director of the second film, Shohei, gave him 30,000 yen.

491
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And the two of them decided to aim for something big at the end.

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm with Hamada right now.

493
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What about Hamada?

494
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hamada is very worried.

495
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What?

496
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He wants to meet Nagao.

497
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's talk to him.

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hello?

499
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Good evening.

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Akira?

501
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Where are you?

502
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Can I talk to you?

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Can I talk to you?

504
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm in Ginza right now.

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What?

506
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm in Ginza.

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Are you going to Ginza?

508
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm going to Ginza's bar.

509
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Ginza's bar?

510
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm going there.

511
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What?

512
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes.

513
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm going there.

514
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What?

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think that the director of the film, Tatekawa, and the director of the film, Katsura, might come.

516
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know if the director of the film will come.

517
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Akira, wait a minute.

518
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Akira, wait a minute.

519
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Do you want to talk to the director of the film, Tatekawa?

520
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No.

521
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What else?

522
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
In the film, Kamioka.

523
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Kamioka.

524
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He's a great actor.

525
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I just talked to the director of the film, Kiyaru.

526
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know who he is.

527
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know who he is.

528
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I understand.

529
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Excuse me.

530
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you.

531
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Thank you.

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm leaving.

533
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Please understand that the director of the film is not a person who can be trusted.

534
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is a difficult place.

535
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is a difficult place.

536
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm going there.

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can't go there.

538
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Is there a guy, a woman, or a Kamioka in Ginza at night?

539
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The director of the film, Kiyaru, has no idea.

540
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The director of the film, Kiyaru, has no idea.

541
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The director of the film, Kiyaru, has no idea.

542
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The director of the film, Kiyaru, has no idea.

543
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Mr. Kazunosu.

544
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,500
Yes, yes.

545
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,000
Could you please tell me where you're from?

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, I'm not sure where I'm from.

547
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't really know where I'm from.

548
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Nia.

549
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Nia.

550
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Go ahead.

551
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Were you there?

553
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes, I was.

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Who was there?

555
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Mr. Nagao was there alone.

556
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He was sitting in the back of my seat.

557
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Alone?

558
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes, he was.

559
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He was sitting in the back of my seat.

560
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, I see.

561
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's go now and go home quickly.

562
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes.

563
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, there he is.

564
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How are you?

565
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, hello, hello.

566
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, hello.

567
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, hello.

568
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Good morning.

569
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Good morning.

570
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm glad Akira was alone.

571
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What should I do if there's a member I was talking about earlier?

572
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm glad you came today.

573
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, really?

574
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You've been drinking a lot, haven't you?

575
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes, I've been drinking a lot.

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh, these two don't drink.

577
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't drink.

578
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't drink.

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't drink.

580
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If I could drink...

581
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Aren't you going somewhere after this?

582
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, I'm not going.

583
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're not going?

584
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

585
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why are you looking at me with such scary eyes?

586
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is that so?

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I heard you were grumbling.

588
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You can't drink, can you?

589
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't drink.

590
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But you're really okay, aren't you?

591
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm okay.

592
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, Mr. Taisa...

593
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You knew, didn't you?

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Mr. Nagao, right?

595
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I knew.

596
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hama-chan asks for a chance to get a signature while taking a break.

597
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
For the rest of my life...

598
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the pain...

599
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
will remain.

600
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hey, you!

601
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In a sense, this is...

602
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
reverse love.

603
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
For the rest of my life, the pain will remain.

604
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Thank you.

605
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You should feel it as pain.

606
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I see.

607
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You've been working hard.

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You've always been working hard.

609
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's right.

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You've grown up, haven't you?

611
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Thank you.

612
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, today...

613
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

614
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No, no.

615
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Akira came here because he can't drink.

616
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's right.

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you knew, you would have come.

618
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I wonder why he can't drink.

619
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I won't go.

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why not?

621
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't drink at all.

622
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I see.

623
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Why is that?

624
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If I go, I'll die.

625
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Really?

626
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes.

627
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Akira.

628
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes?

629
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I have a favor to ask you.

630
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What is it?

631
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Is that so?

632
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Well, well.

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's about the sword.

634
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh!

635
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
As expected.

636
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Of course.

637
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's right.

638
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was going to bring this.

639
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, that's great.

640
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
When I met you the other day,

641
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I was going to give you this.

642
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But...

643
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You were there.

644
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So what if I was there?

645
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You were next to me.

646
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You were always looking at me.

647
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You didn't know that I was there.

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Wait a minute.

649
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You were looking at me.

650
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I was looking at you.

651
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You were looking at me.

652
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I was looking at you.

653
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I was looking at you.

654
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You were always looking at me.

655
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why did you look at me?

656
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's not something you can show in front of people.

657
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's right.

658
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Go over there.

659
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, I see.

660
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry, Naha-chan.

661
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
All the movements around here are the same, right?

662
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's the same for everyone.

663
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's not something you can do in front of people.

664
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
For him,

665
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't want him to see my wallet.

666
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Well, then.

667
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's been a long time.

668
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You still want to see it?

669
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes.

670
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's like this, right?

671
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Thank you very much.

672
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What is it?

673
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Thank you very much.

674
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You don't like it?

675
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you very much.

676
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I like this.

677
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm a painter.

678
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Really?

679
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Really.

680
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Really?

681
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm a painter.

682
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is amazing.

683
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Right?

684
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm a painter.

685
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Well,

686
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm a little more.

687
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What?

688
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm a pretty good painter, too.

689
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What?

690
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, then.

691
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What is it?

692
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Why are you laughing?

693
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Are you lonely?

694
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Everyone will come one day.

695
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's right.

696
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's right.

697
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's why I want you to buy it soon.

698
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll send it to you.

699
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
No, it's okay.

700
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's okay.

701
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's okay.

702
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's okay.

703
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

704
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

705
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

706
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
All right.

707
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm sorry.

708
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's light.

709
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thank you very much.

710
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I want you to give me a piggyback ride.

711
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's funny.

712
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, really.

713
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Everyone is watching.

714
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Isn't this a great picture?

715
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It was a great picture.

716
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Did you think about running for president?

717
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I didn't think about it.

718
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Did you aim for a promotion?

719
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I didn't think about it.

720
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
NAKO gave me a piggyback ride.

721
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He gave me three pictures.

722
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There are 10 victims of the opposite side.

723
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Hama is also very happy.

724
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll tell you.

725
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If there are other people, I won't give you a piggyback ride.

726
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It hurts.

727
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We are very painful.

728
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you so painful?

729
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We can't give you a piggyback ride.

730
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm really sorry.

731
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We are painful.

732
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you very much.
