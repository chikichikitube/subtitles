1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the 6th episode of Gaki no Tsukaiya, let's play the original game of Chikijiki Gainin Kouan!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is the 6th episode of Gaki no Tsukaiya.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, it's already the 6th episode?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like this kind of game.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Because I get involved with various young people.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm happy, but Hamada is getting more and more exposed.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What do you mean?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't like the atmosphere of OI.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's not just Hamada.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Because it's fashionable.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't worry about that person.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm just doing what the script says.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Did you have such a script?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Did you write it?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll take two pictures.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
First of all, the first group.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We are the Yacchanai Master.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
My name is Suehiro Garisu.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We are Tate Matsuri.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is the game we brought.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your voice is like an old man's voice.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't do that face.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You look like an old man on TV.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't laugh.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's it.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is the game that Suehiro Garisu brought?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is the game.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There are many theaters in Omiya and Makuhari.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There is a writer called Higashiyama.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He is a young writer.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This game is very interesting.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I brought the most interesting game.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is the acrylic docking painting.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is it?

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is the game.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Five people will draw a picture on the acrylic board by dividing it into parts.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you put the parts on the acrylic board and complete the picture, you win.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I see.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I understand.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I will give you an example.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
For example, if the subject is a lion, I will divide it into parts.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One is the outline, one is the nose and beard, one is the mouth, one is the eye, and one is the vertical hair.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Divide it into parts and dock it at the end.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think I can do it without Hamada.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I look forward to working with you.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Have you ever seen a motorcycle from above?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
why?

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can't do that.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is the perspective of a Kamen Rider.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is the perspective when riding and crossing.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I thought you were a genius.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I look forward to working with you.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's start with the first question.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is the first question.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My name is Mishima from SUEHIROGARIZU.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will draw Mishima.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will draw Mishima's face.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will ask you to decide which part to draw.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The first is the outline, the second is the nose, the third is the mouth, the fourth is the eye, and the fifth is the hair.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Where is Hamada?

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I will draw the mouth.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will draw Tanaka's outline.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will draw the outline.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will draw ENDO's nose.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will draw the hair.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will draw the hair.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will draw the eyes.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will draw the eyes.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What did I think?

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will draw Mishima's face.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I will draw Mishima's mouth.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You said it first.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I said yes.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is good.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please draw Mishima normally.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Everyone, please draw.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is a face that is easy to draw.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is simple.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is not difficult.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Everyone has a sense of size, so if you draw differently, it will come out or be too small.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you have common sense, you will be good at drawing.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is easy to draw.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is easy to draw.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He closed the lid.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is fast.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hamada, please draw.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is easy to draw.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is easy to draw.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He drew it.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will draw the outline of Tanaka's face and ears.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm looking forward to it.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think this is good.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Please draw.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please draw the outline of Tanaka's face and ears.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Next is ENDO's nose.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is easy to draw.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is close to this place.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ENDO's nose is close.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is close to this place.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is close to this place.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is close to this place.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Please draw it again.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please draw it again.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, but, yes, it's a little different, isn't it?

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The touch has changed.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The touch is different.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go to Matsumoto-san.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is pretty good, isn't it?

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm following the side side.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I should have drawn it here.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's right.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's doubled.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see, I see.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's hard to draw a person here.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is the first time, so let's clear it.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm glad to hear that.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
OK, OK.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It was as good as that.

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I wanted to do that.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's cute.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's move on to the next topic.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can do it again.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Here it is.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The topic is Downtown Matsumoto-san.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Matsumoto-san.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you like people?

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is it an animal?

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think animals are good.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I drew it on the back of the flip as you thought.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you very much.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You have to divide the animal into five parts.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I see.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's difficult.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's still a normal old man's face.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a phenomenon.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a phenomenon.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's Kinga Shinno.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Congratulations.

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The topic is over here.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's okay.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's hard to divide the parts.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's right.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is an interesting idea.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's an interesting idea.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a topic.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right.

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How about this?

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is the topic.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is a giraffe.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a giraffe.

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Is that all?

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's the whole thing.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not a face.

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have no choice but to go that far.

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Face.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's go from 1 to 5.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Face.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Neck.

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Body.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Body.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I think it's okay.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is it vertical?

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's decide vertically.

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's vertical because it has a neck.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're expecting it to come around here, aren't you?

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's right.

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Please write it down.

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The body is almost the same, isn't it?

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm the legs and the tail.

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What do you mean?

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's fast.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I did it.

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a game that Mr. Higashiyama came up with.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're talking about Mr. Higashiyama.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's like Mr. Higashiyama is bad.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know that.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know that.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know that.

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But if it goes well, it's okay.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If it goes well, it's okay.

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The tail is bad.

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Only the tail is bad.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Only the tail is bad.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Only the tail is bad.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tanaka, who draws the tail, is bad.

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Tanaka doesn't have to draw that.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He didn't have to draw that.

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If I say too much, I'll get a pie thrown at me.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm scared.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll transform into Tanaka.

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Acrylic Docking Painting

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
A challenge to divide a giraffe into five parts.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Will it be a success?

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If it goes well, it's okay.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I want you to draw well.

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Please draw well, Tanaka.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's great.

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's great.

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's go in order.

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go in order.

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Where should I start?

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's start with the face.

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's start with the face.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please.

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
First of all, the face.

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Will it work?

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's add this.

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The face came in the center.

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's bad.

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know which one is the center.

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is it this one?

224
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The center is strange.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's say the whole thing.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This way of thinking is strange.

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I thought so.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, no, no, no.

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But even if you shift it, the picture is a little bad.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll do Acrylic Docking Painting.

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Masumoto's neck.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Please draw the neck.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But it's like this.

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not a problem.

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But it wasn't bad.

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a good position.

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The position is perfect.

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Mr. Hamada's torso.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's thin.

241
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Think about the thickness of the pen.

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Please match the thickness of the pen.

243
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Think about the TV.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What is this?

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's thin.

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why did you use a thinner one here?

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Everyone is fat.

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Please draw the legs and tail.

249
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't think it's that off.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But if you match the face.

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If you match the face, the rest is just.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Finally, the pattern.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Disgusting.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Disgusting.

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There are too many.

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's not even a pattern in the first place.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's like a scale.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Please shift the face.

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Please shift the face.

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you match the face a little more.

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But what do you think?

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you ask me what this is.

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The wrinkles on the pattern.

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you change this.

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's Tanaka.

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's bad.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's right.

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But if you ask me what this is.

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I think it's Kirin.

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's okay.

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I feel like I can do more.

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I feel like I can do more.

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is a good topic.

274
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's not a face.

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I think everyone who sees this will be able to play.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm thinking about a lot of things.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Acrylic is close by now.

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'd like you to use it.

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you very much.

280
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Next, let's have the actors appear.

281
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Here you go.

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's coming out like this.

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I got it.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I got it.

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I got it.

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I got it.

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's what I was doing.

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm AOKI SAIZO SUYAMA.

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've never seen you before.

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I've never seen you before.

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is the fifth year of his acting career.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is the game that AOKI SAIZO SUYAMA came up with.

294
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I brought this.

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was excited when I was doing a drinking party with comedians.

296
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I brought this.

297
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here it is.

298
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a double minus one game.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Thank you.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Please prepare a card.

301
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll have you draw only one card from your deck.

302
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Please double the number written there.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'd like you to draw one more.

304
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The person who says the number the fastest will get the card.

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I see.

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a little confusing to draw one over two.

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right.

308
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The person who said the number wrong or the person who said the number wrong will get the card.

309
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's just me.

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I got it.

311
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The Joker is also confiscated.

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The person who answers the question next can take the card.

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a game where you can turn the tables at once.

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's the kind of dream I had.

315
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm doing it right now.

316
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're doing it right now?

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're doing it right now?

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm doing it right now.

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you.

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you talking about your dream?

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, I'm not.

322
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'd like to do it with you from now on.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you have the right to refuse?

324
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't.

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Then you have no choice but to do it.

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Then please.

327
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, please.

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
All right, I did it.

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
When you draw one card, you have to say it's two times minus one game.

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I see.

331
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The number that comes out wins.

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I just have to put it here, right?

333
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'd like you to start with me.

335
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll do it.

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Here we go.

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Two times minus one game.

338
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What is this?

339
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Since Joker came out, it will be confiscated.

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's not funny at all.

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No, it's not.

342
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not funny at all.

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think I'm the biggest victim.

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Can I get Joker back in there?

345
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think you should eat it.

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Can I?

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Please.

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's an elephant.

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Please say it's an elephant.

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Say it's Seyama.

351
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's Seyama.

352
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Is Seyama your real name?

353
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's right.

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is it the same for you?

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No, it's not.

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's not?

357
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, it's not.

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How long have you been eating?

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's go.

360
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you get it right?

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes.

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Are you nervous?

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Two times minus one game.

365
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Twenty-five.

366
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Twenty-five is the correct answer.

367
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's fast.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What?

369
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Really?

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What?

371
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're not that strong.

372
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why? It's easy.

373
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It was really fast.

374
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I didn't think 13 would come out of the blue.

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I panicked.

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Really?

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's go.

378
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can calculate everything.

379
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Two times minus one game.

380
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
17.

381
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
17 was the fastest for Hosei.

382
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was fast.

383
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It was fast.

384
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We said it.

385
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We said it.

386
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
By the way, I'm participating, so I'll answer the numbers.

387
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Go ahead.

388
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can I answer before Hosei?

389
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I know you're participating, but you got it first.

390
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You got it first.

392
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I got it first.

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Did you get it?

394
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I got it.

395
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I didn't edit it.

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Wait a minute.

397
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What? It's really fast.

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You didn't say it clearly.

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Two times minus one game.

400
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
11.

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
11.

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No.

403
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hasegawa was faster.

404
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Really?

405
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

406
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Really?

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hasegawa was faster than Hasegawa.

408
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I was definitely faster than Matsumoto.

409
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hasegawa was faster than Matsumoto.

410
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

411
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Really?

412
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hasegawa was slow.

413
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm the judge, so I'll answer the numbers.

414
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're participating.

415
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're participating, but you're the judge.

416
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's right.

417
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's my role, so let me play the game master.

418
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You can do whatever you want.

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll ask Hosei.

420
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll ask Hosei.

421
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Here we go.

422
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
One, two.

423
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Two times minus one game.

424
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
13.

425
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
13.

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's Hosei.

427
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Wait a minute.

428
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It was fast.

429
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was pretty fast, too.

430
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I said it, too.

431
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I said it, too.

432
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It was pretty fast, so I said it, too.

433
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's Hosei.

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's because you're next to me.

435
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's right.

436
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's right.

437
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Listen to the whole thing.

438
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm saying it at the same time.

439
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Then I'll spread it out more.

440
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then I'll spread it out more.

441
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Two times minus one game.

442
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
25.

443
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's me.

444
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's not me.

445
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's two times minus two games.

446
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Say it's minus three when you do it.

447
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's do that.

448
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's do that.

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's change it.

450
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Let's do that.

451
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll play all the games.

452
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You don't have to judge.

453
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You don't have to judge.

454
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't have to judge.

455
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's a rule book.

456
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a rule book.

457
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll do it.

458
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Next.

459
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Please press minus two.

460
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll do it.

461
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Two times.

462
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You should have said that from there.

463
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You should have said that from the song, too.

464
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You should have said that from the song, too.

465
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
For example, I'll do it.

466
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Five times minus nine games.

467
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who can do this?

468
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
55.

469
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
46.

470
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Two times is the same.

471
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll ask you what to draw with two times.

472
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You have to think about how many to draw.

473
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I got it.

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll do that.

475
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Two times minus two games.

476
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's Mr. Hose.

477
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I was fast.

478
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was fast.

479
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll ask you.

480
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's go.

481
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Two times minus three games.

482
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's very fast.

483
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I did it again.

484
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You.

485
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Not at all.

486
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Not at all.

487
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm doing this because it's a TV show.

488
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm going home if I do it at home.

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Thank you for your hard work.

490
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm going home if I do it at home.

491
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's have the next entertainer appear.

492
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Who is it?

493
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hello, I'm Blue Ready.

494
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm the prince of the first current HANRYU idol entertainer in history.

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm very angry.

496
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm very angry.

497
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm really sorry.

498
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I was angry when we met, but it's completely different.

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I've been looking forward to it.

502
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There's nothing behind him.

503
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He's a trainee.

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm Sano.

505
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm Sano.

506
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Nice to meet you.

507
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He's a trainee.

508
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He's a trainee.

509
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's been eight years since I've been an entertainer.

510
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What is the game that Blue Ready came up with?

511
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is the game I played when I went to Korea to work as a HANRYU idol.

512
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's hard for me to speak Korean, so I couldn't do it.

513
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
At first, I was having a lot of fun communicating with the locals.

514
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This is the game.

515
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a greeting game connected to the world.

516
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll tell you the rules.

517
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Can Sano explain the rules?

518
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's about it.

519
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm a trainee, so I'll tell you the rules.

520
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Does Sano have upper teeth?

521
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I have it.

522
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's coming out.

523
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What is it?

524
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll tell you a little bit.

525
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll tell you a little bit.

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a game that you play according to the rhythm.

527
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
First, tell me about the country and region.

528
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's a greeting that goes along with that.

529
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If it's Osaka, it's Maido.

530
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If it's Okinawa, it's Haisai.

531
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If it's Korea, it's Anyohaseyo.

532
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If it's America, it's Hello.

533
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If it's China, it's Nihao.

534
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
If it's Thailand, it's Sawadika.

535
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I've never heard of it before.

536
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll give you a hint.

537
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If you're stabbed by a young man,

538
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It doesn't matter who stabbed you.

539
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Everyone, please stand up and say,

540
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Please stand up and say,

541
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Please stand up and say,

542
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Please stand up and say,

543
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If you don't say this, you're out.

544
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll give you a little bit of an example.

545
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
First of all, a successful example.

546
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Greeting game.

547
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Korea.

548
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Anyohaseyo.

549
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Korea.

550
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Anyohaseyo.

551
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is a problem.

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a wrong pattern.

553
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Greeting game.

554
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Korea.

555
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Sawadika.

556
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is a wrong pattern.

557
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is a wrong pattern.

558
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sano's way of getting up is unusual.

559
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What's wrong, Sano?

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Sano's way of getting up is unusual.

561
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Is that how you do it?

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm not nervous at all.

563
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Are you ready for YOKARUBI?

564
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's YOKARUBI.

565
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's YOKARUBI.

566
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Here we go.

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's connect to the world from the prince.

568
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Greeting game.

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

570
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
One, two, three.

571
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Osaka.

572
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Maido.

573
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
America.

574
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hello.

575
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
China.

576
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Nihao.

577
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Korea.

580
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Anyohaseyo.

581
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
China.

582
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's a little wrong.

583
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's a little wrong.

584
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's a wrong pattern.

585
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's a wrong pattern that doesn't get excited.

586
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm very sorry.

587
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Just say it.

588
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you're going to fall, just fall.

589
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I thought you were going to fall.

590
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I was nervous.

591
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was nervous, so I calmed down.

592
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Here we go.

593
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's connect to the world from the prince.

594
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Greeting game.

595
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah.

Sawadee krap.

605
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Thai.

606
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Wakamono.

607
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000

Sawadee krap.

615
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What's wrong with Sawadee krap?

616
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's too bright.

617
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's the other way around.

618
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000

619
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000

He is also moved by the moment.

623
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm about to cry.

Here it comes.

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
