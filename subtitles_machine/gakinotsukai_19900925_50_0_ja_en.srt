1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is the first episode of Chikichiki Beach Ballein Okinawa!

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
So you're wearing your newest swimsuit.

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
I've always wanted to see this.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's not sold anywhere.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
It's not sold anywhere anymore.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
This is a swimsuit from 3 years later.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh really?

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,000
It's pre-recorded, right?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's pre-recorded.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's pre-recorded.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's like this.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is the bottom.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I think this is a little big.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is necessary.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's the back like?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The back is like this.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The back is like this.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll do my best today.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a beach ballein in Okinawa.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There are two beach balleins.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not a skater, but I'll do it with everyone.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
First of all, Team Zero.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's always a prelude to our program.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I've been doing it for about a year.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Team Zero has been here since the first time.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's the first time I've been on the show.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if it's only men.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's Okinawa.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There are two gyaru.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Here you go.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
These two are going to be separated.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's do it together.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's do it together.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All right.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't see it in the sand.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Everyone's in the sand.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm just kidding.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Is that okay, referee?

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Isn't that four times?

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a double dribble.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you hear that?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is that okay?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a double dribble.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's safe.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You just had a great chance.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll show you.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll show you.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll show you.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm scared.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm scared.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm scared.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm scared.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm scared.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm scared.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm scared.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm scared.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can see the next one well.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's amazing.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's been a week since I came to Okinawa.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not that tanned.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you like Okinawa?

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Basically.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
To be honest.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't hate it.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But where do you like the most in Japan?

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Osaka.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Osaka is the best.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Where I am.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're not where you are.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's where I was born.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To be honest.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sad.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why?

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought you'd be a Osaka person until you die.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm a Osaka person.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm talking like a Osaka person.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm talking.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My wife is a woman from Tokyo.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not talking about Osaka.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm talking about how I was betrayed by you.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You've been living in Tokyo all this time.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But the child you're going to have.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What the hell are you talking about?

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm looking forward to this.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Have you thought of a name?

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not at all.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Next year.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I haven't thought of a name yet.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Ryukyu.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You guys.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't call Okinawa Chinan.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Since I came.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't call Chinan.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ryukyu-chan is cute.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's not cute.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why?

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's not cute.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ryukyu-chan is cute.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Everyone calls you Kyu-chan Kyu-chan.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What do you like?

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What do you like?

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, Japan is big.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I think my second hometown is Okinawa.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can say it wherever you go.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If I get married.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'd like to go to Okinawa.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You said it when you were in Hokkaido.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Hokkaido?

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why are you angry?

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They have a bad temper.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't think about it.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't care if you don't think about it.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't care if you don't think about it.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
After all, Okinawa is Okinawa.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why Okinawa?

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
After all, women from other countries are very hot.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've heard of it somewhere.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're still wearing it.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No, it's true.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Have you been to the moon?

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've been to the moon.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
With a woman from the south.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I've heard of it somewhere.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, a woman from the south.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I've been to the Philippines.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're going too far.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't go too far.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're going too far.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But what about Okinawan women?

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okinawa is a country.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, it's a country.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is it developing?

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What?

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The life.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What about it?

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The life.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know if I'll stay in a hotel tonight or go out.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What about it?

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Is it developing?

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You don't have to ask me that.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What about it?

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What about it?

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't have to ask me that.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What do you mean?

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There are various things depending on the land.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Depending on the land?

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Depending on the land.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Osaka is a pretty big city.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The women are pretty...

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They're pretty lively.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They're pretty lively.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's the meaning.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I know that.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And, um...

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I heard that the women in Nagoya are pretty light.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's your specialty.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What?

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've been to Nagoya.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I've been to a fashion massage.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You haven't been.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's here?

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What's here?

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Fashion massage.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What?

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What?

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Which one?

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's one.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's one?

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know.

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I've been there.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's a Maihara Sako Gai.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What's that?

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Maihara Sako Gai.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's that?

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's Maihara?

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Maihara Sako Gai.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What about it?

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Maihara Sako Gai?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I've never heard of it before.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's Maihara Sako Gai?

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's like an ancient...

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A ruin or something.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is Maihara Sako Gai.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's like an air balloon.

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's Maihara Sako Gai?

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've heard of it.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I've heard of it.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've heard of it before, so I've come this far.

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We...

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's right.

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's strange.

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There's something like that in Okinawa.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In Okinawa?

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What is it really like?

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's sexual, right?

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
How long have you been a virgin?

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If I were a 15-year-old, I wouldn't say that.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In Osaka, I was in the first year of high school.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Really?

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was in the first or second year of high school.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is it fast?

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's slow.

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's slow.

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're good.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
By the way, how old are you?

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think you're even slower.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I see.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I wanted to know that.

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why?

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What's the point of knowing that and thinking about today's action?

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to know.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Where are you going?

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where are you going today?

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Maihara Sako Gai.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Sako Gai.

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't want to say that, but I want to go to a disco.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Really?

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to go with Nori.

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can't go?

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You came here and...

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What?

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You came here and dressed like a gentleman.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't point your finger.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, I...

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I went to play with you while you were sleeping.

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What kind of play?

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You were healthy.

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You...

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't point your finger.

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You...

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's not it.

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're asking me.

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's right.

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're thinking about something sexy today.

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I won't let you say that you're not thinking.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You said there was nothing.

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're the one who made it out of nothing.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There must be something you're thinking about.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm not thinking.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Everyone is wondering what to do today.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Really?

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Then don't wear underwear until you get back to Okinawa.

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll take a bath.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's a weird bath.

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What is that?

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What?

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What are you doing?

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm thinking about something.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm thinking about what to do after this.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There's nothing?

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There's nothing.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I've been asking you about it.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Leave that aside.

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why should I leave it aside?

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I want to ask you that.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you going or not?

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not going.

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're in a hurry.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You have 15 minutes.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not going.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're not going.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
How many years have I taken you?

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How many years have I gone?

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you going or not?

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm not going.

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not going.

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm not going.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're not going either.

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't lie to me.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't want to meet you there.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can't meet you because I can't go.

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't meet you because I can't go.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't meet you because I can't go.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I can't meet you because I can't go.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think you want to go because you're so determined.

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you want to go?

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't want to go at all.

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're not going, are you?

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

293
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're not going, are you?

294
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm not going.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm not going either.

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What are you doing?

297
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What kind of person are you?

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What are you doing?

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hello.

300
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hello.

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What's your name?

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm Sueyoshi.

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sueyoshi.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Your voice is low.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm Sueyoshi.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How old are you?

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm 23.

308
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What were you?

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I was an instructor of jet skiing.

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't you have a title?

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't have a title.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The queen appeared in the first round.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't have a title.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're just an older sister.

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm just an older sister.

316
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're an instructor of jet skiing.

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Thank you very much.

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Good luck.

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Thank you very much.

321
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's great.

322
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll do my best.

323
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A long time ago, Matsumoto was working part-time at a bar.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
One of the two stayed there with his mother until late at night.

325
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When he finished his work and was about to go home, his mother approached him and was about to be attacked.

326
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Who did that?

327
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Please tell me.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Did you get attacked?

329
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He was working part-time at a snack bar.

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
His mother was like...

331
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In a good way, she was like Pigmon.

332
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What do you mean by good way?

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're crazy.

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're like Pigmon.

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Pigmon...

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Jamila?

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
She was a good person.

338
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
She was a good person, but she was scary.

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Her makeup was flashy.

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We were always together.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If we couldn't go home by the end of the day,

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the two of us would stay at my mother's place.

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But he was on vacation.

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He was on vacation.

346
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was the only one who could go home.

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We were late for the end of the day.

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The two of us would stay at my mother's place,

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but my mother was like,

350
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You can go home by yourself.

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Come on, come on.

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She was getting more and more scary.

353
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She was like, I won't do anything.

354
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So we stayed there.

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
At around 3 o'clock in the morning,

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I opened my eyes.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She was like,

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're so scary.

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're so scary.

360
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
She was like,

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're so scary.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
She was like,

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Stop it.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
She was like Hongo Takeshi before he was remodeled.

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Stop it.

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're so scary.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The child I gave birth to at that time was this one.

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I think there are people who are chasing you wherever you go.

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What do you think about them?

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Please give me some advice for what to do next.

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I think I know why you're a stroller.

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Your next job.

373
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's amazing.

374
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We know things that we don't know.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're worse than a detective.

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's true.

377
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your shoes are like Marco's shoes.

378
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's amazing.

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There are a lot of good and bad things.

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The good thing is the car.

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I went to the scene to get a car.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I couldn't stop it.

383
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I opened the space and stood up.

384
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was like this.

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was like the old man at the parking lot.

386
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's true.

387
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And when I was in pain, they fixed it for me.

388
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How did they fix it for you?

389
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't know.

390
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't think there's anyone in Okinawa who wants to chase you.

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If you give advice to someone who's chasing you, don't chase them too far.

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't overtake them.

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You're good.

394
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If they notice you, tell them you went first.

395
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There are people who go first when they notice me.

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There are people like that.

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You don't know if there's a lot of cars around you.

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
If you go like this, you'll get hit.

399
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You'll get hit.

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But still...

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll do my best!

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll do my best!

403
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And there are times when you're in bad shape because you're a girl.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's true.

405
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There are times when you get hit once a month.

406
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you're healthy every day.

407
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But you don't show it.

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You don't show it when you're in bad shape.

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So when I'm in the car, I'll be like,

410
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Grandma!

411
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll take a break.

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll take a break.

413
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm happy about that.

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm happy about that.

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm unhappy about that.

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Next.

417
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Good evening.

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I have a question.

419
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Machan is in a certain show.

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This must be about Yutomo.

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He's very quiet.

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He walks very quietly.

423
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And he's dressed up.

424
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He's wearing a black bra.

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What do you think you are?

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Applause!

427
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When you're on TV and talking to Hama-chan, you look very cheerful and happy.

428
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But who is the real Machan?

429
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Do you hate your fans?

430
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Or do you have some deep worries?

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think it's a very stupid question, but please tell us.

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll tell you.

433
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This was the same when I came in today.

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It was scary?

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes, it was.

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
He said it was scary.

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What's scary?

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
His face.

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
His face?

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It doesn't matter.

441
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's always because he's hot.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You came here by car today, right?

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes.

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What did you look like when you got off the car?

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I had a smile on my face.

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I see.

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Even the fans said,

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Matsumoto-san, please take this.

449
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm scared.

450
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm scared.

451
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It was scary.

452
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm scared.

453
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm sure you are.

454
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The other day, I said,

455
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Ah, this is Machan.

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And he said,

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Ah.

458
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He didn't say,

459
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Ah.

460
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He said,

461
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Thank you.

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Ah has a lot in it.

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He didn't say,

464
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Ah.

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He didn't say,

466
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Ah.

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He didn't say,

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Ah.

469
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Ah has a lot in it.

470
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Ah has a lot in it.

471
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Ah has a lot of gratitude.

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And,

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He's a sweet guy.

474
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Even if he was born,

475
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You wouldn't know it.

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Ah says,

477
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank you,

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And he's a sweet guy.

479
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You wouldn't know it.

480
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You're laughing.

481
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You should have a smile on your face.

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
When I got off the car today,

483
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I said,

484
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm scared.

485
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And when the door opened,

486
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I said,

487
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm scared.

488
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're kidding, right?

489
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You're kidding.

490
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think I said,

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm scared,

492
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
because I felt bad.

493
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was laughing.

494
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But everyone thinks so.

495
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What should I do?

496
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You should think of something fun while walking.

497
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If I think of something fun for me,

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll do it.

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's the face you're thinking of.

500
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's the face you're thinking of.

501
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't need a face.

502
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So I'll just do a little bit.

503
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Action?

504
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's right.

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
A face is normal.

506
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Even this.

507
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Look at it once.

508
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You won't know if it's good or bad.

509
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What?

510
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So,

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes.

512
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We're back at the store.

513
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Today,

514
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We did a beach ballet.

515
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
We did.

516
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We did jet skiing.

517
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And,

518
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What else?

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Marine jet.

520
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We did that.

521
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes.

522
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We rode a lot.

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But,

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
My latest swimsuit was amazing.

525
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It was amazing.

526
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That was perfect.

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It was a little dangerous.

528
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I tried not to imitate the kids watching TV.

529
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But,

530
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You didn't sell that, did you?

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No, I didn't.

532
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Really?

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You wore that and went to the beach.

534
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes.

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In my memory,

536
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I and Gunji Kawamata were on TV.

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Kawamata's was a little older.

538
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No, no, no.

539
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It was a big one.

540
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

541
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I want to go to other places on this show.

542
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I want to.

543
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

544
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Well,

545
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll be back in Tokyo next week.

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll be back in Tokyo.

547
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I want to do it.

548
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yes.

549
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll be your assistant.

550
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
All of them are the same.

551
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll be waiting for you.

552
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So,

553
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The Okinawa version of the Karaen.

554
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This is the end of this week.

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
See you next week.

556
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Good bye.
