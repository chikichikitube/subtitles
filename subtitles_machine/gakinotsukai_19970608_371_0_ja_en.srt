1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Gaki no Tsukai's famous project, Hichihenge.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,400
A bold idea, a secret acting, and the power to read the atmosphere.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,880
The challenger will use all of these powers to transform into the 7 main characters.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,480
It's a serious battle that will make the audience laugh.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,440
The challenger this time is this man, director Otomo.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,400
The first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikizuki!

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:31,000
Director Otomo Yuji, Hichihenge!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,320
To be honest, we always decide on the opening act after it's over.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,520
The challenger was in a hurry because he had to go to the bathroom.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm about to cry.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,640
Otomo, please.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Here you go, Otomo.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,640
This is the record for money.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
The winner is Isomata.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Isomata is the winner.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,080
How confident are you?

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,040
Well, I've been laughing a lot.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:23,320
Who's laughing?

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,200
Here's the opening act.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,560
What's this?

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,280
Writer Takasuke Otako.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,120
I've been here before, but he's moved.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,000
This is easy to do.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,840
There's about 30 stories, so I can't go crazy.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,760
This is amazing.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,320
How about Kokoriko?

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:59,040
Maybe Tanaka can use it.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,400
There's a lot of reaction.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,840
If you look at it like that, I'm done too.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,640
All the staff are involved in this, right?

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,240
That's right.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,920
I think it's better to hold back the loss here.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,400
There was a scene in Isawa, right?

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,480
If you shake the camera at Yamazaki, it'll fall.

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,640
Really?

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:41,440
What should I do?

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
Yamazaki, right?

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:54,840
Not yet.

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Not yet?

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,480
No, it's my turn.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,720
No, I don't know.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,080
It's okay.

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Did you see my feet?

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,440
I saw it.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,080
I was laughing at my feet.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
Speed skating.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,600
I was wondering what I was doing at first.

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,480
I was waiting for my turn.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
You're moving to Yamazaki, right?

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
I want to move.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,560
I heard you're looking for a house.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,400
You're looking for a house, right?

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,320
You're looking for a house, right?

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm looking for a house, but I'm looking for a house.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm moved.

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm moved.

57
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,280
Thank you very much.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,960
How many times have you seen it?

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm moved.

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,760
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm moved.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,320
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,760
That's what it is.

64
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,880
What should I say?

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,000
You can go to Kokoriko.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,080
It's like you went to Yamazaki.

67
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,360
Next, I'm going to Shinohara.

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
You're going to Yamazaki, right?

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm going to Kurukuru.

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm going to Merhe.

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm going to Shinohara.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
You're fast.

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,920
But you're going to sleep in that.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm going to sleep in that.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:05,920
What should I do?

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,920
What should I do if I get kicked out?

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:23,920
What should I do if I get kicked out?

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,520
What should I do if I get kicked out?

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:41,520
What should I do if I get kicked out?

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
What should I do if I get kicked out?

81
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,520
I have no choice but to get kicked out.

82
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
You're so persistent.

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,520
I didn't think you'd be so worried about it.

84
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Why aren't you getting married?

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I want to get married.

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm getting older.

87
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,520
I'm getting older.

88
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Kurukuru.

89
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm getting older.

90
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:45,520
I'm getting older.

91
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:58,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

92
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:14,520
Where do you live?

93
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Where do you live?

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Where do you live?

95
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
You're too young!

96
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Hey!

97
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Why did you choose this?

98
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

99
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

100
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
I don't know either.

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
How was it?

102
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
7, 8, 9, 29,000

103
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
You're the best!

104
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
You were dancing at the top.

105
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:42,520
I can say this now, but it was a little cold in Shinohara.

106
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,520
We're going to have another talk with the players.

107
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
It's the second time today.

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
It's been a while.

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
There's one more thing.

110
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
It's going up.

111
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
First of all,

113
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
What?

114
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,520
You said you were a crazy talent, right?

115
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Yes.

116
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,520
When you said you wanted to use Toshio Matsumoto for a commercial,

117
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Yes.

118
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,520
You said you couldn't do it because of the schedule.

119
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
The next one to come is...

120
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,520
The last one is Katsura.

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,520
If I can't do it, I'll be the second one to come to the top.

122
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Really?

123
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
You're not what I thought you were.

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
You're not what I thought you were.

125
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
You're not what I thought you were.

126
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
You're not what I thought you were.

127
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
You're not what I thought you were.

128
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
You know what I mean, right?

129
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Who's the one who said B?

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,520
If I had to add one more thing to this,

131
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I think I should add a similar animal.

132
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm definitely a leopard.

133
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
It doesn't matter.

134
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
It doesn't matter.

135
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
A leopard, right?

136
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Isn't that right?

137
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
You're like...

138
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,520
You're like Ayu, right?

139
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Are you really saying what you think?

140
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Do I look like Ayu?

141
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Ayu or something like that.

142
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
It's not like that.

143
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
The sport I can't go to is...

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Basketball.

145
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
What's that?

146
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
If you're that tall, you'll win.

147
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Little by little,

148
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
When basketball started,

149
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Now everyone's in a different mood.

150
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Now everyone's in a different mood.

151
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
So if it's about five meters long,

152
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Everyone has the same conditions.

153
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
You don't have the same conditions.

154
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
It's not like you can grab a bank and say,

155
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
You can't grab a bank and say,

156
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
At that point,

157
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,520
What's that?

158
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
There's a lot of such things, so it's fun.

159
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Small games like that are fun.

160
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Everyone shakes it like this.

161
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
It's fun.

162
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
It's fun because you're gonna jump in and kick it.

163
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
It's funny because you can't stop it.

164
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Why? The little one is so desperate.

165
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Don't be so f*****g stupid.

166
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
You're f*****g stupid.

167
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
You're f*****g stupid.

168
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Don't explain it.

169
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
You don't need to explain it.

170
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
You're f*****g stupid.

171
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
You're f*****g stupid.

172
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
It's funny.

173
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I just did it.

174
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Then, I want to decide.

175
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
What?

176
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
I want to decide.

177
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
I thought it was here.

178
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
I thought it was here.

179
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
I want to decide.

180
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Then, please take it.

181
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
It's here.

182
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
You can't say that.

183
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
You're f*****g stupid.

184
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
You're f*****g stupid.

185
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
How can I make you laugh?

186
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
You're f*****g stupid.

187
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
I don't want to make you laugh here.

188
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
How can I make you laugh?

189
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
I want to see your f*****g face.

190
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
It's difficult to make you laugh here.

191
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
It's difficult to make you laugh here.

192
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
I'll make you laugh here.

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I'll make you laugh here.

194
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
This is difficult.

195
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
What is this?

196
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Say something.

197
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Say something.

198
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Say something.

199
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
I can't do it.

200
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
I can't do it.

201
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
I can't do it.

202
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
I can't do it.

203
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I can't do it.

204
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
I can't do it.

205
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
What do you want to do now?

206
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Battle Royale.

207
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Battle Royale.

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Battle Royale.

209
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I've said it many times.

210
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm getting anxious.

211
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I wonder if there was such a thing.

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Battle Royale.

213
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
It seems fun.

214
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
It's not fun.

215
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
But if it's 4 people, 4 people.

216
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
If it's 4 people, 5 people.

217
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
While one person is fighting,

218
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
the other person is like this.

219
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
There are other people who can talk.

220
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
I can't do it.

221
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I can't do it.

222
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
I feel like it's fun.

223
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I feel like it's a party.

224
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
First of all, come and see.

225
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I'll film the front.

226
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
It's more fun.

227
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
When is it? Battle Royale.

228
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
That's right.

229
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
This year.

230
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
There are 3 people.

231
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Yes, I do.

232
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Is someone coming?

233
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I've already decided.

234
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Oh, really?

235
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Yes.

236
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Well, I definitely want to do Sasuke.

237
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I have Sasuke.

238
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
What about the others?

239
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Well, I have a few others.

240
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
You don't have any?

241
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Well, I'll hold down the seat.

242
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Well, take my hand.

243
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm begging you!

244
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm really begging you!

245
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Where are you holding down?

246
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Matsumoto-san, you've been riding on the backs of many beasts since you were a child.

247
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,520
What is the animal that took the longest time to ride on your back?

248
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Ah...

249
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Wait, let me ask you first.

250
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes.

251
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
What kind of animal have you ridden on?

252
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Well, when I was a child, I rode on a rhino.

253
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,520
What did I ride on before that?

254
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
I don't have a picture of that time, so I don't know.

255
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
You don't remember anything other than a rhino, do you?

256
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I remember. When I was a child, I rode on a rhino.

257
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
So you remember what happened after that?

258
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
I remember what happened after that.

259
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,520
What are you talking about? Are you angry?

260
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Are you crying?

261
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Who's crying?

262
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
I'm angry.

263
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
So you started riding on a rhino.

264
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
My life.

265
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
When I was a child, I rode on a rhino.

266
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
You rode on a rhino.

267
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
I don't remember that.

268
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
But I've been riding on a rhino since I was a child.

269
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, you've been riding on a rhino since you were a child?

270
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Do you remember?

271
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
No, I don't.

272
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
I remember riding on a rhino.

273
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You remember riding on a rhino.

274
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I remember riding on a rhino.

275
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,520
That's what I'm saying.

276
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Why are you so excited?

277
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,520
I remember riding on a rhino.

278
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I remember riding on a rhino.

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
You said, let's go from there.

280
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,520
It's not riding on a rhino, it's riding on a rhino.

281
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I don't understand that.

282
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
I don't like it.

283
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
It's over a rhino.

284
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm a rhino.

285
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm a rhino.

286
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I don't remember riding on a rhino at all.

287
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,520
You don't know the difference between a rhino and a rhino.

288
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
This is a baby.

289
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Baby.

290
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Baby.

291
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Baby rhino.

292
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I said rhino.

293
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Baby.

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Baby rhino.

295
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Baby rhino.

296
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
But this has a soul.

297
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
It's a rhino.

298
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
It's a rhino.

299
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Tell me from here.

300
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
What did you ride on from here?

301
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
That's what I'm saying.

302
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
How many have a soul?

303
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Well...

304
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
18.

305
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:25,520
18?

306
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,520
It's okay, it's 18.

307
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Tell me after 18.

308
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I rode on a rhino until I was 20 years old.

309
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
What did you change?

310
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,520
I don't know what to change.

311
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I don't know how many years I've been riding on a rhino.

312
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I'll tell you simply.

313
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I've been riding on a rhino for two years, and I've been riding on a rhino for seven years.

314
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
What?

315
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,520
I don't have the feeling of being on a rhino.

316
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
At first, you were going wild.

317
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,520
I was riding on a rhino, and he was riding on a rhino, too.

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,520
There was a fight between me and the rhino.

319
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
There was.

320
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
He was doing this on purpose.

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
But you were falling.

322
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Who's going to fall?

323
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I see.

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
It was a great feeling.

325
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Yes.

326
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,520
It was a great unit.

327
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,520
You're going to ride on a rhino anyway, aren't you?

328
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
I was waiting at the front door in the morning.

329
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I really wanted to change that.

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
I didn't like it.

331
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I understand that.

332
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
I had an affair.

333
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Who?

334
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
You?

335
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
I had an affair with a rhino, too.

336
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Both of you?

337
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
I had an affair with a rhino, too.

338
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
I said, let's stop.

339
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,520
When I asked the rhino, he said, I have someone else I want to ride on.

340
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
That's a good thing.

341
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I understand that.

342
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
What did you ride on after that?

343
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Then there was a new rhino.

344
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
A rhino?

345
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
It was a completely different rhino.

346
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I rode on it for about half a year.

347
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
When it came to me, I was tired.

348
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
The previous one.

349
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,520
He was looking at me.

350
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I thought it was a bad habit of the previous one.

351
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Is it hard to ride on a tiger or a lion?

352
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
It's hard to ride on that.

353
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
But you rode on it, didn't you?

354
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I rode on it.

355
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
That's amazing.

356
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,520
For example, how long did it take you to ride on a rhino?

357
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Two months.

358
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
But it took two months.

359
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,520
It took half a year to ride on a lion.

360
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
That's a long time.

361
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,520
I think I'll get in trouble if I get a letter.

362
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
You'll get in trouble.

363
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,520
At that time, I thought I shouldn't get a letter.

364
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
At that time, I thought I shouldn't get a letter.

365
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
It's hard to ride on a lion.

366
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I was told that I shouldn't get a letter.

367
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Is it okay?

368
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
It's a movie if you like it.

369
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Are you angry?

370
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Are you angry?

371
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
I don't know how it is.

372
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
It's a movie.

373
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
It took half a year.

374
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,520
How long did it take you to ride on a lion?

375
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,520
It took more time than I thought when I rode on a lion.

376
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
It took more time than I thought when I rode on a lion.

377
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I'll tell you the truth.

378
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,520
I rode on a lion smoothly.

379
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I see.

380
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
But it's not impossible.

381
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I'll tell you the story.

382
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I'll tell you the story.

383
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Amaryllis.

384
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,520
When I'm in the dressing room, I always...

385
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,520
When I'm in the dressing room, I always massage your tired body.

386
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

387
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Please tell me the true identity of cataclysm.

388
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Do you know what cataclysm is?

389
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Originally, it was called catacorins.

390
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm saying it in a short way.

391
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Catacorins are cataclysm.

392
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Catacorins are catacorins.

393
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
What?

394
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
It's strange.

395
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
It's strange.

396
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I don't know.

397
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I don't know.

398
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I don't know.

399
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
But you know the true identity of cataclysm, right?

400
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Of course I know.

401
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
Please tell me.

402
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:47,520
In the end, cataclysm is not a good thing.

403
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
That's why it's called catacorins.

404
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
That's why it's called catacorins.

405
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Everyone doesn't know.

406
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
I don't know.

407
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Why?

408
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
It's not catacorins.

409
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
It's not catacorins.

410
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
You're making a great discovery.

411
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,520
How to cure catacorins.

412
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,520
I'm going to tell you how to get rid of catacorins.

413
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Who discovered it?

414
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
How much?

415
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I'm saying that.

416
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Really?

417
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,520
First of all, I have to think that I can't do it.

418
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
I see.

419
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
You can't do it.

420
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
I see.

421
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
That's why.

422
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
There's a difference between you and me.

423
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I see.

424
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,520
You might get angry if I say this.

425
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
Well, you won't get angry.

426
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
But you might get angry.

427
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
What?

428
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Everyone doesn't know.

429
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Then let's say it.

430
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Catacorins have a stupid face.

431
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,520
You have a stupid face.

432
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,520
You have a stupid face now.

433
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,520
You wake up early every morning and do a two-hour fitness on the balcony.

434
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Mr. Matsumoto with a sexy body.

435
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Yes.

436
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I haven't pooped for two weeks.

437
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,520
It's a complete constipation.

438
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
What should I do?

439
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Let's say it in English.

440
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Say whatever you want.

441
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Just say it.

442
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Rilla.

443
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Rilla.

444
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Mr. Matsumoto is standing up.

445
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I think he can still do it.

446
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Trust me.

447
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Are you okay?

448
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
If you think you can't do it, you'll fall down right away.

449
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Human beings are always a little bit powerful.

450
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
At any time.

451
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I see.

452
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Even if you tell me to relax my body, I'm sure it's somewhere.

453
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Yes.

454
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
By releasing that power,

455
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I can poop as much as I want.

456
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I see.

457
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,520
But the power of the body is opening pores.

458
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
It's opening all the pores.

459
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
It's getting a little bigger.

460
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,520
All the pores are getting bigger.

461
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
The body is getting a little bigger.

462
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
It's getting a little bigger.

463
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
All the pores are opening.

464
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Then it's already dry.

465
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
My body and my eyes are all broken.

466
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Well, you're right.

467
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:31,520
You should have stopped me.

468
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,520
You should have stopped me at that time.

469
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
What should I say?

470
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,520
I want you to stop me even if you hit me.

471
00:23:41,520 --> 00:24:02,520
