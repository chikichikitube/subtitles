1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Yakinokukai's famous Prank-Zen-Shu!

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Today, we'll show you a super-duper-VTR of Machanama-chan's Prank-Zen-Shu,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
and also a super-duper-VTR of Ahozura Manakuzero!

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Prank-Zen-Shu

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Target No.1

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
The first target of the memorable prank was Hama-chan.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm not Matsumoto!

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
This is my first time doing this, so I'm here today.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Ramen and...

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
The bento is terrible!

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
I've never eaten bento like this before.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Here it comes.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
This is the first time I've been this nervous.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Thank you for the food.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
The second target of the memorable Prank-Zen-Shu was Hama-chan.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Grandma!

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Grandma!

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Grandma!

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Don't drink the water!

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
No!

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
No!

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
My body!

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
No!

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
No!

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
What the hell are you doing?

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Hama-chan!

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
What the hell are you doing?

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Why did you come here earlier than me?

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
No!

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
What time did I wake you up?

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I came here earlier than you!

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I've been in that cold place all this time!

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Target No.2

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
The first prank was Chikichiki-Terekura!

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
The next target was Takasu, the writer.

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
The man's desire was completely crushed.

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
If you really make a promise, will it come true?

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I can feel it in your skin.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
This is different from the usual opening.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
The staff is like a tracking staff.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Please go!

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Actually, this monitor...

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Takasu, the writer, is in Room No.4.

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
That room is being shown now.

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Because he likes sauce.

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I think Takasu will keep it a secret from us.

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I see.

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
That's why I asked the tracking staff to come here today.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I bought it.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I bought it.

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
It's Aoyako.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Where are you?

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Where do you live?

54
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm in Otsuka.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Otsuka?

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Yes.

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Really?

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
What are you doing now?

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm taking a day off from work today.

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I don't have much time, so I'm calling you.

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Really?

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Do you call often?

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I don't call that often.

64
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I've heard a lot of things.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Do you talk to everyone?

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm in Otsuka.

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Minamiguchi.

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Minamiguchi?

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes.

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I understand.

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Really?

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Yes.

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm in Otsuka.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Really?

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Pink suit. Minamiguchi.

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Minamiguchi.

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Takasu is all alone.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
That guy?

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm still working hard.

81
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Who do you look like?

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
You're so cool.

83
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Who are you?

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
You're so cool.

85
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Who are you?

86
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Taishu Kase.

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm serious.

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Do you really look like him?

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't think so.

91
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Taishu Kase?

92
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
I'm grateful that you call me.

93
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Let's meet somewhere at 10 o'clock.

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
At 8 o'clock?

95
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
If you don't, I'll call you.

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Taishu Kase?

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I see.

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I'd like to meet you.

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Of course.

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
By the way, you might think it's a lie.

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I used to be a fan of you.

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
What?

103
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
By the way, I...

104
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Well...

105
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I can't meet you at 10 o'clock.

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It's okay.

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Do you know where the station is at 10 o'clock?

108
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Yes.

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
What are you going to wear?

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I'm going to wear a white polo shirt and a navy skirt.

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Takasu is excited.

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Navy skirt.

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
You're going to wear it, right?

114
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm going to wear it.

115
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
You have to come.

116
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Yes.

117
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm waiting for you.

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
All right.

119
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Let's report the results of the one-person test.

120
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm 20 years old.

121
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
How many tests did you take?

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I took three tests.

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Only one?

124
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
At 8 o'clock.

125
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm here.

126
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
How did you do it?

127
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Only one.

128
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
There are only two.

129
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Welcome home.

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Welcome home.

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
What about you, Takasu?

132
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I didn't have time.

133
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I didn't have time.

134
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
I see.

135
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
It can't be helped.

136
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Thank you for your hard work.

137
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
He's here.

138
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
He's here.

139
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
He's here.

140
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
He's here.

141
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
He's here.

142
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
He's here.

143
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
He's here.

144
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
He's here.

145
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
You're singing with someone you know.

146
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm desperate to find you.

147
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm waiting for you.

148
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I'm waiting for you.

149
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I'm waiting for you.

150
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
You look like Tsukosu.

151
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I look like Tsukosu.

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
You're stupid.

153
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
You're waiting for me.

154
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
You're stupid.

155
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
You're stupid.

156
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
You're stupid.

157
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
You're stupid.

158
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I'm not stupid.

159
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm going to expand the strike zone of Toshio.

160
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I wonder if he's going to come out.

161
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I wonder if he's going to come out.

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
That's amazing.

163
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm asking you.

164
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm asking you.

165
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm not going to pull you any further.

166
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I wonder if he's going to come out.

167
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
I wonder if he's going to come out.

168
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I'm not stupid.

169
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm going to look over there.

170
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Which way?

171
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
I'm going to look over there.

172
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
That's not it.

173
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Let's wait a little longer.

174
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Takahashi.

175
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's wait a little longer.

176
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Let's wait a little longer.

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Let's wait a little longer.

178
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:32,500
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,500
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:39,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,500
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:47,500
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm here.

184
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I'm here.

185
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
He's running away.

186
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
He's running away.

187
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:11,500
He's running away.

188
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
That's definitely it.

189
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Let's wait a little longer.

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
What's wrong?

191
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
What's wrong, Takahashi?

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Takahashi.

193
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Takahashi.

194
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Takahashi.

195
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
You've been silent all this time.

196
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Takahashi.

198
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Takahashi.

199
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Takahashi, who was silent to everyone.

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Let's not do this.

201
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
This is not funny.

202
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Target number 3.

203
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Next is Yamazaki.

204
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Here's where the bad comedian comes in.

205
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
This is Takasu.

206
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Actually, this time, Takasu.

207
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
He lent me his room.

208
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Yamazaki.

209
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
With his girlfriend.

210
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I want to get on with you.

211
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I want to get on with you.

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Actually, that girl.

213
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
She was this woman.

214
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
First of all, please play her role.

215
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
What's your name?

216
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm Asaki Misato.

217
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm Asaki Misato.

218
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Actually, Takasu.

219
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm Yamazaki.

220
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm Yamazaki.

221
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm Yamazaki.

222
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
That's my room.

223
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
To her.

224
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
That's my room.

225
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
So I'm Yamazaki.

226
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm Yamazaki.

227
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Yamazaki is back while I'm running.

228
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
And she's gone.

229
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
And she's gone.

230
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
And then.

231
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
And then.

232
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
This man will appear.

233
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Please.

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
It doesn't look like elementary school students.

235
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm Murakami, the villain introduction.

236
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
When I was defeated.

237
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I wonder if Yamazaki will blow the night wind.

238
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
It's coming.

239
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
It's coming.

240
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:29,500
It's coming.

241
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Good morning.

242
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
It's cool, isn't it?

243
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
It's cool, isn't it?

244
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,500
It's cool, isn't it?

245
00:12:44,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Yamazaki-san.

246
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Hello.

247
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Hello.

248
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Hello.

249
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Hello.

250
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Hello.

251
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Hello.

252
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Is Yamazaki here?

253
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
It's me.

254
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
It's me.

255
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Hey.

256
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
You.

257
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Misato.

258
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I'll give you a joker.

259
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Hey.

260
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Who is Misato?

261
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Don't say that.

262
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Don't say that.

263
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Don't say that.

264
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Hey.

265
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Hey.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey.

267
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Hey.

268
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Say something.

269
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Hey.

270
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Hey.

271
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Hey.

272
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Hey.

273
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Hey.

274
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Hey.

275
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Hey.

276
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Hey.

277
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Hey.

278
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
It's too late, so hurry.

279
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
If you wait, it's there.

280
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Hey, wait.

281
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
It's not nice to say that.

282
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's not nice to say that.

283
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Hey.

284
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
It's not nice to say that.

285
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
It's too late, so hurry.

286
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
In early-night.

287
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
We don't Pierrot.

288
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
It's one of us.

289
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
It's one of us.

290
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Hey.

291
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Hey.

292
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Wait.

293
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Hey.

294
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Come on.

295
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Hey.

296
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
What is Misato.

297
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
It's cool.

298
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
It's cool.

299
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It's cool.

300
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
It's cool.

301
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
It's cool.

302
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
It's cool.

303
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
It's cool.

304
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
It's cool.

305
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
How is it?

306
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Do you know Misato?

307
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
From where?

308
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
This?

309
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I got a call.

310
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
From Murakami.

311
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
He said,

312
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Wait a minute.

313
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I'll be back in a minute.

314
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
That's right.

315
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
He said,

316
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Wait a minute.

317
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I don't know where he is.

318
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I don't know where he is.

319
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I don't know where he is.

320
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I don't know where he is.

321
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,500
It's the worst.

322
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I'll get it from here.

323
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Murakami.

324
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Hello.

325
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Hey, do you know Yamazaki?

326
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Yes.

327
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Yamazaki.

328
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Your name is Yamazaki.

329
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm Takasato.

330
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Get out of here.

331
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Yamazaki.

332
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
What do you mean?

333
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm coming, so wait for me.

334
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
I'll be there.

335
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I'll do it.

336
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You stay here.

337
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Excuse me.

338
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
You're scary.

339
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Don't do that.

340
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I don't know you.

341
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
I know you.

342
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Why didn't you tell me?

343
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm here.

344
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Who is it?

345
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I don't know you.

346
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I'll go from there.

347
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I'll go from there.

348
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I'll go from there.

349
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I'll go from here.

350
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I'll go from here.

351
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Excuse me.

352
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm not the one.

353
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
What the hell?

354
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm not the one.

355
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I'm not the one.

356
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Excuse me.

357
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
What the hell?

358
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm not the one.

359
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm really not.

360
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Why don't you tell me?

361
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I'm not the one.

362
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
He's talking crap.

364
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm not the one.

365
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Just wait for a second.

366
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Where is your life?

367
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
nanレ

368
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Konnichiwa!

369
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
You're wrong!

370
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

371
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
You're wrong!

372
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

373
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I thought I was going to die!

374
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Let's run away.

375
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Let's run away.

376
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Wow, that's huge!

377
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
When you called me, you said you were fine.

378
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm really tired.

379
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Target number 4.

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
In the first episode of the Gaki no Tsukai series,

381
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Chikichiki, Nakibokuro, and Okamoto

382
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
have a big surprise!

383
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Next, Okamoto, who was the new manager at the time.

384
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
First, let's introduce the two people behind the scenes.

385
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Kenji Tsugawa.

386
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
And next to him, the writer, Ichi Motoi.

387
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
The two of them are the set.

388
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
They're gay.

389
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
But this is a prank.

390
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,500
It's a prank to show Okamoto the gay part.

391
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
But the gay part is real.

392
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Okamoto, bring me some clothes.

393
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Hey, Ha, Ha, Ha.

394
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
LOL

395
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
I cannot believe

396
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,220
There are so many things

397
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
You are so beautiful

398
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Come to me

399
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Yama-chan

400
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
You don't know anything scary

401
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
I don't know anything scary

402
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,220
Yama-chan

403
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
You don't know anything scary

404
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
Yama-chan

405
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
You got it

406
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
I got it

407
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,220
I am quick

408
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
I know how to grill

409
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:37,220
Two are

410
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Two are

411
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,220
Two are

412
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,220
You are so black

413
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
The red color going on

414
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Yama-chan

415
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,140
And I came for a phone call.

416
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,180
Here's our little Curly figured out hero!

417
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:20,260
D

418
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,260
If you don't say anything, I'll go this way.

419
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Lower your head. I'm sorry.

420
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm sorry.

421
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:53,260
Otoichi is acting like that again.

422
00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:13,260
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
What are you doing, sensei?

424
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
That was a tough prank.

425
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:27,260
It's a scary town.

426
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,260
Target number 5.

427
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,260
The world's new record.

428
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,260
The last one is a prank that we rarely see.

429
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Please explain today's mission.

430
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
How many people can fit in here?

431
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
I see.

432
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Let's start the practice.

433
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:03,260
You have to close it.

434
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
It's open here.

435
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:11,260
It's delicious.

436
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,260
It's delicious there, too.

437
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
You have to work harder.

438
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Remember how you felt when you were thrown away by the coin locker.

439
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,260
Who?

440
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
I don't know.

441
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,260
You failed because you went from the big one.

442
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,260
You have to go lower.

443
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I'm scared.

444
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,260
You came here to do this?

445
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:06,260
I didn't have to kill you to trick you.

446
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:31,260
I'm scared.

447
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:46,260
I'm scared.

448
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,260
I don't like it.

449
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,260
I feel like I'm going to vomit.

450
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:05,260
I'm scared.

451
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:20,260
The smoke is strong.

452
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Yamazaki-san.

453
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,260
You guys are scary.

454
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,260
You guys are funny.

455
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Did you know that?

456
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Then...

457
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Don't blow your nose.

458
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Don't be fooled like this.

459
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Don't be fooled.
