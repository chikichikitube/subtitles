1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Kishinako no Yureru

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Kishinako no Yureru

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The love that sways and sways

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is a taxi driver

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Arashiya

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All right

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Maku

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All right

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's strange

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You don't really have to be surprised

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't have a boyfriend

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How old are you?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm 5 years old and 8 years old

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Have you been transferred to another school?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, I haven't

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We were together all the time

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We were together all the time

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We were together all the time

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We were together all the time

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We were together all the time

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was in the sixth grade at that time

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you double as a elementary school student?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm in my 40s

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But haven't you changed your body type?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Why?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's about this year

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My body type has changed

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It has changed

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It has changed

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How has it changed?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I used to be fatter

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've become slimmer

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You said a great thing about yourself

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I used to be really fat

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My hands are smooth now

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I used to be sticky

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can make a plastic model if you don't use glue

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's an exaggeration

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I've become slimmer

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's a good thing

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He's better off that way

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's better off that way

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's a good thing

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But when I get in the car, I smell like an old man

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What kind of smell is that?

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It smells like I got in a taxi a few years ago

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It smells like I got in a taxi a few years ago

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In the car?

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the car

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
When I get in the car, I feel sorry for the car

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's bitter

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But it's okay

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's how it is

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When I was in Heihei, you suddenly made me sing

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been thinking about it since then

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But I'm not good at singing

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't think so

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't think so at all

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think you're better than average

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But is it different?

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It was a little bad

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The other day

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You've gotten a little better

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Compared to before

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A little

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why is that?

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you getting used to it?

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Nakajime Miyuki

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What?

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll ask you as a representative

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Who is it?

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Nakajime Miyuki

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's Teisei

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's Teisei

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You don't know Nakajime Miyuki

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't laugh

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Listen to the last story

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Nakajime Miyuki's sister

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Nakajima Miyuki

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why is it a sister?

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a different name

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I know if it's a different name

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Which one is Nakajima?

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There is no Nakajima

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There is a person called Nakajima Miyuki

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What was that song?

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There is a song called a man has a man

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was a drama

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There was something

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't sing that song

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No matter how many times I sing

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It ends right after I sing

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There is a man has a man

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There is a home

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It ends

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is that wrong?

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is it wrong?

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's like it's wrong

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I want to start more

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Next time I have to go to a woman

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't sing that

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why is that?

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I understand

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There is a man has a man

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's strange

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't continue

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please fix me

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Please hit me

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You have to hit me

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't sing

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There is a man has a man

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
U2

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You don't know U2?

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know if it's a foreign song

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Arabesque

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's old

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think there are people who don't know Arabesque

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You don't know?

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why don't you know?

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're not interested?

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's old

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The picture is old

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is that so?

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's old

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's okay

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The distance between the audience and me is getting bigger

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you know that, it's a good story

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's strange

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't say that

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's talk about the mangrove

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That long story, Saiyuki

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I read it in just 10 minutes

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I heard that you can do a lot of things

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Please show me some of them

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I hate long stories

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I can talk about everything

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I always think that everything is fast

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For example, look over there

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hamada, you're slow

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look over there

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hamada, you're slow

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're slow

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why?

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're not looking over there

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm looking over there

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're not looking over there

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm looking over there

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hamada

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Tanaka

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's not Tanaka

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's not Tanaka

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's not Tanaka

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why are you looking at me?

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's not good

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll call him

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You'll call him?

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's fast

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's fast

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But before you call him, I want you to promise me something

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Call me Matsumoto

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're dirty

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yamamoto

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I want to see how fast it is

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why are you looking at me from the side?

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Turn around

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're so kind

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is this okay?

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Here I go

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're not saying anything

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm fast

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
2 plus 5 is?

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
7

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're slow

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I feel sorry for 7

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I feel sorry for 7

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
3 plus 4 is?

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
7

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have a question for Matsumoto

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please tell me the source of money for your partner Hamada

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What kind of person are you?

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm working

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm getting paid from Yoshimoto

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course that's right

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But this is my main job

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And you have a lot of clothes

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're saying interesting things

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not interesting

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What did you say?

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You don't show your bag

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What?

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't show what's in your bag

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't show it

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There's a lot of stuff in there

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a lot of stuff in there

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't say that

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't talk

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You're in a super car

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm not in a super car

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You're in a car like 007

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not in a super car

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you press a button, it will start

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What is this?

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's like cutting wood

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can't buy a car like that

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How much is it?

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's nothing

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let me touch it

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why would you touch it?

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's like marble

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not marble

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But it's like marble

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why?

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're in a super car

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not in a super car

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have two cars

229
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You have two cars?

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Two cars?

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you have two cars?

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't have one

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm barefoot

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're barefoot

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My feet are hard

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I run a lot

237
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have two cars

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have a high-speed car

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't have one

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you're that fast, you should have a car

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you're that fast, you should have a car

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
A high-speed guy told me

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
All the guys have this

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The guy you passed by happened to have a car

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Like this

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you make a mistake, it's fast

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's really fast

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I got caught in an office once

249
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I was called by the police

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a camera

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If you exceed the speed limit, it will flash

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It flashed

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was called by the police

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was last summer

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I said I didn't know

256
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I said I didn't know

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What kind of world has a high-speed car?

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why would it flash?

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It flashed

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was surprised

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The pendant was yellow

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My chest was wide open

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you wearing?

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's a bathrobe

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You went to the bathroom

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I had an accident

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What kind of accident?

268
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was protected

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You were in the shower

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was looking away

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I didn't know the car was stopped

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was fine

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
From behind

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I was drunk

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You were drunk

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You should have gone

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was in the car

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Nothing happened over there?

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was dark

280
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It was bad over there

281
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
From behind

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They said sorry

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I was like a junior high school student

284
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
A junior high school student flashed a high-speed car?

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't shine
