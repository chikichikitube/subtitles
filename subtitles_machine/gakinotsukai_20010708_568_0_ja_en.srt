00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I know how you feel, Kawagita.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is it?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't know.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I really don't know.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's been a while. How are you?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm good.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're good?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm fine.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's good.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What is it today?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today is finally far away.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Today is finally far away.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's really far away.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why did you come all the way here?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to throw up a lot.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you okay?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The other day, I was wondering if it was okay for something like that to happen.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Something that surprised me happened.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What is it?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is... What is it?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was pooping at home by myself.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry to talk about pooping all of a sudden, but I was pooping.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I was doing it like this.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Suddenly, I saw a huge cockroach on the wall.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's scary, isn't it?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was here.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If I go like this, the cockroach will go like this.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's right.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think it will do something.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think it will do something.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Even animals can feel it.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It moved like this.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I was wondering what to do.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
At this time, if I let it go, I don't know how many more there will be.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
At that stage, there are a lot of them.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I haven't seen it for a while.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You mean there's only one?

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I haven't seen it for a while.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It just came in from somewhere.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to think that if I kill it, it should be okay.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I want it to say that.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I couldn't help it, so I looked for something to hit.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There was nothing.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I couldn't help it, so I went to the toilet.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I took it out like a samurai.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I thought I had to do it in one shot.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I thought I had to do it in one shot.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I couldn't do it at all.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I ran out of the toilet.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There was a carpet outside.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I ran to the carpet.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Cockroaches can't run fast on the carpet, can they?

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't know.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was wondering slowly.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was in this state.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was in this state.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I couldn't do it.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I couldn't hit it.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was doing it like this.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was surprised.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I was surprised.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Something came out.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What do you think?

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's pathetic.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's pathetic.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think so.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know what it is.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know what it is.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know what it is.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was able to beat the cockroach.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But it was almost the same size as the cockroach.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's pathetic.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was doing it in the middle.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The cockroach was still there.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I went back to the toilet.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But the toilet door was still open.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I could see the cockroach and the poop.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The color was the same.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It was the same color.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Only one of them was warm.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This cockroach was worse than this one.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You did it.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll tell you later.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What do you think it is?

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You couldn't hit it.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't think so.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Did you hit it?

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What is it?

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was running away.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is blue.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was worried about how to deal with it.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is a short one.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Can you remove it with a tissue?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't like cockroaches under a tissue.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can remove as many as you want.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can remove 5 and hit it.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can hit it.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You don't have to hit it so hard.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can remove it softly.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't do that.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't hit it so hard.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It can't be helped.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can remove it softly.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do you mean?

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can remove it softly.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can hit it softly.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you hit it with this, it's a cockroach.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's why I don't know how to remove it.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can't hit it.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You can hit it like this.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can hit it with a rock.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's still thick.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm relieved that it's stuck.

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was able to remove it.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is it.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is better.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why?

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It doesn't move.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that so?

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You can remove it quickly.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a carpet, right?

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The carpet's hair is like this.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm holding it at the tip of this part.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now I don't have to hurt them that much.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This fluffy feeling is very delicate.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You don't have to remove it like that.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't like that.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't like poop.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What is it?

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What is it?

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's poop.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think I hate cockroaches the most.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you hit it with a rock, it's over.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't like that rustling sound.

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Right?

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If it was a Japanese paper, it would be like this.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It would stand up.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If I did that, I would scream.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There is such a thing.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No, no.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If I did this.

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If I did that, I would scream.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If I did that, I would scream.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Cockroaches are very conscious of their friends.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When I was a kid, I was killed by a newspaper.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I was killed.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I felt something in my eyes.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was killed.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I looked at the other side of the wall.

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was scared.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's...

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just folded it.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, no. I saw it completely.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That face is strange.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I didn't look at it like this.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I just folded it.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, no.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's like this.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not like this.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's like this.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like this.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I saw it.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't believe it.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There were three or four of them.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I didn't look at it.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I saw it in a different place.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's true.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is...

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, no.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is...

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That was a floor type.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is a wall type.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's true.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I didn't look at it like this.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I just folded it.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's like this.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's true.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's like this.

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's not like this.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There were four of them.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was scared.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's true.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't fold it like this.

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I folded it like this.

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That face is strange.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Matsumoto-san, when you were a kid, you ate all the goldfish from the fish market.

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How did you manage to eat so many goldfish?

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's...

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's a strange question.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is that so?

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you mean?

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because...

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Goldfish...

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Goldfish...

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Goldfish...

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Goldfish...

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Goldfish...

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's strange.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
In the cage of the goldfish rescue, in the aquarium...

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's not like you were born in a cage.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's true.

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right?

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's true.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You were brought here.

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You were brought here.

213
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That means...

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In the aquarium of the goldfish rescue...

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't say that you didn't organize it.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You were saved by the aquarium of the goldfish rescue.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right?

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Where is the need to save them more than this?

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They were already saved.

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You don't need to be saved anymore.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you understand?

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I understand.

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you think about it, this question of his hasn't been established yet.

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But everyone was saved by the goldfish rescue, right?

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, yes.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's human ego.

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You want to save the goldfish, right?

228
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it was me who saved the goldfish for the first time.

229
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's a big mistake.

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes, yes, yes.

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I understand that.

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right?

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You thought your girlfriend was a virgin.

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You know how you want to think you're the first man.

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you've been saved many times.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You've been beaten many times.

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you stupid?

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why are you making such an analogy?

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You don't need to talk about the goldfish rescue.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But people who go there don't know that the goldfish are thinking that way.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We were saved once, but you think you're the first man.

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You don't understand the feelings of the goldfish.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So last week, I went there.

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Kawaguchiko.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I went to Kawaguchiko, right?

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Someone said something like that.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But to be honest, I won.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't say such things every day.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Everyone saw it.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's not fun if there's such a big difference.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't tie the thread in the second half.

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I went there.

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I said I won the goldfish rescue.

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The goldfish that everyone loves.

255
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's talk about it.

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The big bass that Matsumoto caught.

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't catch it for the first time.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was released by Kat-chan.

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It was caught by Sugimura-san in Yamanashi Prefecture.

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know.

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll catch it again.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's right.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's not a story.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's right.

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a story about how to treat humans.

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So how do you explain the goldfish rescue story?

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you say that, the old man at the goldfish rescue saved it all.

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I didn't save the goldfish rescue.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The old man didn't save it one by one.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The old man just put it in a bucket.

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I saved it one by one because it cost a few hundred yen.

273
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
How did you do that?

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait a minute.

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait a minute.

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're weird.

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The old man at the goldfish rescue saved it in a bucket.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why can't you decide that?

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The old man just did it.

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know if he managed to sell it.

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, no, no.

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't go to the store all day.

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can't go to the store all day.

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You want to bring it, right?

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why did it become like this?

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're weird.

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're weird.

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It was so much fun back then.

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're weird.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
How did you save it?

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can't say that you saved it all in a bucket.

292
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't lick the goldfish.

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're weird.

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm glad it came out.

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you glad?

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why are you so grumpy?

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm grumpy.

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You said it was fun.

299
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not grumpy.

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was so much fun to the airport.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're weird.

302
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not grumpy.

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If you tell me how to do it, it's over.

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What are you talking about?

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm telling you that I saved the goldfish.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You too, you too, you too, you too.

307
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You might not be like that.

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
How did you decide that?

309
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I was wearing a patterned shirt.

310
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, really?

311
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's what I want to say.

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not like that.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We have a lot of goldfish.

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Normally, two or three of them will break.

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Right?

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You saved all of them, didn't you?

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You saved them, didn't you?

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You saved them, didn't you?

321
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I did.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Didn't you break them?

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I did.

324
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How much did you break them?

325
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What?

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You broke them all at once?

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If I broke them all at once, wouldn't I be able to save them all?

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then, I'll write to the old man again.

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
A new one.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You want to save them all with a new one until you save them all?

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's what I'm saying.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't like that.

333
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't like that idea.

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But it's okay.

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's okay.

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You can continue to save them, right?

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If he asks me, I'll tell him that anyone can do it.

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a question of money.

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then, I have an idea.

340
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm doing this, right?

341
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I have a bowl here, and I'm doing this, so I can't do it.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I just have to put it in.

343
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If I put it in the bowl, I just have to stand like this.

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Then, it's us.

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's with this sense of inferiority?

346
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know if it's a sense of inferiority or not.

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Which side are you on?

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Who are you talking to?

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Are you talking to a goldfish?

350
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm talking to a goldfish, and I want to talk to the old man, too.

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This story is...

352
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Cut it out.

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm in a bad mood.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm in a bad mood.

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who's crying so much even though he's not married.

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's right.

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I heard that there are two types of marriage, love marriage, and fake marriage.

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What kind of marriage is that?

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's a lot more.

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Please tell me about it.

361
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Now, fake marriage is the mainstream.

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The most orthodox marriage is fake marriage.

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No, it's fine.

364
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why do you get married when you're already fake?

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You get married because you're already fake.

366
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You get married because you're in a good mood.

367
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You get married because you think you're in love.

368
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You get married because you're already fake.

369
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Fake marriage is when a woman is in love with a man.

370
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's the way it is.

371
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's the way it is.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Fake marriage is when a woman is working and a man is doing housework.

373
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a couple.

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're always at home, so you get stressed.

375
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You lose a lot of hair.

376
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
One day, your wife comes home from work and says,

377
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm so tired.

378
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Your boyfriend says,

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've lost a lot of hair.

380
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're like,

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Is it really my fault?

382
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you understand?

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I understand.

384
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
There's a lot more, but I'll leave it at that for today.

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There's a lot more, but I'll leave it at that for today.

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I spent a lot of time at the goldfish.

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I didn't expect it.

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's you.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There was an ambush.

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's you.

391
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's you.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's you.

393
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's you.

394
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's you.

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's you.

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's you.

397
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's you.

398
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's you.

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's you.

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's you.

401
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's you.

402
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's you.

403
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's you.

404
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's you.

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's you.

406
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's you.

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You lose everything.

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I did.

409
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's the red t-shirt that I wore the most.

410
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you doing?

411
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What's wrong?

412
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I want you to do it quickly.

413
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's that one.

414
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I want you to do the punishment game quickly.

415
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's that one, right?

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Punishment? What punishment?

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No, no, no.

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What's the punishment?

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What's good?

420
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We did it too.

421
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
According to a theory, if you win the last week's fishing, you'll become Mr. Goa.

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, no, no.

423
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't say that.

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There was a theory.

425
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Who said that?

426
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Suga-chan said it.

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I didn't say it.

428
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There was a theory.

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What?

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
There's a theory that you'll become Mr. Goa.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Mr. Suga said it?

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's not true.

433
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's not true.

434
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay, let's do it.

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We did it.

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What are we going to do?

437
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are we going to do?

438
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We had a lot of trouble.

439
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's right.

440
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Mentally and physically.

441
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Wait, wait.

442
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's a tag.

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
24 hours of tag.

444
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A tag is a child's play.

445
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a child's play.

446
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No, no, no.

447
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's right.

448
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We had a lot of trouble.

449
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We played tag and a scary demon appeared.

450
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's right.

451
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's the same thing.

452
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You have to do something like that.

453
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You guys lost to me.

454
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I think that punishment game was tough.

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But you lost because you ran, right?

456
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes.

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Then why did I lose?

458
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You said you were a swimmer.

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No, I lost because I swam.

460
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No, no.

461
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why did I lose?

462
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm a human with two legs.

463
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No, no, no.

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The question is why did I lose?

465
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why did I lose?

466
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Two legs.

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The question is why did I lose?

468
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Listen to me.

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If a human with two legs loses by running, it's a shame.

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you lose, you lose.

471
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You do that sometimes.

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Right?

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes.

474
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So...

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's cute.

476
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's cute.

477
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's cute.

478
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's cute.

479
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's cute.

480
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's cute.

481
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's cute.

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So...

483
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If you do the same thing as that...

484
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You won't be convinced.

485
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So...

486
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We talked about this before.

487
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You did it, right?

488
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
At school for 24 hours.

489
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes.

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
At midnight.

491
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You can do that.

492
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can do that.

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then...

494
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Please forgive me.

495
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why are you apologizing so much?

496
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why?

497
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There's a reason why you lost.

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
There's a reason why you lost.

499
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Did you do it, Yamazaki?

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If you're a good student, you won't lose.

501
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You're just making excuses.

502
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
No, no.

503
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's not true.

504
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I didn't do it because I didn't like it.

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm scared.

506
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's okay.

507
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You can do that.

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I...

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's a punishment.

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You can do that.

511
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Right?

512
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You can do that.

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, no.

514
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't lose.

515
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's not like that.

516
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Please stop.

517
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Please stop.

518
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not like that.

519
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No one has a responsibility.

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's you.

521
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's your responsibility.

522
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No, no.

523
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So, let's do that.

524
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
24 hours.

525
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You can't pick one.

526
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You can have Fujiwara with you.

527
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

528
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Just two of us.

529
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Fujiwara.

530
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sure Fujiwara will be okay.

531
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Sure?

532
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sure Fujiwara will be okay.

533
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How do you feel?

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's up to you.

535
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
President! Who decided that?

536
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Us, us.

537
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
No, no, no. What are you doing?

538
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What did you decide on your own?

539
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I bought it for my wife.

540
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

541
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
For example, when the five of us went to the toilet,

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
you decided on the order on your own.

543
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You didn't want that, did you?

544
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You decided on the tuna gosen on your own.

545
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You didn't want that, did you?

546
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know about the tuna gosen.

547
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Do you know about that?

548
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You didn't want that, did you?

549
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You didn't want that, did you?

550
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This time, we decided on it.

551
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Last time, we decided on it on our own.

552
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Is that so?

553
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No, no, no. That's because I bought it.

554
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's why we bought it.

555
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's why we bought it.

556
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's why we lost.

557
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Even now, if you play a completely different game,

558
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you won't be able to accept it.

559
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's right.

560
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What about the customers?

561
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well, the schedule is difficult.

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Little by little, I'm going to get tired.

563
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What?

564
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're going to get tired?

565
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm going to work out.

566
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're going to work out?

567
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm going to work out.

568
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're going to work out?

569
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't want to.

570
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think I want to.

571
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I mean I don't want to, but for the sake of this show.

572
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No, it's not for the sake of it.

573
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I lost.

574
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This isn't right.

575
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No.

576
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Honestly, I have a long-standing love for this show.

577
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Then, after Hey Hey Deluxe, I like this number 3.

578
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Number 3?

579
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
When did you think of that?

580
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What are you doing, Kazuma-san?
