1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The chief director of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen is still in his 40s.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He has the world's first encounter with an actress he admires.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Kazuma-san.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I have a different guest today.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to help people.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I saw Otomo-san's video.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There's another unhappy guy.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Last week and this week...

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, no.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Last week, I tried to kill him.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This week, I'm trying to help him.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm happy.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm the world's Heipou.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Heipou-san, please come in.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I have a different guest today.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Please come in.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He's wearing a suit.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm the chief director of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Kazuma-san, this is the past.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's an article in the TV industry.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's an example of a famous talent getting married.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The representative is Sayuru Yoshinaga.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's the main producer of Fuji TV.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yoshiko Mita.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The producer of NHK.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There are many producers.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What about this?

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is it going to be on Kaminuma TV?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, no.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Kaminuma-san will be on Kanzai TV.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I know that.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm counting on you.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sure some of you have noticed.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's no Japanese TV.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Even if there's Fuji, NHK, and TBS.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's no TV.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's put Heipou in here.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Who does Heipou like?

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This person.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Naoko Amihama-san.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Naoko Amihama.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She has a mysterious look and a slender body.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She's very active in singing and drama.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
27 years old.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's just right.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm 40 years old.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm 82 centimeters tall.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
82 centimeters.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you think?

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is your father taller?

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, I'm just 82 centimeters tall.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
82 centimeters is good.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're very stylish, Amihama-san.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I like people who are tall.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I see.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I like Heipou who is tall.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Heipou is as tall as Kanabun.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Amihama-san.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm calling you in the morning.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I hope you have a good time today.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And there's a silhouette.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is it.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mr. Matsumoto, for example, you have this.

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll turn on the switch when it's off.

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's open.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's pretty good.

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is an indication.

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is it an indication?

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's more Heipou.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Go.

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Go.

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Run, Heipou.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, I understand.

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is the sign.

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you remember that time at Godanda?

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I understand.

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It was like this.

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Put it in your pants and put it on your butt.

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a little Heipou.

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Is that okay?

97
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a little Heipou.

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello.

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you for waiting.

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Naoko, come on in.

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you for waiting.

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is my wife.

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello.

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is Naoko.

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Nice to meet you.

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please sit down.

112
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Please sit down.

113
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Naoko, sit down.

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no, no.

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Really.

117
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The weather is nice.

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It was good.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Really.

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I brought Naoko's book.

123
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is that so?

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go ahead.

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you for waiting.

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Have you ever met Toshihide?

127
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No.

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is the first time I've met him.

129
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is that so?

130
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

131
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is the first time I've met him.

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is that so?

133
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is Mr. Amihama.

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Mr. Amihama.

135
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You always say that.

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Amihama.

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's good.

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My Naoko is not here either.

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is the first time.

142
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How do you feel to meet him for the first time today?

143
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's a beautiful person, so I'm very honored.

144
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is that so?

145
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you very much.

146
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What about Naoko?

147
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

148
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's the first time I've met him.

149
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've seen him on TV.

150
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Have you seen him on TV?

151
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How do you feel to see him in person?

153
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's better to see him in person.

154
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is that so?

155
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

156
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's rare.

157
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He looks dirty on TV.

158
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It doesn't matter.

160
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Naoko.

161
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

162
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you drink alcohol?

163
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you drink alcohol?

164
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

165
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is your wife alone now?

167
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm alone.

168
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My husband is gone.

169
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But I can do things by myself.

171
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is funny.

172
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is a masterpiece.

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is an interesting story.

174
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Is that so?

175
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you talking about?

176
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is that so?

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
TOSHIHIDE.

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm talking about you.

179
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can I ask you something?

180
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
TOSHIHIDE?

181
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

182
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I heard something amazing about TOSHIHIDE on the previous show.

183
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What is it?

184
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I heard something like this.

185
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is that so?

186
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is that so?

187
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
TOSHIHIDE is lonely.

188
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

189
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
TOSHIHIDE is lonely.

190
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
TOSHIHIDE is lonely.

191
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
TOSHIHIDE sometimes depends on GANG.

192
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is that so?

193
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How about you, Naoko?

194
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you depend on GANG?

196
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Occasionally.

197
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's good.

198
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's good.

199
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's a good match.

200
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's funny.

201
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
After all, we are young people.

202
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

203
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I didn't notice at all.

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I didn't notice.

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
TOSHIHIDE, thank you.

207
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
See you later.

208
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm Saito.

209
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I often see you on TV.

210
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've been a fan for a long time.

211
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is that so?

212
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

213
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The other day, I went to the baseball game.

214
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

215
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's funny.

216
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's funny.

217
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I've been a fan for a long time.

218
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was surprised.

219
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What are you talking about?

220
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thank you.

221
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you talking about?

222
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was surprised to see you.

223
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's why I'm here today.

224
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've been a fan for a long time.

225
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have a lot of photos.

226
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is it better to have a big chest?

227
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No.

228
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's just right.

229
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's just right.

230
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's just right.

231
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You should have a big chest.

234
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have a big chest.

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a long time since I've been with HEPO.

236
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm laughing at HEPO.

237
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm laughing at Zaito.

238
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm a little nervous.

239
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What about Zaito?

240
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What about Zaito?

241
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Zaito?

242
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think Zaito takes all the stories.

243
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Zaito is the leader.

244
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think Zaito takes all the stories.

245
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is that so?

246
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is there anyone who pulls you?

247
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's not true.

248
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I work hard.

249
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When I come home, there are people who spoil me.

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I think that's the way it is.

251
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's the way it is.

252
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Please come here.

253
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Please come here.

254
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is a narrow place.

255
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How big is it?

256
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't think it's big enough.

257
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think this is a little too big.

258
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's like an action star.

259
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's like an action star.

260
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's funny.

261
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you doing?

263
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry to ask you this for the first time.

264
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you have any memories?

265
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you have any memories?

267
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I kissed you.

268
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm grateful for that.

269
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know if he's in a hurry.

270
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

271
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Please drink.

272
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's hard.

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's hard.

274
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I think you're a mister.

276
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

277
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's okay.

279
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think you're a mister.

280
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think you're a mister.

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

282
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think you're a mister.

283
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

284
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Please drink.

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry for the sudden request.

286
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is that?

287
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't drink.

288
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll drink a little.

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What should I do?

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's my first time.

291
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll drink a little.

292
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll drink a little.

293
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, no, no.

294
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll drink a little.

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll drink a little.

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll drink a little.

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No, no, no.

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll drink a little.

299
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Shut up.

300
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What are you doing?

301
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What are you doing?

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't do this in the future.

304
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't drink.

305
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It seems to be disbanded again.

307
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We.

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It seems to be disbanded again.

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It seems to be disbanded again.

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know that.

312
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Downtown something.

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This is it.

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why do you have so much?

316
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hama-chan.

317
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hama-chan's singer debut.

318
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What does this mean?

319
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Matsumoto-san published a book and became a bestseller.

320
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I had nothing to do with it.

321
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I came here and Hama-chan said,

322
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm going to make a bestseller.

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I made my solo debut.

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Even if it's just the two of us, if you do something like that, we'll be like this.

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If that's the case, it's disbanded.

326
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The difference in this year's income is open.

327
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to sing this song next year.

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's why it's disbanded.

329
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What is that?

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why are you exposed?

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why?

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I saw it at first.

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is this you?

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, no, no.

335
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's Speedy Wonder.

336
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

337
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No, it's Matsumoto Hitoshi Speedy Wonder.

338
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's Speedy.

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's Speedy.

340
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's completely different.

341
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Is that so?

342
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't know this.

343
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
When I went home after the show, I told you.

344
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not broken at all.

345
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not broken at all.

346
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When I went home the other day, it was broken.

347
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If it's broken, it's broken.

348
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's still annoying.

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's not broken.

350
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The window was open.

351
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You can give me something.

352
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, thank you.

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can give you a lot of candy.

354
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When I opened the window,

355
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I heard the sound of the car.

356
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I put it in the car.

357
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's annoying at that point.

358
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I put it in the car with a magic cap.

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Stop it.

360
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's not funny.

361
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's nothing to laugh about.

362
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's been a long time since I've been so pissed off.

363
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You were so pissed off.

364
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Poison was coming out of my nails.

365
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are you human?

366
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm not saying that I was that pissed off.

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I know that.

368
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was really pissed off.

369
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you tell her?

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, I didn't.

371
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

372
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I didn't tell her.

373
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I see.

374
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm pissed off because...

375
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Other girls around me were like,

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm scared.

377
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I said I'm not scared.

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You'll get angry.

379
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll get angry.

380
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We're the same.

381
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You won't get angry with me.

382
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Poison comes out of my nails.

383
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, no.

384
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're the only one.

385
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
In a week...

386
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You have a week, right?

387
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're done with school, right?

388
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There are some things that piss me off.

389
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I went to eat Cambodian food the other day.

390
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, you went to Okunino?

391
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No, no.

392
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think I went to Okunino.

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You missed it, didn't you?

394
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was like...

395
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Excuse me, can I have some yakisoba?

396
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I went to a Cambodian waitress.

397
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It was a woman.

398
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Can I have some yakisoba?

399
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Say it.

400
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Can I have some yakisoba?

401
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What?

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't hear you.

403
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's so good.

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What?

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
She yelled at me.

406
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't say that.

407
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't hear you.

408
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can't hear you at all.

409
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, no.

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
She yelled at me.

411
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What?

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She yelled at me.

413
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It was so good.

414
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
She yelled at me.

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I couldn't stop laughing.

416
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It was worse than getting angry.

417
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It was worse than getting angry.

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I couldn't stop laughing.

419
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I couldn't stop laughing with her.

420
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What?

421
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What?

422
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It was funny.

423
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
She yelled at me.

424
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I was surprised.

425
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I didn't think she yelled at me.

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Do you want to go to a Cambodian restaurant next week?

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Come here.

428
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She doesn't know anything about talent.

429
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She doesn't know anything about talent.

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you want to go to a Cambodian restaurant next week?

431
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Do you want to go to a Cambodian restaurant next week?

432
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please give me yakisoba.

433
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You are really...

434
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Maybe the keyword is yakisoba.

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So, if you order extra food at a random place,

436
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If you order extra food and say,

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please give me yakisoba,

438
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll definitely say,

439
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll definitely say,

440
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll definitely say,

441
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's do that.

442
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's go to a Cambodian restaurant next week.

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll definitely say that.

444
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I've met a lot of people like this.

445
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's because you are a pervert.

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm a pervert?

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're a pervert, so you're a pervert.

448
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm a pervert, so I'm a pervert.

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm a pervert, so I'm a pervert.

450
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why?

451
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Did you get on the bus?

452
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Did you get on the bus?

453
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You were in a press conference, weren't you?

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I was in a press conference with Mr. Komura.

455
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I was in a press conference with Mr. Komura.

456
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Again?

457
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What are you talking about?

458
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You were doing something, weren't you?

459
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's right.

460
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Let's go to the post office.

461
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There's someone you like sitting behind you at school.

462
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is there a way to give that person a good feeling?

463
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's someone you like sitting behind you at school.

464
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is there a way to give that person a good feeling?

465
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're sitting behind me, right?

466
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't know.

467
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's right.

468
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know.

469
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's right.

470
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're sitting like this, aren't you?

471
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

472
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you sit like this, you'll be like,

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What is this guy?

474
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I have to look at his face.

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes.

476
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Of course, you have to look at his face.

477
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's painful if you don't have a little more contact.

478
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, I do.

479
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You do this, right?

480
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If you do it like this...

481
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Sensei!

482
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm scared!

483
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Sensei, I'm scared!

484
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Matsumoto-kun is weird!

485
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's like this.

486
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Shut up.

487
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You see?

488
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There's nothing for Sensei to do after I give you the hint!

489
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just give it to me already!

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Why are you looking back and not dancing?

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Ma-chan, you said you wouldn't be late this year.

492
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How is the actual situation?

493
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is...

494
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How do I say this?

495
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I was so surprised by myself.

496
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't remember being late at all.

497
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
No, no, no, the other day at the shopping district...

498
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I looked at the clock and it was already 3 o'clock.

499
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's weird.

500
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Is he at home right now?

501
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is the real thing.

502
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't think I should say this.

503
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you mean?

504
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There are a few episodes of this show where you laugh, right?

505
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Why are you crying, Matsumoto-kun?

506
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Why are you crying, Matsumoto-kun?

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The audience is screaming.

508
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm scared of that.

509
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You have a blue face.

510
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I was awake.

511
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You were awake?

512
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I was awake.

513
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was wearing an Armani suit.

514
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I was up and I was wearing an Armani suit.

515
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I was up and I was wearing an Armani suit.

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He didn't have one.

517
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When I was about to go,

518
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's like a rakugo roll.

519
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's like...

520
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Open it. Open it.

521
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The heat...

522
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't want to go back to my room, Shou-chan!

523
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Shou-chan lives in the neighborhood.

524
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Shou-chan's mother is holding Shou-chan.

525
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Why is she holding you?

526
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't want to!

527
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, you're such a small kid.

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I see.

529
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And then...

530
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Something terrible happened.

531
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're Shou-chan?

532
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There's a fish called Shusseifu.

533
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
For example, when a Kampachi comes out, it becomes a Hamachi.

534
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And when it comes out again, it becomes a Buri.

535
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What do you...

536
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What do you mean by coming out?

537
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Do you know? Kampachi becomes a Hamachi.

538
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And Hamachi becomes a Buri.

539
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Do you know?

540
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I've heard of it.

541
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But I don't know exactly what Kampachi is.

542
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Fish is really amazing.

543
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Do you know what comes after a Buri?

544
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What?

545
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you know what comes after a Buri?

546
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Isn't it a Kanketsu?

547
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's coming out.

548
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The Buri is...

549
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
While I'm doing this,

550
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the Buri is coming out.

551
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's coming out more and more.

552
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why isn't it coming out at the fish shop?

553
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's because it was killed during the Buri stage.

554
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You can't kill it.

555
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It has too much power.

556
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a fish.

557
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No, no, no.

558
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's up to the Buri stage.

559
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If you can kill it, it's amazing.

560
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Stop it.

561
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop it!

562
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Hey!

563
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Who are you?

564
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What comes after a Buri?

565
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What?

566
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
A Super Buri?

567
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then it becomes an FX.

568
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's a Kamen Rider.

569
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It becomes a Black.

570
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What are you talking about?

571
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It becomes a fake Buri.

572
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's what it becomes.

573
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's laugh a little more.

574
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's funny.

575
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's a fake Buri.

576
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The color of the scarf is different.

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I didn't know what you were talking about.

578
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What are you doing?

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It doesn't matter.

580
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The other day,

581
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I went out with my girlfriend for half a year.

582
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
She said,

583
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You have a big ***.

584
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Mr. Matsumoto,

585
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't you have anything to gain from your ***?

586
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course I have.

587
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's a big ball.

588
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't have anything to gain from it.

589
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You know what?

590
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I think it's good for greetings.

591
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Why?

592
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Normally, you say,

593
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hello.

594
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not like that.

595
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's a big ball.

596
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a ***.

597
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's like this.

598
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's like this.

599
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's elegant.

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Then,

601
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why is it out?

602
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because it's big.

603
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can see that it's big.

604
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a big ball.

605
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What are you doing?

606
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's going to stick to your tongue.

607
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to stick it to my tongue.

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm not going to do anything.

609
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm not going anywhere.

610
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm going to do the ***.

611
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, no.

612
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,160
C-g-g-g-g-ra-g-a-a-g-a-g-g-

613
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,740
Because this will stop pew pew seller

614
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,900
And in hot of this the strong cookie

615
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,400
What about my secret weapon

616
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,200
You um

617
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,180
I am talking about Setsuna-ken

618
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
What?

619
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
What?

620
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
What's that?

621
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
Is it a sadism?

622
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,180
The one who did it, or rather the one who got hit...

623
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
What's that?

624
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
Which one?

625
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
No, no, no.

626
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
The one who got hit...

627
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
The one who got hit...

628
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,180
...or rather the one who got hit...

629
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
...or rather the one who got hit is sadistic.

630
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Is that a special move?

631
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
What are you talking about?

632
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
It's a mistake.

633
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
What?

634
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Does that mean I'm going to be a partner killer?

635
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
That's none of your business.

636
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't like that.

637
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Do it.

638
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
What's that?

639
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
That's...

640
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
...a sadistic move.

641
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
It's already started.

642
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
It's a sadistic move.

643
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
It's already started.

644
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,180
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

645
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Don't hit the Setsuna-ken.

646
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
I'm sorry, it's a sadistic move.

647
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
The power has already been accumulated.

648
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,180
It's a simple story.

649
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
It's not strong at all.

650
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
I'm sorry.

651
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
Please do it.

652
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,180
Please do it.

653
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
I'll go.

654
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Yes.

655
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
I'll go.
