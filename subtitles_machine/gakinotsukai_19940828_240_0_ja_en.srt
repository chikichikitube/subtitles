1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Police mill

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,520
Let me konk aerial report.

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Please enter the prosecutor's office.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Please enter the prosecutor's office.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Defendant, please take your seat.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Your Honor.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Yes.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Let's begin the trial of Akiko Wada, who was a man.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Before we begin the trial,

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I'd like to ask Professor Matsumoto, who is said to have obtained a large amount of evidence, to come in and verify it.

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
Professor Matsumoto, please come in.

12
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Nice to meet you.

13
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Nice to meet you too.

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,520
I was very surprised this time.

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
That's right. I was surprised too.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Yes.

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
That's why I asked the professor.

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Yes, yes, yes.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
As expected, that's right.

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
That's right.

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:56,520
After the investigation, it turned out that he was a really strange man.

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,520
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Let's take a look at the evidence photo.

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Evidence photo?

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Wada, you bastard, look at this bastard.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm going to rip off your monster face today.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Let's take a look at it for now.

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,520
This is the photo of the pilot Wada.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,520
If you look at it like this, it's not much different from the Wada we usually see.

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
That's right.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
And I used a computer to get a closer look at the camera.

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
It's closer, isn't it?

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Yes, it's closer.

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Then it looks like this.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Even with this, you can't tell the difference.

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Is that so?

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
You can't tell the difference.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
You've been deceiving the world for over 20 years, haven't you?

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
That's right.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I got even closer.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Then I found out something terrible.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
You bastard!

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
That's what I thought!

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You look like a bandit.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Professor.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Yes.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
You look like a bandit.

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
No, no, no.

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
This is the first evidence.

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Even with this, it's enough.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
You look like an old man.

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Let's take a look at the photos of the pilot.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
For example.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
What?

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Can't you defend yourself?

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
That's fine.

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Wait a minute.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
What is this photo?

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
What is this bulge?

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Don't do that!

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
You're a man!

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
You can't shake your butt.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
That's right.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,520
This is unthinkable.

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Moreover, the side of this old man is not good.

66
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
But.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Are you sure?

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Even women don't work at such a place these days.

69
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,520
I don't think this is evidence at all.

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
If you look at the next one.

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
You can see that he is a man.

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Is that so?

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,520
This is it.

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,520
He's in a sauna.

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,520
This bulging bulge.

76
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
It's natural.

77
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
It's very natural.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,520
He's a regular customer.

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,520
It's natural.

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
However.

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
He looks a little young, but his body is very thin.

82
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I guess it's like this.

83
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
And.

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
He is a witness.

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
That's right.

86
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm not the only one.

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
I have a video of the evidence.

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Please take a look at it.

89
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Why do you have a manager?

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,520
I think it was about 10 years ago when I became a manager.

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
I went to Asahikawa for a singing show.

92
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
After the show.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,520
I came to a nearby izakaya to drink.

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
On the way home.

95
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
He said he really wanted to go to the bathroom.

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
I was wondering if I should do it here.

97
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Is it okay?

98
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,520
I don't know if I'm going to talk about it or not.

99
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I asked Omomoro to stand up.

100
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
I thought it was like that.

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
This is my manager.

102
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
What are you talking about?

103
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
From that day on, I was able to date both men.

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,520
What are you talking about?

105
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Omomoro.

106
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
I have something to say.

107
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Wait a minute.

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
What is it?

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
This is strange.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
What's strange?

111
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
The police are forcing me to say this.

112
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
What are you talking about?

113
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Let me say one more thing.

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
He is also him.

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
You are also you.

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,520
He is the manager of our site.

118
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
I don't know what time the meeting will start.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,520
When I go to a meeting, you don't go to a meeting either.

120
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
That's it.

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Please take your seat.

122
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Please take your seat.

123
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Please take your seat.

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
You said it.

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
I couldn't hear you. Please say it again.

126
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Please take your seat.

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
All right.

128
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
The judge is weak.

129
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,520
So far, it's just my testimony and the video.

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,520
I think it's better to listen to the live voice.

131
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Is that so?

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
All right.

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
I'll call the witness.

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
This way.

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Witness, please come in.

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,520
You don't have to lie.

137
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Please be honest.

138
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,520
We are in the same agency as Mr. Wadawaki.

139
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
He invited me to a meal.

140
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
He took me to a bar.

141
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
He took you to a bar?

142
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,520
He took you to a bar?

143
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
He took me to a bar.

144
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
He has helped me a lot.

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I often get a phone call from my house.

146
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,520
The other day, I got a phone call from my house.

147
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
We were on the loose.

148
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
There was a message on the loose.

149
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
I brought the tape.

150
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I see.

151
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Let's listen to it.

152
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Hello, this is KUDO brothers.

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm out now.

154
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Please send me a message.

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Hello.

156
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Are you there?

157
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm at the school.

158
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
I was introduced to you.

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
You were very nice.

160
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm glad I met you.

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
I'll call you.

162
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
I'll call you for a while.

163
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Introduce me to a nice girl.

164
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Huh?

165
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
What?

166
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
I see.

167
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
What do you think of his voice?

168
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
He is obviously an old man.

169
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,520
The woman I introduced to you was very nice.

170
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I think it was similar to your voice.

171
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,520
He is a strange man.

172
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I understand.

174
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Thank you, KUDO brothers.

175
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Thank you.

176
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
KUDO brothers.

177
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Yes.

178
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
If you give us enough evidence, he won't say anything.

179
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
There is a lot.

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Is there anything else you want to say?

181
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,520
I have another great video.

182
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Really?

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Yes.

184
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Please watch it.

185
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
It will be a great decision.

186
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
I understand.

187
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Please watch it.

188
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
I think it was when I cried last year.

189
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
What are you talking about?

190
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
I was a little drunk.

191
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,520
He took me to the hospital.

192
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I was seen three or four times.

193
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,520
He was more manly than I saw on TV.

194
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,520
I can go home at least three times.

195
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
It's a decision.

196
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
It's a decision.

197
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Is that a woman?

198
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
That's a woman.

199
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
That's a woman.

200
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,520
You know nothing.

201
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
It can't be helped.

202
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I developed a chart-based diagnosis method.

203
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
This shows the gender.

204
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I will take it off.

205
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I hate dogs.

206
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
He doesn't hate them now.

207
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
But he doesn't like them.

208
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
So it's a yes.

209
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Yes.

210
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Is that okay?

211
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Yes.

212
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,520
He is short.

213
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Which one?

214
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
It's a no.

215
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
It's a no.

216
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Yes.

217
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
He is from Osaka.

218
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Answer it.

219
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
It's a yes.

220
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
It's a yes.

221
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
It's a yes.

222
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
It's a yes.

223
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
It's a yes.

224
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
It's a yes.

225
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
It's a yes.

226
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
It's a yes.

227
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It's a yes.

228
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
It's a yes.

229
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
It's a yes.

230
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Excuse me.

231
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Stop it.

232
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Other than the fact that he hates dogs, he can only answer yes.

233
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
What else?

234
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Excuse me.

235
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Shut up.

236
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Judge, please give the verdict.

237
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
The defendant, please come to the center.

238
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
What are you talking about?

239
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Come to the center.

240
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
The verdict.

241
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
The defendant, Wada Akiho.

242
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Wada Akiho?

243
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Yes.

244
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,520
The verdict.

245
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Come out.

246
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
It's a no.

247
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
It's a no.

248
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
It's a no.

249
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
It's a no.

250
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
It's a no.

251
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
It's a no.

252
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:06,520
It's a no.

253
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,520
What has changed recently?

254
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Oh, that's it.

255
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
What?

256
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:28,520
It seems that you've gained weight.

257
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
I've gained weight.

258
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Did you cry this time?

260
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,520
I didn't cry last time, but I didn't cry this time either.

261
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I was so moved that I cried when I went skydiving.

262
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
I was so moved that I cried that time.

263
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,520
It's been a long time since I did a rerun.

264
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
The blonde one.

265
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,520
It's no good, but I'm going to cry.

266
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,520
No matter how many times I watch it, it's no good.

267
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I've never seen blonde before.

268
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Don't you see that?

269
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,520
There's a lot of crying.

270
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm doing a lot of dramas right now, but I can't win against blonde.

271
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Because you have a great graduation ceremony.

272
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Adada was never a good student.

273
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,520
What are you talking about?

274
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Calm down.

275
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
You're a good student.

276
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm telling you the last lesson.

277
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,520
You guys were never a good student.

278
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Don't say that.

279
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Don't say that on the last episode.

280
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
At the end.

281
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Don't say that on the last episode, blonde.

282
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Don't say that.

283
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Don't say that.

284
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Don't make me feel like I've been betrayed.

285
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Don't be impatient.

286
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Don't make me feel like I've been betrayed.

287
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Don't worry.

288
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:08,520
This time, I'm going to love you guys.

289
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,520
No, no, no.

290
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,520
No matter how many times I watch it, it's no good.

291
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I don't think so.

292
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
It's really good.

293
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
The last one.

294
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,520
The one with domestic violence.

295
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
The one with Kato Masaru.

296
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,520
The one with Kato Masaru.

297
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
You can't even put him in a car.

298
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,520
You can't even put him in a car.

299
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Before you get in.

300
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
You can't say that.

301
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
You can't say that on the song of Miyuki Nagajima.

302
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Don't say that.

303
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I don't watch it at all.

304
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I said I don't watch it.

305
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
I said I don't watch it at first.

306
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
I don't watch it.

307
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,520
I go to the factory and broadcast it.

308
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Then go.

309
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Apologize.

310
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Apologize.

311
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Apologize.

312
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Apologize.

313
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,520
What are you doing?

314
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
You can't do that.

315
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
What do you mean?

316
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
You'll be released.

317
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,520
You'll be released.

318
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I have a gold под when I get in.

319
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll look at you and hold you.

320
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
You're our..

321
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,520
You are wrong.

322
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
You are my students.

323
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
You are my students.

324
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,520
You are wrong.

325
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
You have to do it again.

326
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
You don't have to do it again.

327
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm like, don't forget it!

328
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm crying so much.

329
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I don't know anything about you.

330
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
I'm not looking at you!

331
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Alright!

332
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Where did Kato Masaru get a job?

333
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
You want to know?

334
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Why did you have to ask me such a cult question with a blonde hair?

335
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
You should remember the Bokutou Kogyo!

336
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
The last one.

337
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
The last one.

338
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Well, I don't think that's true.

339
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Whose hair is that?

340
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
It's a blonde hair!

341
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
It's a blonde hair!

342
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
I don't think that's true.

343
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
It's a blonde hair now?

344
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
If there's someone who wants to become a politician,

345
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
They'll say,

346
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Give me 10,000 yen!

347
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Give me a lot of money!

348
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
If there's someone who wants to work at a beauty salon,

349
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
They'll say,

350
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Lend me some money until I'm tired.

351
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm crying right now.

352
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Why?

353
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Why?

354
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,520
And if there's someone who wants to become a school teacher,

355
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
They'll say,

356
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
What's that word?

357
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm already broke.

358
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
That's correct.

359
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
You remember?

360
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Alright.

361
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Alright.

362
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Where did Kato Masaru get a job?

363
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I don't know.

364
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I don't remember.

365
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
You just said it!

366
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
I just said it.

367
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
I don't know what to say.

368
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
I'll talk to you.

369
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
I'll talk to you for two weeks.

370
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Two weeks?

371
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Why two weeks?

372
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
No, really.

373
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Let's be more moved.

374
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Of course, I'm moved.

375
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,520
There are a lot of people who're moved all over the world.

376
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
You have to be more sensitive.

377
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Ah, really?

378
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
That's right.

379
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
No matter what you see,

380
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
no matter what you see,

381
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
no matter what you see,

382
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
there are moments when you think,

383
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Right?

384
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Yeah, sometimes.

385
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,520
There are times when the washing machine goes like this.

386
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
You're doing your best!

387
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
It's work.

388
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
There are times when it goes like this.

389
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
It's worse if you put it in.

390
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Lately, my impersonation has been polished again.

391
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
No, no.

392
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,520
The previous impersonation hasn't been polished at all.

393
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Who's that?

394
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
That's Hibari.

395
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Hama-chan.

396
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
That's Hibari.

397
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
I know that.

398
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Anyone can do it.

399
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Ussi-ssi-ssi.

400
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Ah, Kyo-san?

401
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Well, it's fine.

402
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Go ahead.

403
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
You don't need a follow-up?

404
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
This is amazing.

405
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Hama-chan's impersonation in Machikado.

406
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
I've done it before.

407
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
I've done it before.

408
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
I've done it before.

409
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
I've done it before.

410
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Someone introduced it before.

411
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
This is amazing.

412
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
It's similar.

413
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
It's not similar.

414
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
It's not similar.

415
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
It's a picture of a school trip.

416
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,520
I took it.

417
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Now, you're trying hard to look stylish.

418
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
You're trying hard to look stylish.

419
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
If you don't work hard, you'll be like this.

420
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
You'll be like this.

421
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Now, Japan is having a problem because of water shortage.

422
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Why is the sea water not decreasing?

423
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Why is the sea water not decreasing?

424
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
That's the point.

425
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Why is the sea water not decreasing?

426
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
That's what happened before.

427
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,520
This kind of story is usually told in fairy tales or old fairy tales.

428
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Is that so?

429
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
It's usually like that.

430
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Isn't it the same for all fairy tales?

431
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,520
What does Urashima Taro want to say?

432
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
What does Urashima Taro want to say?

433
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,520
He doesn't want to bully the turtle.

434
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
It's the same.

435
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
It's the same.

436
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
It's the same for all fairy tales.

437
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
What does Momotaro want to say?

438
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
What does Momotaro want to say?

439
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Momotaro wants to say that we should pick up the big peach.

440
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Momotaro wants to say that we should pick up the big peach.

441
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Why is the sea water not decreasing?

442
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Why is the sea water not decreasing?

443
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It's also in fairy tales.

444
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
What kind of story is it?

445
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
It's about a rabbit and a turtle.

446
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
It's called a rabbit and a turtle.

447
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,520
The rabbit wants to compete with the turtle.

448
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Alright.

449
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
The turtle was slow.

450
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
The turtle was slow.

451
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Taro can win.

452
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,520
And there is a enterprisingeedkid.

453
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,520
When it starts the turtle is slow so it ran away.

454
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
The turtle was bored.

455
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
The turtle was bored.

456
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,520
They slowly, slowly, one step at a time,

457
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes, yes, yes.

458
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
They overtook the sleeping rabbit,

459
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
That's right.

460
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
And won.

461
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Yes, yes, yes.

462
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,520
After that, the sea water turned into salt.

463
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Yes, that's the end of the commercial.

464
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Continue to the next part.

465
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Foreigners often have a broken jaw.

466
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Yes, there are.

467
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Do you have a way to use it?

468
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
No, I don't.

469
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Yes, there are.

470
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Something is stuck.

471
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Yes, yes, yes.

472
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,520
When I was told to line up in the center,

473
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
I didn't know how to match it.

474
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
In the center?

475
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Do you match it with that?

476
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
If it's broken, you can line it up straight.

477
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
You don't have to line it up in front.

478
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Why? How do you line it up?

479
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
What?

480
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
How do you line it up straight?

481
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
What are you talking about?

482
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
No, no, no.

483
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Why are you so angry?

484
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Who is that?

485
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
If you were told to line up here,

486
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
You can match your jaw with this hand.

487
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Why?

488
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
If you have something to say, say it.

489
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Come on, I'll answer you.

490
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Jump in more.

491
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,520
If you jump in, you'll definitely get it back.

492
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Who?

493
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Me.

494
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Americans are amazing.

495
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Do you know?

496
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I don't.

497
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
The other day, at McDonald's,

498
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
You know the coffee you bring home, right?

499
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,520
When you open it, you have to make a mistake.

500
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
It was really hot.

501
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I see.

502
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
I suffered for six weeks.

503
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Yes.

504
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
And I complained to McDonald's.

505
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
And that old lady bought it.

506
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
At the court?

507
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
McDonald's gave that old lady

508
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
250 million yen.

509
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
You paid for it?

510
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I had to pay for it.

511
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I told her to give me a lot of money.

512
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
It would be nice if you could use the minestrone.

513
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
That's right.

514
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
At the airport.

515
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,520
If I could use the minestrone, I wouldn't have to pay a single cent.

516
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I was sitting here.

517
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I was sitting here.

518
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
I was sitting on a macaroni.

519
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
I was sitting on a macaroni.

520
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
I laughed a little.

521
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Macaroni is like that.

522
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
It's a little stiff macaroni.

523
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
It's like a pirate ship.

524
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
I got it.

525
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
It's like a handle macaroni.

526
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
That's why I'm sitting here.

527
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Even now, when I'm angry, it comes out.

528
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Thank you for watching.
