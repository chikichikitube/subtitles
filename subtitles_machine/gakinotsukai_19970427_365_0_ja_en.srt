1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
As usual, there was a gloomy atmosphere in the dressing room.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm the one who bought it.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Tanaka and Endo are calling you.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Right now?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you coming?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everyone...

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sorry.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good morning.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Excuse me.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Excuse me.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Good morning.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Good morning.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Excuse me.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Excuse me.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I have something to talk to you about.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Have you been working hard lately?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, I've been working hard.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, I've been working hard.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Have you been eating well?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, I've been eating well.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You've been eating well.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You were talking on the phone yesterday.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I know you're having a hard time.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your father and mother are...

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You fell in love, so it can't be helped.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't talk about love anymore.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's different.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was talking to Hamada yesterday.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I want to leave the name Downtown.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you understand?

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, I understand.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why are you writing it?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Downtown.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's right.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm writing it.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can I give you the name Downtown?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The second Downtown life-threatening ceremony.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We decided it.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, I decided it.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My name is Downtown.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you want to do?

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What kind of feeling?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What kind of feeling?

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What kind of feeling?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What kind of feeling?

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What kind of feeling?

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, I'm Kokoriko now.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But how much power does Kokoriko have?

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't know.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not sure if I can entrust the name Downtown to them.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll see.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll see.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's the second one.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can we get the second Downtown?

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you do your best.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really?

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can do it.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We can do it.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you sure?

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, we can do it.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We can do it.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't react to it.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can't react to it.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is impossible.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We came all the way here because we took our pants.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Pants?

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We took the pants of many people.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So you can't stop us.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We used our power to stop them.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
With our pants?

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you kidding me?

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's show them.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the first time on TV.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We took our pants.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Excuse me.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You took something dirty.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is from the old days.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is from the 9th year of Heisei.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is the war.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The war?

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is from my grandmother.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is from my grandmother.

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's why I can't stop them.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's what the master said.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's how it is in this world.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There's nothing you can do about it.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There's nothing you can do about it.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is terrible.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Take a look at this.

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is terrible.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a red bread.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Red bread.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Red bread.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Asuka is huge.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Asuka watches it every week.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is terrible.

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is terrible.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is terrible.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you going to be okay?

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is terrible.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is terrible.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
At the last episode.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
At the last episode's opening.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You went to that?

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We only have this.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We went.

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But this is the worst.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is terrible.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is like the return of Night in Night.

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is like the return of Night in Night.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is also a bad thing.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is a rampage.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Stop it.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Stop it.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're going to be in trouble.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Their war goods don't stop at this.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Their war goods don't stop at this.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
First, Wadaaki.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They were suppressed by the two of them.

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Kin-chan.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When he went out to the enemy, he aimed.

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
His high heels are useless.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
His high heels are useless.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ryusuke Shinsuke.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They suddenly disbanded.

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They suddenly disbanded.

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They were attacked by a group of people in Kyoto.

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yasukiyo had to face a lot of difficulties.

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We took it like this.

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We took it like this.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's your turn.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's your turn.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Leave it to us.

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We'll take it.

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We'll take the second Downtown.

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We'll take the second Downtown.

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You only say the same thing.

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You only say the same thing.

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't have any more.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We have more.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please show us.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

151
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right.

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
When we were young, it was okay to take off our underwear.

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But now the times are different.

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a problem after you take it off.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
After you take it off,

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
on your butt,

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you have to blow your breath.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Your breath?

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Can I do that?

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's how you finally win.

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll do it.

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please.

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The five-year-old duo, Kokoriko.

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They are fighting against the popular comedy duo.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And they are fighting against the popular comedy duo.

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And they are fighting against the popular comedy duo.

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And they are fighting against the popular comedy duo.

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can they defeat the second generation of downtown?

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo.

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Kokoriko decided to defeat the popular comedy duo.

172
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
At first, I went to the Tokyo office.

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They said there were a lot of young people there.

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I wanted to go.

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Gokuraku.

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Gokuraku Tonbo.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Gokuraku Tonbo.

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Gokuraku Tonbo.

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Gokuraku Tonbo.

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They have been a duo for 8 years.

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They are active as a regular of Mecha-ike.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to do it with my life.

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm going to do it with my life.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm going to do it with my life.

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to get in your way.

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hey.

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's wrong?

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's wrong?

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What are you doing?

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's wrong?

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's like you're on TV.

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you on TV these days?

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Are you on TV?

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wait a minute.

196
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you a celebrity?

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Take off your underwear.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Wait a minute.

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Take off your underwear.

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait a minute.

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What is it?

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What is it?

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sit down.

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sit down.

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sit down.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Take off your underwear.

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll make you win.

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Who is the most powerful?

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Huh?

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's not true.

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who is the most powerful?

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who is the most powerful?

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Who is the most powerful?

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Who is the most powerful?

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's me.

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What's wrong with you?

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey!

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's wrong with you?

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think you all know this, but...

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
...you know that the entertainment industry...

222
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
...is being robbed of their underwear, right?

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What's wrong with you?

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I know that!

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm your senior, but...

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
...without you guys...

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
...we can do better in Tokyo!

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's our duty!

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So, I'm sorry, but...

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
...I came to take your underwear!

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What did you say?

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I didn't say anything.

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
For now...

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
...get ready!

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Get ready!

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Get ready!

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Take off your underwear!

238
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Take off your underwear!

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's funny if you take off your underwear!

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you talking about?

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And at the end...

242
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
...it's funny if you hit your butt!

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Get ready!

244
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Get ready!

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Get ready!

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go!

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll go.

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What about you, Gokuraku?

249
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll go.

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yamamoto!

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll go.

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's so simple!

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One punch!

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're crazy, Tanaka.

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're like Yatsume Unagi.

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is a different class.

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll go.

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hagi!

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't lose, Tanaka!

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll definitely win!

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't get in my way!

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll definitely win!

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll go.

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll go.

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
From the bottom!

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
From the bottom!

267
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
From the bottom!

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll go from here.

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll definitely win!

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll definitely win!

271
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
From the bottom!

272
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
From the bottom!

273
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey, you!

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, you!

275
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey!

276
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey!

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, Ibuki!

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey!

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey!

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hey!

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You guys, don't underestimate us.

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We're not the kind of people who climb up the stairs.

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We're the ones who climb up the stairs!

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're not the kind of people I'm looking for!

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's go.

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's go.

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Sorry, I was just looking around.

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was looking for the other guy that was not doing very well.

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If it was someone from the other side, I would have caught him.

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, if it was someone from the other side,

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I would have caught him.

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He was really bad.

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're young.

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm fine with the next one.

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He's not the type to be jealous of.

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't have anything to say to them.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't have anything bad to say to them.

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you very much.

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please watch the first episode.

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you very much.

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go.

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Good morning, good morning, good morning.

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Good morning.

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What are you doing?

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Norio Yoshio, who supported the comic boom.

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A super veteran of the comedy world.

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you know what comedy is?

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This industry, this industry.

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What are you talking about?

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What are you talking about?

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you know what it is?

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was really bad.

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was really bad.

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was really bad.

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, hey.

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It was really bad.

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It was really bad.

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What are you talking about?

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It was really bad.

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Sit down.

322
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sit down.

323
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This industry is a fight with panties.

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's a fight with panties.

325
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It was really bad.

326
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was really bad.

327
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What are you talking about?

328
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What are you talking about?

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your face is small.

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't think like that.

331
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Your face is small.

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you talking about?

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What is this?

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a fight with panties.

335
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This industry is a fight with panties.

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What is this?

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What is this?

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What is this?

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a fight with panties.

340
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was really bad.

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you talking about?

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This industry is a fight with panties.

343
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you talking about?

344
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What are you talking about?

345
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sit down.

346
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Get changed immediately.

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
A fight with panties.

348
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Komoriko?

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Go.

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yoshio?

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let me go!

352
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's going on?

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let me go!

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What?

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What's going on?

356
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go!

357
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Go!

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Go!

359
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Go!

360
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's amazing!

361
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Amazing!

362
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Go!

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Go!

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Go!

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Go!

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wait!

367
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're an a**hole!

368
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're just an a**hole!

369
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's the end!

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it's 1 win, 1 draw?

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
1 loss, 1 draw?

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes, 1 loss, 1 draw.

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We haven't won yet.

374
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So you guys can't beat us.

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In the next match,

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
we'll play 2 games in a row.

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So 2 wins in a row?

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes, 2 wins.

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Next.

380
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Look at me.

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Look at me?

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm telling you!

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There was no other way?

387
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There must be something.

388
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, let's see.

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's suspicious.

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We'll see.

391
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

392
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Good luck.

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Excuse me.

394
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Good morning.

395
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Good morning.

396
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Good morning.

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hey!

398
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Line up!

399
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Good morning.

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Line up!

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey!

402
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What are you guys doing?

403
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're having a meeting.

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's an event!

405
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's an event!

406
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's an event.

407
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's an event.

408
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What kind of event is this?

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Hey!

410
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Do you know what an event is?

411
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

412
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you know what an event is?

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do you know what an event is?

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Do you know what an event is?

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You don't, do you?

417
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
An event is a show of your underwear.

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Do you know what an event is?

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey!

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a comedy show.

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're getting closer.

422
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You said it was a comedy show.

423
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're getting closer.

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're getting closer.

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Get changed.

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Get changed.

427
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Get changed.

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're getting closer.

429
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're getting closer.

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You're getting closer.

431
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think I'm your junior.

432
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What do you mean?

434
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's me.

435
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's me.

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm the center of attention.

437
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm the center of attention.

438
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you guys think?

439
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What are you guys?

441
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What are your glasses?

442
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are your glasses?

443
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What are your glasses?

444
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You idiot!

445
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Are you drunk?

446
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm the center of attention.

447
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why are you shouting?

448
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm the center of attention.

449
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You guys.

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You guys.

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You guys are going to lose.

452
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're talking like a pig.

453
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Shut up!

454
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not going to lose.

455
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not going to lose.

456
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not going to lose.

457
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm not going to lose.

458
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm not going to lose.

459
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Get changed.

460
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What are you doing?

461
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Get changed.

462
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Stop.

463
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Stop.

464
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Brother.

465
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Stop.

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Stop.

467
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You have to stop.

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll do it.

469
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Punch and Punch!

470
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come here!

471
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes!

472
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You!

473
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes!

474
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I wonder if it's a good idea to punch Mano.

475
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But I don't want to be a fool.

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't think it's a co-op prize.

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you punch him now, you'll get another one.

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's impossible to hold it for a long time.

479
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll hold it for a long time.

480
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That was a waste of time.

481
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Punch and Punch!

482
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes!

483
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
One more time!

484
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes!

485
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Everyone, get ready!

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go!

487
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Go!

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Go!

489
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Go!

490
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Go!

491
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Go!

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Go!

493
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Go!

494
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Go!

495
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Go!

496
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Go!

497
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's going to be fine.

498
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Come toweight

499
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Punch and Punch!

500
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes!

501
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Punch and Punch!

502
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's okay if it suddenly stops.

503
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Stop it! Stop it!

504
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Stop it! Stop it!

505
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Stop it! Stop it!

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Start!

507
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Miyasako!

508
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Nice! Nice!

509
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He's sleeping.

510
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Nice! Nice!

511
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Miyasako!

512
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's go!

513
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
End!

514
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Kimura!

515
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
One point difference!

516
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Ready! Start!

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Go! Go!

518
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
End!

519
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He's fast!

520
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He's fast!

521
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He's fast!

522
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He's fast!

523
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He's fast!

524
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He's fast!

525
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He's fast!

526
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He's fast!

527
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He's fast!

528
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He's fast!

529
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He's fast!

530
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He's fast!

531
00:19:38,000 --> 00:20:02,000
3...2...

532
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let him be!

533
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We are super businesses...

534
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Fight!

535
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,500
Hey, hey, hey, don't cut it!

536
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's enough!

537
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
You excited, seguir?

538
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
S... S... S...

539
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Cook...

540
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't want to, cook me some more!

541
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm not asking you to cook!

542
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry!

543
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry!

544
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What are you doing?

545
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry!

546
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm sorry!

547
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay! Okay!

548
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry!

549
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm sorry!

550
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
End!

551
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What's with this picture?

552
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's 1 to 1.

553
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
1 to 1.

554
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But we did the ending until the end.

555
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's right. I think we won somehow.

556
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But Tanaka lost.

557
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So it's a tie.

558
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's a draw.

559
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So it's 1 win, 2 losses, 1 draw.

560
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
At this point, we don't have to do the downtown show anymore.

561
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What?

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We still have time, so we'll do our best.

563
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Wait a minute!

564
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There's still a lot of young people left.

565
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's okay to do that.

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a long story.

567
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey!

568
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You guys are telling me this early.

569
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey!

570
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What should we do?

571
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Nothing.

572
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You're in a lot of trouble.

573
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What are you going to do?

574
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What should we do?

575
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Just do it yourself.

576
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What should we do?

577
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But we still have to do the downtown show.

578
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's right. We've been fighting for a long time.

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Please do it one more time.

580
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Please.

581
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We'll do it for real.

582
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We'll do it properly.

583
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Please.

584
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What do you think?

585
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm serious.

586
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's do it separately.

587
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's do it separately.

588
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Is that okay?

589
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's light.

590
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's light.

591
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thank you very much.

592
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you very much.
