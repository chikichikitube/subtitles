1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I went to Sendai.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the New Year.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the New Year.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When I went to Sendai, it snowed a lot that night.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Kim, Itao and the three of us.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We didn't think it was that cold, so the three of us wore slippers.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We didn't buy cigarettes.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When we arrived, it was normal in Sendai.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Everyone was walking around in slippers.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It snowed a lot at night.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I went to eat and went out of the hotel, it snowed a lot.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The three of us.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We couldn't walk like this.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We couldn't walk like this.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The three of us had to walk vertically from top to bottom.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Up and down.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We had to walk up and down.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We couldn't move.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We had to stand a little.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It would be nice if we could walk like this.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, no, no.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't want to buy shoes on a trip, do you?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Even in the summer.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I thought I forgot to say Beach Zori.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, it's Beach Zori.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wait, wait.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's Beach Zori.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Beach Zori.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't want to go to the beach with you.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to take you home.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's the same thing.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It was hard.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We were in most hotels.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I watched TV on New Year's Eve.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Was it fun?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Everyone is funny now.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Everyone is funny.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But the funniest person is...

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The funniest person is...

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The funniest person is...

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Kubota Toshinobu.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What commercial?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's amazing.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't take off one or two lines.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think I took off red and yellow.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's just white.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Half and half.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you singing?

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm surprised.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
5, 4, 3.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Half and half.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He can't do it.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If he did it, it would be cold.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's cold.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think the staff around him would say,

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's cold.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think so.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He doesn't think it's cold.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He doesn't think it's cold.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If he's cold, it's getting colder and colder.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's getting cold.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You have to get in.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think I was in the dressing room for about 30 minutes.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I tried not to move my head.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I tried not to move my head.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If I moved my head, I would fall.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was told,

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was told,

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Half and half.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Half and half.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't be mean.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When I first saw it, I thought it was cold.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I thought it was stupid.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, no, no.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He's doing a good job.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to tell you a little bit.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The most annoying thing in the commercial is,

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think it's Suzuki Ganran.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ishiya.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not that bad up to here.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ishiya, half and half.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's okay here, too.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's sold out.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's here.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's here.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's useless.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's a nut for the locker.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The one that tightens it like this.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The screw is like this.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you do this,

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you do this,

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's what you want to do.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I've never written it down.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've never written it down.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm so pissed off.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I haven't even played with you.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't help but look at you when you're so pissed off.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, I don't think so.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm so pissed off.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You know, there are a lot of talented people...

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Umm...

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What?

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When I'm told that I live here, I'm so pissed off.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Why?

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Of course I am!

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why haven't you moved to Osaka yet?

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who told you that?

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm so pissed off.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, I'm so pissed off.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not pissed off!

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, I don't think you're a Tokyo talent.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're so twisted!

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm so pissed off.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know, it's like asking if I'm still in the theater.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm so pissed off.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm so pissed off.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is the end of the story.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is the end of the story.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What?

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is the end of the story.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is the end of the story.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What?

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is the end of the story.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You have been able to make a lot of predictions, like the lack of glasses, the rise of the meteor, and the suspension of the volcano.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The year 1997 has started, but let's hear your predictions for this year.

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's getting older every year.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But the genre is...

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think it's better for everyone to listen and be interested.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I think it's better for everyone to listen and be interested.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
About the entertainment world.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
By the way, I was talking about the entertainment world and it was exciting.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There are a lot of entertainers, right?

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There are a lot of entertainers, right?

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There are a lot of entertainers, right?

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Everyone wants to be a couple.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Who is left?

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I see.

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm probably Maeda Bivalia.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know what Maeda Bivalia is doing.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone is holding hands and sitting down.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It can't be helped. I'll sit down and connect with you.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go to the party.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who will go to the party?

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll go to the party.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll go to the party.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sure I'll be the same as Maeda Bivalia.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sure I'll be the same as Maeda Bivalia.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's strange to be Maeda Bivalia.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Everyone else is Baer, right?

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There are a lot of people who say that.

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They say it's interesting.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They come to see us.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Surprisingly, Kai-san is the only one who doesn't know what to do.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Kai Yoshihiro is the only one who doesn't know what to do.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The other day, Komoro-san made a song and we all sang it together.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Kai-san was in it, right?

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Kai-san was in it.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Kai-san is in it, right?

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's in it.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Kai-san will never break his back.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He's running around.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He's running around a lot.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was the last one to go to the toilet.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was the last one to go to the toilet after everyone's song.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please let me hear it.

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The one that everyone is connected to.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's okay.

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Someone was singing my part.

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was listening to it.

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Huh?

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is this Kai-san?

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah!

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think it's similar.

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've seen a lot of shows like this.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Kai-san!

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No!

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Kai-san is an interesting person.

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think Kai-san will never break his back.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I think he'll die.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But I can't help it.

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In the end, he's like Yuki-san's older sister.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you doing?

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's what he said.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What are you doing?

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What are you doing?

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you doing?

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm an entertainer.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Everyone can be surprised.

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Can I say this?

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Did you know about Seiko-chan the other day?

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I knew.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's why I said it last year.

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You didn't say it!

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What are you talking about?

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who's getting a divorce?

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Huh?

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Divorce?

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What's the point of getting a divorce in the entertainment world?

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Divorce is...

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's unpleasant, isn't it?

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's the first time I've seen it.

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, don't speed up!

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Matsumoto-san used to be on the ranger stage.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Please tell us Matsumoto-san's performance on that stage.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're the one who got off the helicopter.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I got off the helicopter and shot like this.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Where did you do that?

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Over there.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know, right?

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where did you do that?

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What?

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Where did you do that?

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Afghan.

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Afghan?

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What the hell are you talking about?

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why are you talking about Afghanistan?

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was told to sing and dance in Afghan.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You even sang.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
At night.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
At karaoke.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Please tell us Matsumoto-san's performance.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There were a lot of things.

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was often asked to help people.

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have 8 licenses.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Please tell us.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If I don't have 8 licenses, I won't be able to join the special forces.

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
First of all, I have a normal license.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's right.

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If I have a normal license, I can ride a motorcycle.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You can ride a motorcycle.

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can ride a motorcycle.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I have two.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You don't have to be on the ranger stage.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you ask me to bring you something, I'll take a motorcycle.

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You don't have to be on the ranger stage at a time like this, do you?

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't mind.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I also have a boiler.

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What?

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
A boiler.

251
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What?

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A boiler.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I see.

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm a boiler man.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I see.

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
A boiler.

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's it.

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You still have more.

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I have 8 licenses.

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I still have more.

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What is it?

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Next to the boiler.

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Welding.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is the brand of the tank.

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's your job, isn't it?

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have to bring it to someone and do it.

267
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You don't have to tell me how to do it.

268
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is like this.

269
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There are times when this is broken.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't think you know.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know.

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Welding.

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Welding.

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Welding.

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I also have a kind license.

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll try to save you once.

277
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You don't have a kind license.

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This was the most difficult for me.

279
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Really.

280
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because there was a technique.

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Kind license.

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What do you do?

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I gave a balloon to a child.

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I saw the instructor all the way.

285
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Please tell me how to do it.

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's not the point.

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's not a lot of fighting going on.

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, I see.

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
More than that, for example, the oil leak in the tanker caused a lot of trouble.

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I went to help Anna.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I see.

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
There were a lot of activities like that.

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I see.

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The most memorable thing for me was the night in Yamaguchi.

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What was the situation like?

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What?

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What was the situation like?

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I was floating on a helicopter.

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Floating?

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes, I was floating.

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, I see.

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You were floating on a helicopter.

303
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You were flying, weren't you?

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, I was.

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I see.

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I see.

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I was flying.

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Bambi was in the valley.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
On the valley floor.

311
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Which way?

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
On the valley floor.

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Which way?

314
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
On the valley floor or on the valley floor?

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
On the valley floor?

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes, there was a rabbit on the valley floor.

317
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Bambi was there?

318
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, Bambi was there.

319
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Bambi was there.

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Bambi was flying like this.

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He wasn't born yet, was he?

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He wasn't born yet, was he?

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, I see.

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I said, Bambi!

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I said, I found Bambi!

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I said, Matsumoto, do it for me!

327
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I said, Matsumoto, do it for me!

328
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's what I said.

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You were the only one there.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So I steered the car automatically.

331
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We steered the car automatically,

332
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
so we Sharped the helicopter.

333
00:13:42,000 --> 00:14:00,880
Otherwise I had

334
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,880
I don't know. I don't know how to do it.

335
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
When I go like this, I can touch the head.

336
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I want to grab it, but I can only touch the head like this.

337
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
That's the limit.

338
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
I shake it like this.

339
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
I forgot.

340
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,880
No, no, no.

341
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I go like this.

342
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
I shake it like this.

343
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:55,880
No, no, no.
