00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Hizou the Kid. Unpublished talk show.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
When your butt gets itchy in the city, how do you draw without being noticed by the people around you?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Or how do you draw your butt so it's not embarrassing to be noticed?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Have you ever had your butt itchy while walking around the city?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You have, right?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why is it itchy in the city?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's still itchy, right?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is it itchy because it's still itchy?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Or is it not itchy?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you put poop on your butt, it's itchy, right?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's itchy, right?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So is your butt itchy?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or is it the other way around?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't know if it's the other way around or not.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't people cheat and do that?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No one does that.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They do it across the chain.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Isn't that embarrassing?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why is that?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The chain is like this, right?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In a circle.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Even if it's like this, it's not like that all over the place.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You have to look for it when you draw.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Women can't do it like this.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why? You can do it, right?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The chain.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Please tell me a way that's not embarrassing.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, I got it. I'll tell you.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is pretty rough.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're walking, right?

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Where are you walking?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's better to be in a crowded place.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Shinjuku?

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In Shinjuku or anywhere in the city.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Your butt got itchy in Shinjuku.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please look for a alley somewhere.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Go into the alley.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why is it open again?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm just answering the questions.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't mean it.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you don't want to go into the alley, anyone can do it.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm just saying.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't mean it.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why is it open again?

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why is it open again?

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I didn't mean to answer all the questions.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have a question for Bruce's queen, Matsumoto-san.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How can you sing like Matsumoto-san?

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bruce is very difficult.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There's a lot of things.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There's a lot of things?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's a lot of difficult things.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Isn't Bruce's queen a ***?

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, that's what happened to him.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's not what happened.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's a genius.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He's a genius.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He held my hand and said it with tears in his eyes.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then he said he'd leave it to me.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What? He was saying something nice.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, well, well, well, it's you.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was you.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't make a fool of yourself.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, no.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Who is Bruce?

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sure there were a lot of people.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
As a result, it was you.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It was you.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I said it twice.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I said it twice.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Bruce is not a good singer.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's one thing I can say.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Bruce is not a good singer.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's just like he usually is.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just like he usually is?

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's why...

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
When I pour hot water from the pot,

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think, oh, it's Bruce.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Even when I see a dog,

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I think, oh, it's Bruce.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What kind of condition is that?

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Bruce.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Bruce, here you go.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What do you mean by Bruce?

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You don't even know what Bruce is.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I've been talking about Bruce all this time.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, I'm asking why you can sing like that.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you can sing like that,

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you know this is Bruce.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sleepy.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Bruce...

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Bruce, what kind of condition is that?

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You don't even know what Bruce is.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When Hama-chan got injured

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and was about to come back to life,

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
he gave an unrevealed talk.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's talk about an animal

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that has a toilet in the Mutsugoro Kingdom of Hokkaido.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Recently, a stray cat in the neighborhood

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
is trying to poop in our garden.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is there any good way to do that?

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There's something you can do to keep it from getting drunk.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is it a PET bottle?

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a PET bottle, but it's something you can leave behind.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't have one?

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What do you mean?

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's something you can leave behind if you don't want it.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The best thing is dog poop.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There's dog poop in the garden.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But why do you have to cover it up?

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Think about it.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Imagine you're a cat.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You hate dogs.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you go there, there's poop too.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You would never go there.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you really hate dogs?

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Of course not.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They can poop in the garden.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And if you ask them, they'll say it's dog poop.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who would go there?

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's what cats think.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's what cats think.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's something you can do to keep it from getting drunk.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's something you can leave behind.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Really?

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Cats don't know what a PET bottle is.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Of course they don't.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's that?

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's something you can leave behind if you don't want it.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Cats run away when they see light?

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then what about my star shine?

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Toshi-chan.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lastly, let's hear from the two people who couldn't show their stars last week.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's a legend that the store you went to will definitely go bankrupt.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's true.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't get it.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's true.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll tell you a small story.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If I go to a place where there aren't any people and eat there, I'll get drunk.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's true.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Isn't it?

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's true.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But it's amazing.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's completely different from you.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When you were sitting down, your seat was full, right?

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
When I was eating, it was amazing.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There were people lined up outside.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There weren't any people until a while ago, but there were people lined up outside.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Outside?

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where did they come from?

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was amazing.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There were people who wanted to work part-time.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They even saved the old man.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The old lady at the park was like,

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The other day, I was beaten up by a bar.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm very sad about it.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Please tell me how to distinguish a bar from a bar.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you see a bar and think it's bad, please tell me.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
To be honest, even if I use my foresight,

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't tell just by looking at the door.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't tell?

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can't tell just by looking at the door.

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But if you go inside, you can tell right away.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But if I go inside, I can't tell.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It happens a lot.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
People use their cell phones.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They go outside and say,

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hello?

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then they go out.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Outside.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But they can't go back inside.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So if you go inside...

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are a lot of people who run away.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is that so?

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If you go inside, how do you tell which one is bad?

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Checkpoints.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Checkpoints.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
First, on the counter,

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
there's an old woman who has a lot of meaning.

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She's a fortune teller.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not interested.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How many years has it been?

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm not interested in that.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There's an old woman who has a lot of meaning.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When you need to pay,

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
if you say, I don't have that kind of money,

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you'll be in trouble.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Just leave it like that.

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's what I'm talking about.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you do that, you'll be in trouble.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't you leave before that happens?

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, there are a lot of things...

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you so quiet?

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Say it louder.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There are a lot of checkpoints.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're kidding, right?

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There are a lot of things, right?

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There are.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Just say it.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Just say it.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Seriously.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Seriously?

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
With your eyes.

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When you first enter,

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
it'll be about 1 o'clock.

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I see.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I understand that.

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then...

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There are no checkpoints.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There are no checkpoints.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Everyone...

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone's close.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't care.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It looks fun.

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you doing?

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What?

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you doing?

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Can you do it?

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What kind of attitude is that?

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Can you do it?

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What kind of attitude is that?

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How can you do that?

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What kind of attitude is that?

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I apologize.

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That was a bad way to say it.

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm in a bad mood.

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There are still a lot of things.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I apologize.

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you look at me like that,

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't have the courage to say anything.

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What kind of attitude was that?

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't want to say that.

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This program was brought to you

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:57,000
