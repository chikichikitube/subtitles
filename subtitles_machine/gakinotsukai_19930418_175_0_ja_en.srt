When you reach 5 people, that person will be the target.

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,320
Let's get started!

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Here is the first question!

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Here!

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Don't look!

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,320
A sports player who used to be bullied.

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Who is a sports player?

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
When I was a kid.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,320
I was bullied by my friends.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
I was told to go home early and cool down my hair.

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
I was told to do such a thing.

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,320
That's what I thought.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Please write it down!

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
I don't know.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
I'll write it down.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
The sound is playing.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Who is it?

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
It's dirty.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,320
3, 2, 1, 3.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
No, no, no.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
Let's start with Mr. Otake.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Here is the song.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Here is the song.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes, yes, yes.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
He is a tricky person.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I was bullied in the past.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I know.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
3.

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
I think this is possible.

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
4.

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
It's quite...

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Write it down in kanji!

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,320
I think I was bullied when I was in elementary school.

49
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Mr. Otake.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Yes.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
It's funny.

52
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
This is what you think.

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
No, no, no.

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
3, 2, 1.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Kenji Inuma's wife.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
That's...

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
It's funny.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
It's funny.

59
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
That's...

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
That's...

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
That's...

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Wait a minute.

64
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
That's...

65
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
So how were you bullied?

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
That's right.

68
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,320
There is no such thing as bullying in this era.

69
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Not really.

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
What is that?

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I wasn't bullied in the past.

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
That's why...

73
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Well...

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,320
If you were bullied in the past, it would be Ito Midori.

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Kuwata.

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Ito Midori.

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
The younger brother of the marathon.

78
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Kiyowa.

79
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Furuta.

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Mr. Kuwata.

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Mr. mug.

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Motoki Daisuke.

83
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Kuwata.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm kind of weak.

85
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Ito Midori.

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Nakashima Kazushige.

87
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Ito Midori.

88
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Ito Midori.

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Kyojin Kazushige.

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Kyojin Kazushige.

91
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
him auf Nagashima.

92
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Ok, here I have the leader of Kattan-chan

93
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Mr. Nagashima Kazushige!

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Mr. Ito Midori is in third place.

95
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
And Kuwata.

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
He's not in third place at all.

97
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
And the Sō brothers.

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Oh, really?

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
And the next question is...

100
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
This one!

101
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
The Owarashi talent that just happened to sell!

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,320
You just happened to sell, didn't you!

103
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,320
You're really funny!

104
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,320
There's no answer like this, is there?

105
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
No, no, that's not it.

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I'll give you 5,000 yen later.

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Don't give me that kind of money!

108
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
But I don't know if it's selling.

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
You don't know if it's selling, do you?

110
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,320
There's a lot of people who don't know if it's selling or not.

111
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Hey!

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Where are you looking at?

113
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I don't know!

114
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Let me participate! Let me participate!

115
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Let's draw it. Here you go.

116
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Did you go to elementary school properly?

117
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
It's dirty, isn't it?

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
It's dirty, isn't it?

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,320
What you're drawing is dirty.

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Oh, that's it.

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
I think so, too.

122
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I love you.

123
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
It's the last one!

124
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
What?

125
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Hurry up with that! Hurry up with that!

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Let's start with Otagai.

127
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Moriaki-kun!

128
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Hey! Everyone's doing it with Hama!

129
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Hama-chan said,

130
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I'm on the same side as you!

131
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Don't cut it!

132
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Don't cut it!

133
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Let's go with Isamu-san.

134
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
One, two, three!

135
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Yamada-kun, I'm sorry!

136
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Yamada-kun!

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
But I don't think so.

138
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Well, let's say it's possible.

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Let's say it's possible.

140
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Let's go with Mano-san.

141
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
No, no, no!

142
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Wait a minute!

143
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Wait a minute!

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Wait!

145
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
No, no, no!

146
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
No, no, no!

147
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
What?

148
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Let's play!

149
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Downtown?

150
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
That's a lot.

Jimmy Onishi?

157
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Uchano-chan.

158
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
He looks like an amateur.

159
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
He's not that cool.

160
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Dachau Club.

161
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320

165
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Uchano-chan.

166
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
He looks like an amateur.

167
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Jimmy Onishi?

168
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Paul McKee.

169
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320

Uchano-chan.

171
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Dachau Club.

172
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I don't think he's boring.

173
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Uchano-chan.

174
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320

Dachau Club.

181
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Uchano-chan.

182
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,320
The winner is Uchano-chan!

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
What?

184
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
What are you doing?

185
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I don't know what you're doing.

186
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
The next question is...

187
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,320
This one!

188
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Tama-kun!

189
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Why are you in the train?

190
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Why do you look like that?

191
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Dekkan-chan!

192
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Why do you have a bag up to here?

193
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
That's it.

194
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I can't believe it.

195
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Next question, please!

196
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Sayu-san.

197
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
It's a man, isn't it?

198
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
It's a man.

199
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Of course, it's a woman.

200
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
It's a woman, isn't it?

201
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Otake-san.

202
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Otake-san.

203
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
The answer is...

204
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
The exit.

205
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
You guys are amazing.

206
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Please show us another one.

207
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Another one?

208
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Another one is here.

209
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
That's why I can't appear in dramas anymore.

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Next, Anno-san.

211
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
This one.

212
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Karasawa, right?

213
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Yes, Karasawa.

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
It's that one, isn't it?

215
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
The one who appears in a tea commercial.

216
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
The one who dances.

217
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Next, Sano-san.

218
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes.

219
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
It's Akiyuki-san.

220
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
The one who has a horn here.

221
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I saw him when I was watching a drama.

222
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Taishu Kase.

223
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Mokkun?

224
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
No, Karasawa.

225
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Taishu Kase.

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
He has a good figure.

227
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Taishu Kase?

228
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
He's strong.

229
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Taishu Kase.

230
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
The one with a big nose.

231
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
The one with a big mouth.

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Shunichi Ishida.

233
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Yoshida Yusaku.

234
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Oda Yuji?

235
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Shunichi Ishida?

236
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
It's Yoshida Yusaku.

237
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I think he's really big.

238
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Kazama Thor?

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Azuma Miki?

240
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Shunichi Ishida.

241
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
It's Yoshida Yusaku.

242
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
The one who looks strong.

243
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Shunichi Ishida?

244
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
It's Yoshida Yusaku.

245
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
It has to be Yoshida Yusaku.

246
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
The one with a big nose.

247
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Yoshida Yusaku-san.

248
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
The one with a big nose.

249
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Yoshida Yusaku, Shunichi Ishida, Taishu Kase, Azuma Miki-san.

250
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
The one with a big nose.

251
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Is it in?

252
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Don't look at me like that.

253
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:09,320
The last question is...

254
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,320
A foreign talent who looks like he has corn in his poop.

255
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Your grandma is a dirty grandma!

256
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You can't get corn in your poop!

257
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Call the person who came up with this.

258
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Write down the answer with your right hand.

259
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Here you go.

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm sure you'll get it.

261
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
I think you'll get it.

262
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
It's a foreign talent.

263
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:53,320
One, two, three, four...

264
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Who wrote the foreign talent?

265
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Write it down!

266
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Let's start with Mr. Otake.

267
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Don!

268
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
This is Kento.

269
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
He's got corn in his poop.

270
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I'll leave it to you.

271
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Isamu-san, I'm sure you'll get this one.

272
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Yes.

273
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Three.

274
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm sure you'll get this one.

275
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm sure I'll get this one, too.

276
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Masao-san.

277
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
I have a feeling you'll get this one.

278
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
I don't think I'll get it.

279
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
But...

280
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I have a feeling you'll get this one.

281
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Kento.

282
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Delicato.

283
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Yes.

284
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I think I'll get Chuck.

285
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Schwarzenegger.

286
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Dave Spector.

287
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
The hair is like this.

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Kento.

289
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Delicato.

290
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Sankon-san.

291
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Michael Douglas.

292
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Dave Spector.

293
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
It's like this.

294
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Sankon-san.

295
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Sankon-san.

296
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Sankon-san.

297
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Hibinkotsuna.

298
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I think I'll get corn.

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Tom Cruise.

300
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Ben Johnson.

301
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I think I'll get anything.

302
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Hibinkotsuna.

303
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Akebono.

304
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Schwarzenegger.

305
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,320
I don't think I'll get it.

306
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Kento.

307
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Delicato.

308
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Kento.

309
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Delicato.

310
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Sankon-san.

311
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
The winner is Sankon-san.

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I got this one for the first time.

313
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
I got it.

314
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Yes.

315
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Sankon-san.

316
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
The winner is Sankon-san.

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Ladies and gentlemen.

318
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Let's start.

319
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
The winner is Sankon-san.

320
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Sankon-san.

321
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
The audience treats you like Furuyo-chan.

322
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Really?

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Yes.

324
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,320
The only person who laughs at me is Furuyo-chan.

325
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I've been doing this program all the time.

326
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
The broadcasting time.

327
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
The broadcasting time.

328
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm finally going back to normal from this week.

329
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Really?

330
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm glad to hear that.

331
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,320
There were so many special programs in the morning.

332
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Really?

333
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
There were so many.

334
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
What?

335
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I was caught by Mutsugoro.

336
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Mutsugoro is good.

337
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Why?

338
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
I've told you many times.

339
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Don't be fooled by that old man.

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I told you to wake up.

341
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
I've been doing it over and over again.

342
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I don't think there's anything wrong with Mutsugoro.

343
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
You're so angry.

344
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,320
I'm not a fan of Mutsugoro.

345
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
You're a fan of animals.

346
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
That's right.

347
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm not a fan of Mutsugoro.

348
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I don't think there's anything wrong with Mutsugoro.

349
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Mutsugoro is walking around Shinjuku.

350
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Mutsugoro.

351
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
There's no one who says,

352
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Mutsugoro, come here and give me a hand.

353
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
There's someone like that.

354
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
I don't think there's anyone like that.

355
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
If that's the case,

356
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Mutsugoro is better.

357
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Mutsugoro.

358
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I don't know.

359
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
The world of TV.

360
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I don't think it's good.

361
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I don't think it's good.

362
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Touch it.

363
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
It's a round shape today.

364
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
You can wear a suit like usual.

365
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I don't care if you stick your hand in your pocket.

366
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
You're here.

367
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Tell me.

368
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I don't think it's good.

369
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
I'm going home.

370
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
That's right.

371
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't wash yourself.

372
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
If you do it, wash it.

373
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
That's right.

374
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
That's enough.

375
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
I won't wash it.

376
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I can't even blow it.

377
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm scared of women.

378
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
If you think you're blowing it,

379
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
It's got tissue on it.

380
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
What are you pulling?

381
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
I don't know.

382
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I can't help pulling it.

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Tommy is getting worse these days.

384
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
That's not true.

385
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
It's normal in our conversation.

386
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
I don't talk like that.

387
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
That's right.

388
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
You really don't do it.

389
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
The girl on the staff.

390
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
From behind.

391
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Momono.

392
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
You really don't do it.

393
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Why?

394
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Why?

395
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
You said that, too.

396
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,320
There's a man on the show that I've been working with since I was a kid.

397
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
She's also a human being in this world.

398
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
But if you do this,

399
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I don't know if she's going to go out with him.

400
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
In front of this man,

401
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I can't stand it.

402
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
If it's this man,

403
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I can't stand it.

404
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Hama-chan is mine.

405
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
He's my father.

406
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
He's my father.

407
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Even if it's a boy or a girl,

408
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
He's not my father.

409
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,320
But he's definitely my boyfriend.

410
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
To be honest,

411
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
I've done it a few times, too.

412
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
You're lying.

413
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
It's true.

414
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,320
It's true.

415
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
To be honest,

416
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I've done it a few times, too.

417
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Hama-chan, stop it.

418
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
You're the only one who can do it.

419
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Inawara, come over here.

420
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Come on, come on, come on.

421
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Do something.

422
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
You're so good at it.

423
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
What?

424
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
It's the first time you've followed me.

425
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Of course.

426
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
I didn't know that.

427
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
You have to be careful.

428
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
I'll be careful.

429
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,320
You should stop asking questions about other women.

430
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I got it.

431
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
I haven't done it lately.

432
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I don't think you can see anything.

433
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
What do you mean?

434
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
You're in the middle of something.

435
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Why?

436
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
This is a serious story.

437
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Sometimes I'm in the middle of something.

438
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,320
I'm smoking a cigarette.

439
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
I hear a woman's voice.

440
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
I'm in the middle of something.

441
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,320
I'm in the middle of something.

442
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,320
I'm in the middle of something.

443
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
There's an Clay Symbol.

444
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,320
I'll appear on TV.

445
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Everyoneайs laughing.

446
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,320
It's funny.

447
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
For example, when you see someone and say,

448
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Stop it.

449
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Don't do it!

450
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
About Heikin

451
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,320
In the last week's broadcast, Hama-chan talked about Macchan 15 times.

452
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Only the broadcasted part is 15 times.

453
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
If you put in the part that is not broadcasted, I think it will be more.

454
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Good luck, Macchan!

455
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Is that so?

456
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Is that so?

457
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
No, that's a great number.

458
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
If you think about it until now.

459
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
So it's 15 times only last week.

460
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
If you put in the part that is not broadcasted, I think it will be about 30 times.

461
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
How many times have you done 30 times in this program?

462
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
It's 174 times!

463
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
30 times 174.

464
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Even if you do it lightly.

465
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
It's a great number.

466
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
What are you talking about?

467
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
I understand.

468
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
But I can say this like a joke.

469
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,320
If you are hit this much, after all, when it is about 70 or 80, the side effect will definitely come out.

470
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
I'm not talking about side effects.

471
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm talking about side effects.

472
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Did you drink something?

473
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Something will come out.

474
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
It's like a boxer.

475
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
That's right.

476
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
What should I do?

477
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Last week.

478
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
The other day.

479
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
My friend.

480
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
That's right.

481
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
The costume is already like this.

482
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Last week.

484
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
The other day.

485
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
I don't like it.

486
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Don't do it!

487
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
You.

488
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Don't come right away.

489
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,320
The other day, my friend called me and asked me if I could get someone from Yoshimoto to come to the university festival.

490
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Koji Imada and someone told me that it was 600,000 yen.

491
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,320
I thought Koji Imada was more expensive.

492
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
This picture means that.

493
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
A picture that is expensive?

494
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
That's cheap.

495
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
It's 600,000 yen.

496
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
And I'm not alone yet.

497
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Even if you read Hote Toro, it costs 50,000 yen.

498
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
The content of the job is different.

499
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Do you go to the university festival?

500
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Sometimes.

501
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
I don't go to the university festival at all.

502
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,320
I don't think the company will accept it.

503
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I went to the university festival last year, too.

504
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,320
How many times did you go to the university festival?

505
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
That's what we say.

506
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
I'll tell you the price here.

507
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,320
I called Yoshimoto and told him that I saw a child's teacher.

508
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
How many times did you go to the university festival?

509
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Why are you telling me?

510
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
You tell me yourself.

511
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I'll tell you the price.

512
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I don't go to the university festival in Japan.

513
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
2,000,000 yen?

514
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Yes.

515
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Do you call a person with 2,000,000 yen?

516
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Yes.

517
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I'm wearing this again.

518
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
What is it?

519
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Atsuko Asano was doing a live-action version of Mr. Sadai.

520
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
What kind of live-action version do you want to see?

521
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
There was a long time ago.

522
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
The Queen of Tomorrow.

523
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Who is playing the Queen of Tomorrow?

524
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Is it Shoji Ishibashi?

525
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
In a live-action version.

526
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Superman.

527
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,320
If a Japanese person plays Superman, it's Shinichi Chiba, isn't it?

528
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Is that so?

529
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
I don't think there's anyone else.

530
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
I think it would be better to have someone who's more aggressive.

531
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Who is it?

532
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Konytan?

533
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Konytan is good.

534
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Konytan is good.

535
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Who did Senzai Bakabon?

536
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
My Yamada Arako.

537
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Bakabon.

538
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
You can do Bakabon.

539
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Hajime Ingen Gyatob.

540
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Hajime Kurano.

541
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Doteijin is Kuruma Sankichi.

542
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
That's right.

543
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm addicted to it.

544
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm thinking about it.

545
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I'm thinking about it.

546
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
There's nothing I can do.

547
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Is that so?

548
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Yes.

549
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Then I'll win.

550
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,320
You can make a monster.
