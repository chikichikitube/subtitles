1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yoh-kan, Yoh-kan, Yoh-kan

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yoh-kan Kusai wa Nakayoshi da

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Itsumo Futari de Mitsu Yoh-kan

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yoh-kan no Tanna

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yoh-kan no Yome

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yoru wa Kuri Yoh-kan

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
HON-HON!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yoh-san joined us today as well.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How is it, seeing Dantan for the first time?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even if it's not the first time, there are people like that.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But it's not the first time at all.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Ah, is that so?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When you experience it, it's surprisingly...

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It must be smelly, right?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's smelly, right?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's smelly, right?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Really, it's really...

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're very charismatic, aren't you?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think you have a lot of thoughts.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because when you see a talent for the first time, you have a lot of thoughts, don't you?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I wonder if it's okay to be happy about it.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's okay to be happy about it.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's okay to be happy about 6-4, isn't it?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Eh? 6 is normal?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's okay to be happy about 6.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ah, is that so?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are things like that, but...

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I, you know...

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I discovered a lot of things.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I was able to make a good reason for it.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you listen to this story, I think everyone will think,

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, Matsumoto is really amazing.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I think you'll be able to think like that.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah, I see.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you want to hear that story?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Actually, he said it because he wanted to.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, I really want to hear it.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well...

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
UFO.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
UFO.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Time machine theory.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's something that can be said.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
By who?

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
By me.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
By me?

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
By me?

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's something that I can say.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you listen to this story, you'll think,

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ah, Matsumoto has started again.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This guy is completely crazy.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He wants to come out of the ***.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You think so, don't you?

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But this is amazing.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's different.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is different.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's easy to understand.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, according to my theory,

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Everyone often talks about aliens,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but there is no such thing as aliens.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Aliens are future people.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can call them aliens.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But future people are aliens,

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and aliens are future people.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you understand?

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I clearly understood this.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I clearly understood this.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why is it so...

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's like a world of loneliness.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why is it like a world of loneliness?

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please come in more.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You understood that, didn't you?

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I understood that.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I see.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't understand anything.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You don't understand anything.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What kind of place is it?

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I sometimes see UFOs.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, not often.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I come to see UFOs.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's impossible for UFOs to attack earthlings.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I see.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In the end, they will kill us.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If they attack earthlings and kill them,

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the history will be messed up.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There is a possibility that our existence will disappear.

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In movies, aliens often attack earthlings,

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but there is absolutely no such thing.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I see.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is it this time?

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am waiting for the end of the war.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Shut up.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I understand.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am listening to you seriously.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Speak.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My friend's mother saw a huge UFO during the war.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What do you mean by huge?

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
During the war,

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
when there was a lot of air raid,

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
there were a lot of UFOs.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That means there are a lot of UFOs.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's huge.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's huge.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I saw it almost every day at that time.

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I haven't seen it recently.

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The reason is that I came to see it.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I came to see the war.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I came to see World War II.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
UFOs are sightseeing.

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In the future, there will be a travel agency.

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you ask me where I want to see it,

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I will say it's a war.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is called Hawaii.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It is the most difficult thing to see a war.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
As a UFO.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because everyone is running away.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Even if you see a UFO, you can't help it.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's why there were a lot of UFOs during the war.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do you understand that?

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can follow me up to this point.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After the UFO fell,

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I became a captured alien.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Annan has already been decided.

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will definitely...

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why did you become 36 years old and step on the box?

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Please continue my story.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please shorten the tempo a little more.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I want to travel by UFO.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you want to go to the past,

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please follow the rules.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There is a rule that you should not get off.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you get off and have contact, it will be strange.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But what is it?

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There are times when an old man goes abroad and becomes drunk and strange.

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In this way, you can remove the feeling of traveling.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So the captured alien is drunk.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's like, no, no, no!

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Swing monster!

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a bloody leg.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because it's a bloody leg, it's both sides.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Finally, the cold day came and I was told to go home.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There is no doubt.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you have any comments on this matter?

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,500
No.

147
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Wow!

148
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Wow!

149
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
It's a fun theory.

150
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,000
But I think it's definitely true.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,500
There's no mistake about this.

152
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Why is everyone smiling?

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
The storm of failure.

154
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Failure. Failure. Failure.

155
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Smile of love.

156
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Well then.

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
There's a lot of things we have to do today.

158
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
First of all, let's have a match.

159
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
That's fine.

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Let's call the Hamada team.

161
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
That's fine.

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:27,500
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

163
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Are you ready, Mr. Matsumoto?

164
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Yes.

165
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
This time, it's a four-man vs. one-man match.

166
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
It's one-on-one.

167
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Yes, yes.

168
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
We've decided that it's one-on-one 100m.

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Yes, yes.

170
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
This time, our staff is going to do a simulation.

171
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Oh.

172
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
This is Tanaka.

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Yes.

174
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
This is Endo.

175
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
This is Yamasaki.

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
This is me.

177
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,500
We're going to do a simulation.

178
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Please take a look.

179
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Yes, yes.

180
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Please.

181
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
This is Yamasaki.

182
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Yes.

183
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh, that's it?

184
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Yamasaki.

185
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Oh, that's it?

186
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
This is Tanaka.

187
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Tanaka.

188
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
This is Tanaka.

189
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Tanaka.

190
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Yes.

191
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
This is Endo.

192
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Is this me?

193
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
This is completely different.

194
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
This is half a year later.

195
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
It's been half a year.

196
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
This is me.

197
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
The Hamada team is completely different.

198
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Oh, poor guy.

199
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Oh, Numa.

200
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Why is it Oh, Numa?

201
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
It's crazy.

202
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Why is it up?

203
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
It's up.

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
This is Mazo.

205
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Yes.

206
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
That's good.

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
It's amazing that Sugata-san just came out.

208
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Sugata-san is already used to it.

209
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
That's right.

210
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Sugata-san is not a skirt.

211
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
The first time, each of the four is running 25 meters.

212
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Yes.

213
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
That's 100 meters.

214
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I see.

215
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Passing the baton.

216
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
This is the first time.

217
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Yes.

218
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Next.

219
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Let's see.

220
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Ready.

221
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
First of all, Yamazaki-san.

222
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
This is Yamazaki.

223
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Yamazaki.

224
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
This is me.

225
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
This is Endo.

226
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Endo is fast.

227
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
This is Tanaka.

228
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
This is Tanaka.

229
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
This is a good match.

230
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
This is a good match.

231
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Wow.

232
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Wow.

233
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Wow.

234
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Yes.

235
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Yes, Numa.

236
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Yes.

237
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Numa is the same.

238
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Are you kidding me?

239
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
This is a good match.

240
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
This is 25 meters.

241
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
That's why.

242
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Sugata-san.

243
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Sugata-san.

244
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
The second time.

245
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Yes.

246
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
This is 20 meters.

247
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
The last time is 40 meters.

248
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Yes.

249
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Hamada-san is 40 meters.

250
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Hamada is 40 meters.

251
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Yamazaki, Endo, Tanaka, me.

252
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
In this order.

253
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Pay attention.

254
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
2, 2, 2, 4.

255
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Ready.

256
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
He didn't raise his thighs.

257
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
But this is slow.

258
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
It's 20 meters. It's short.

259
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
This is Baton.

260
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm Baton.

261
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
He is laughing.

262
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Seriously.

263
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
But this is close.

264
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
He is laughing.

265
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
What happened?

266
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
He looks like a murderer.

267
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
He is smoking.

268
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
He is smoking.

269
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
He is smoking.

270
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Next.

271
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
The first time is 94 meters.

272
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I see.

273
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
The last time is 2, 2, 2.

274
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Hamada, Yamazaki, Tanaka, Endo.

275
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes.

276
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
This is...

277
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Hamada-san and Matsumoto-san.

278
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Hamada and I ran 94 meters first.

279
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
94.

280
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
At the next step.

281
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I see.

282
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
This is...

283
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I see.

284
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,500
2 meters, 2 meters.

285
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
That was close.

286
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
That's why.

287
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
It's important.

288
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
It's important.

289
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
It's important.

290
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
It's important.

291
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
It's important.

292
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
The last time is 2, 2, 2.

293
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
94.

294
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
It's the same as the last time.

295
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
It's the same.

296
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Hamada-san is the last one.

297
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
This is advantageous for me.

298
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
At the first step.

299
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
This is difficult.

300
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
This is...

301
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
This is dangerous.

302
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
This is dangerous.

303
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
This is advantageous.

304
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
But,

305
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Onuma-san is fast.

306
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Onuma-san is fast.

307
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
He's catching up.

308
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
He's catching up.

309
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
He's not catching up, Yasuda-san.

310
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
He's not catching up.

311
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
But,

312
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Matsumoto-san won this.

313
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
This is interesting.

314
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I tried this.

315
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I see.

316
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I see.

317
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I see.

318
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Can I say one thing?

319
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
This is the most shameless location in Japan.

320
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
This is a simulation of the staff.

321
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I tried various patterns.

322
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
For example, 2 meters, 2 meters.

323
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I can't do this.

324
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I can't move my legs.

325
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
What should I do?

326
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
That's not good.

327
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
That's advantageous.

328
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
It's just a loss time.

329
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
The last one is not good.

330
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
The last one is not good.

331
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
But,

332
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
The last one is 2 meters, 2 meters.

333
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
It's still there.

334
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
But,

335
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
It's not interesting.

336
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
After all,

337
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
It's better to run to some extent.

338
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
It's okay if you decide.

339
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
If it's not good, I'll say it.

340
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Is that so?

341
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
It's up to you to decide.

342
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
You decide.

343
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
It's up to you to decide.

344
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
You guys are idiots.

345
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Idiots.

346
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
25, 25, 25.

347
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
This is the first one.

348
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
25, 25, 25.

349
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
This is normal.

350
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
What's the order?

351
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
The last one is Hamada.

352
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
The last one is Hamada.

353
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Let's go one on one with Hamada and Matsumoto.

354
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
The last one is...

355
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
It's not one on one.

356
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
You guys are idiots.

357
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
That's right.

358
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,500
The last one is 26 meters.

359
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
It's not good.

360
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
It's not good.

361
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
That's not good.

362
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I'm the only one who thinks it's funny.

363
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
No, no, no.

364
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
It's funny.

365
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
It's a service cut.

366
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I don't need a service cut.

367
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
It's an image.

368
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
It's your image.

369
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
It's 1 meter.

370
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
What kind of image is that?

371
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
It's an image of 26 meters.

372
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I see.

373
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
I think it's here and here.

374
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
It's different between me and Kosei.

375
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Yamazaki's baton is easy for Hamada to hold.

376
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
But Tanaka's baton is hard to hold.

377
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
I don't know.

378
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I don't want to do it.

379
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Hamada is not bad at all.

380
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
He's not bad at all.

381
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
And he's slow.

382
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
You have to remember it.

383
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
That's right.

384
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Don't be slow.

385
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Listen to me.

386
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Don't be bad.

387
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Don't be bad.

388
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
What are you doing?

389
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Mr. Hamada.

390
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm done.

391
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Stand up.

392
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
What is this?

393
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
He's sleeping.

394
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Stand up.

395
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
There's such a thing.

396
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
It's hard to decide the order here.

397
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
That's right.

398
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
The order is like this.

399
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
That's right.

400
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Let's leave the last one to Hamada.

401
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I'll leave it to Hamada.

402
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
An anchor.

403
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Really?

404
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Yes.

405
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
You're the top, right?

406
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I'll be the top.

407
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Really?

408
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Really?

409
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
That's fast.

410
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,500
At this distance, I think I can do it.

411
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
My power?

412
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
This is...

413
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
It's 25 meters.

414
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
What?

415
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I just decided.

416
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
It's 25 meters.

417
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Are you listening?

418
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
It's 25 meters.

419
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
So I can't do it.

420
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Then I'll be the third.

421
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You just decided 25 meters.

422
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
That's not good for Akko.

423
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
It's not good for Akko.

424
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Is this 25 meters?

425
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
This is the most...

426
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Decide that.

427
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
But...

428
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I think so.

429
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
For example, I'm 10 meters.

430
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
10?

431
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
10 meters.

432
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
The rest is 20, 20, 20, 40.

433
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Which one?

434
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Which one do you think?

435
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
That's right.

436
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Yamada-san should be shorter.

437
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Why didn't you ask for your opinion?

438
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Yamada-san is in the center now.

439
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Why are you in the center?

440
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
As a leader.

441
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Of the blue team.

442
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
As a leader.

443
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
I can't be stupid.

444
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Isn't it good?

445
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm sorry.

446
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
That's the real thing.

447
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
We're running.

448
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Four of us run 100 meters before the show.

449
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
We calculate how much we can run.

450
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,500
But you guys are not as young as you think.

451
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I don't think I can run that many times a day.

452
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
But if you do that once, it will be 3 hours later.

453
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
3 hours later.

454
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
3 hours later.

455
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
So we gather at the studio at 6 o'clock.

456
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
That's fast.

457
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Isn't that fast?

458
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
It's hard.

459
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
It's hard to gather at 6 o'clock.

460
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
We have to practice the baton after that.

461
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Then it will take an hour.

462
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
That's right.

463
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
An hour?

464
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
An hour?

465
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
The baton practice...

466
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,500
I can't accept the baton practice.

467
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Why?

468
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I can't accept it.

469
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I can't do that.

470
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Why not?

471
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
I mean...

472
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
It's good for us.

473
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
No.

474
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Your baton is my support.

475
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
That's why.

476
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
No.

477
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
It's your feeling.

478
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
We have to do it well.

479
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,500
We have to do it quickly.

480
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
You can say that.

481
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
You have to run 50 meters.

482
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
I have to run fast.

483
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
That's right.

484
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
You have to run fast.

485
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I can't do that.

486
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You have to give it to me.

487
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
You can't run fast.

488
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,500
If you think like that, when will I lose?

489
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
You can't be stupid.

490
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm not stupid.

491
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm not stupid.

492
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I know.

493
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm not stupid.

494
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm not stupid.

495
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
I don't look like that.

496
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I don't like the baton practice.

497
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Why?

498
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm the one who designed the baton practice.

499
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
What?

500
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,500
You need to look at the baton and deny it.

501
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I want you to look at my baton practice.

502
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
What kind of business do you have?

503
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I think this is the best one.

504
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I like the normal one.

505
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
It's heavy!

506
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Really?

507
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
It's heavy!

508
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
What is this?

509
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I can't see!

510
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Yamazaki!

511
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
What was that?

512
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
What was that?

513
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm sorry.

514
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Why did you say that?

515
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I can't see!

516
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
If I can't see, I can see again.

517
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
This is no good.

518
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
It's heavy.

519
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
I knew that this would be rejected.

520
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I knew that this would be rejected.

521
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
That's right.

522
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Please look at the next one.

523
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
How about this?

524
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I can't see!

525
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
How about this?

526
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
It's thick.

527
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You shouldn't hold the baton like this.

528
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Is this a pipe?

529
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Yamazaki!

530
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
It's a pipe!

531
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It's not a pipe!

532
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
It's not a pipe!

533
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
The pipe is like this.

534
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
The pipe is like this.

535
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
It's a pipe.

536
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
It's not a pipe.

537
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
The next one is this.

538
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
It's a pipe.

539
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I can't see!

540
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I can't see!

541
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
This is good.

542
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
This is good.

543
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
If you drop it...

544
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
If you drop it...

545
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
If you drop it...

546
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
If you drop it...

547
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I have to calm down.

548
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
I have to calm down.

549
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I have to calm down.

550
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
I can't do that.

551
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
This one is good.

552
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
This is good.

553
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Like this.

554
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Like this.

555
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I will run with this one.

556
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I will run with both of them.

557
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I will run with both of them.

558
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Just once?

559
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Just once?

560
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
In such a short amount of time, how can you do this?

561
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Can't I choose?

562
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
No, you can't

563
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
And then, the costumes

564
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Costumes?

565
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Wait a minute

566
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Is it okay to wear normal costumes?

567
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
No, I thought it would be better to think about costumes

568
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I've been thinking about it

569
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I think it's okay for all four of us to wear the same costumes

570
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Because we're a team

571
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I've been thinking about it

572
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Please change your costumes

573
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Okay

574
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
As a model

575
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Which one do you choose?

576
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Okay, I'll change

577
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Okay

578
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Hurry up

579
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Which one of those three should I choose?

580
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
That's right

581
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
What if I don't have one?

582
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
That's fine

583
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
But

584
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Don't you often see UO?

585
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,500
That's what I said, so I knew right away

586
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Okay, let's start with Tanaka's costume

587
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Here you go

588
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
What is it?

589
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I don't know

590
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
It's a design

591
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
No

592
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
You thought about it, didn't you?

593
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
No, listen

594
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
If you think about the time

595
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
If you think about the time

596
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
You can't avoid being sexy

597
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm not sexy at all

598
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
It's easy to run

599
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I know

600
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't care if I don't wear it

601
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Why don't you know about AHC?

602
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
It's shaking

603
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
The viewer's heart is shaking

604
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
What?

605
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
What?

606
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
What is this?

607
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Why are you so lonely?

608
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Because I'm cold?

609
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
It's an interesting way to take a picture

610
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Next, Yamazaki

611
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
I think this is fine

612
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Wait a minute

613
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Isn't this a trick?

614
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
I think this is fine

615
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
It's not a trick

616
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
It's a trick

617
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Of course, there are four people

618
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
It's a trick

619
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Each?

620
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
End

621
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
End

622
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
This is the best

623
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Excuse me

624
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
It's not cute

625
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
It's a running pose

626
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
It's a running pose

627
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Why is this?

628
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
But I'm a see-through

629
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
There is such a thing

630
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
No

631
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Genie is see-through

632
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
I've never heard

633
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm scared

634
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm scared

635
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
It's hard to run

636
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
From these three

637
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
No

638
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I will run normally

639
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
What kind of clothes do you wear when you run?

640
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
What kind of clothes do you wear when you run?

641
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I'm formal

642
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Formal?

643
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I don't agree

644
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Do you run like that?

645
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
If you get sucked in

646
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
It's ruined

647
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
What are you talking about?
