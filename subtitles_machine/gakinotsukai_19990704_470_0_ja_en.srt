1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The fifth time, Chikitsuki Gerojin Tsuri Senchiku!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the annual big event.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've already passed the fifth time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's introduce him right away.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He trains his body with a training machine every day and night.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Matsumoto!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll do it today.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Please.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll catch something I've never seen before.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Please say Basushu.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'll catch something I've never seen before.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll do it today too.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Please come in.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are rumors that you'll quit being a copywriter and become a professional.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Itoi Shinhano-san!

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not happy, but is it okay?

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, it's totally fine.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're in a good mood today.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, I'm totally fine.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Please take care of me.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The person who will make your life full of joy.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The king of the music world, Okuda Tamiya-san!

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you!

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you!

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you!

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How is your confidence today?

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have confidence!

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You have?

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have confidence today!

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Really?

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then, please do your best!

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank you!

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you!

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The future happiness of the newly married couple!

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Eguchi Yosuke!

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You are married and you are tired of the work.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think you're going to catch a good fish.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll ask you a little more.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How do you call your wife at home?

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Stop it.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Stop it. It's normal.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's normal.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Soon.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll win today.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll win today.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I won't wake you up anymore.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll call your name.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I told you to stop it.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Good luck.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you very much!

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Where did the cute guy from the debut go?

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Recently, he has been very popular, Mr. Yamada Keho Asaya!

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will continue to help you if there is a chance to laugh.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm crying now, but...

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's continue to help.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The man with a tall body who was shining in the drama, Samurai Ikki!

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hello!

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Nice to meet you!

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nice to meet you too.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you a fisherman?

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is my first time.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What?

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is your first time?

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Everyone has fishing experience,

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and they are all good at fishing.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you have any confidence in winning?

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, I do.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then, shut up!

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you!

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Please give me a big hand!

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Recently, the taste of young women has become popular.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Today, we will show you the charm of young women.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Kato Haruhiko!

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you fish?

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I used to catch a crab.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You came here a while ago and you didn't fish?

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I did practice.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
35cm deep.

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm fishing.

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If it's over 35cm, it's big.

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's about my size.

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't think so.

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please come.

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Finally, the defending champion of the entertainment world, Masato Hamada!

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Please, champion.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's the defending champion.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everyone is always looking forward to seeing him.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes, everyone is looking forward to seeing him.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm not good at it.

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're not good at it?

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you for your time.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please do your best.

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, let's start the meeting.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'd like to ask Tanaka-san to give a speech.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Today, B-class people are here.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
B-class comedian, B-class actor, B-class musician, C-class copywriter.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Copywriter?

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know what makes you happy, but I'll do my best.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll give you a lot of books.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll send you this.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the place where you can get money.

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You should know where you can't get money.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okuda!

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okudai, do your best in the gym!

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Think about it!

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eiji!

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Raw!

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Good one!

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Good one!

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Good one!

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okudai!

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, Okudai!

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hey!

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll do it properly.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll do it properly.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Cut!

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Put your ears out.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Put your ears out.

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is the last.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is the last.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ken Oro.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He's my father.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Be careful.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Everyone, do your best!

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
For some reason, I always get good results in the down time.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thanks to that, I'm able to hold a trophy in my heart.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm a very poor guy, so I think I'm the second crazy one.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I've had enough of playing around.

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to show you how much I can take a break.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm usually in the lower half of the room, so I'm thinking of eating the top place.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's aiming for the first place while asking.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll do my best not to lose to my rival, Kato.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If I win, I'll get a beer from Matsumoto.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll personally get a beer.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've lost 35 centimeters.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Everyone around me is saying I'm out of luck.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I'll aim for the number and size.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Please support me.

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The celebrities' fishing competition, everyone is starting at the same time.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nohaz is having trouble here.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey!

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's coming!

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okuda and Masaki are starting to get back to the start line.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The other members started fishing without worrying about the other members.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey!

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Isn't it terrible?

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What are you talking about?

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Who is it?

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you want to do that?

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry!

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you want to do that?

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Wait a minute, are you saying that I did it?

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right!

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's terrible!

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Meanwhile, the boat that had its first time in the competition with its usual partner, started to fish at a different point.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I want to be the first one.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And in the boat of Hamada, Enuchi and Sawamura, he keeps saying that he is the first one to get on.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm getting nervous at first.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not ready yet.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't be so hasty.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have to win no matter what.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This time, Eguchi secretly makes the investment.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
How many CDs do you want me to get?

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
About 30.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
30?

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you get 30, I'll get the CD.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Really?

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Alright!

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll get 30!

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll ask for a duet.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why?

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Duet.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sawamura and Tsugisoya, the guys who started with Kato.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ah, here it comes.

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
As Hamada predicted, Sawamura...

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They look so happy.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Alright, alright, alright.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Wait a minute.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wait a minute.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And Kato also hits.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're going to be exposed.

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is pretty good.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's true.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're going to be exposed.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's not coming.

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Kato is the first one to get hit.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's here.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Kawamura, who I just hit, hits again.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kawamura also hits.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Did you get it?

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That was a 50cm fish.

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
30 minutes have passed since the start.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okuda's first hit of the day.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's big.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's the first one.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
29cm.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And Hamada also got his first hit today.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you get caught?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Did you get caught?

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Damn it!

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm happy when I get caught.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
At the same time, Itoi fished another boat.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not a competition.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's like a waste of film.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Matsumoto is the only one who is not caught in the same boat.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm in trouble.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There is no sign of the boat.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The captain Okuda gets the second one.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's amazing.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is smaller than the one before.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Here, the little boy comes with a sash for each boat.

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How is the condition of the lake today?

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's dangerous.

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a good one, right?

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You know?

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's like a turtle.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is it cool?

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a turtle.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're so naive.

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's cool.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's so tight.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's small again.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okuda is fishing again

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What if I catch 30 fish?

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's fine

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Why?

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll produce it

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
7!

239
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Shut up, you bastard

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How was it?

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's not your fault

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You can't catch any

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You mean you can't catch any fish?

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You mean you can't catch any fish?

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It was a coincidence.

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Samurai-san.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Samurai-san, how was it?

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Your face changed. Did you have such a scary face?

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You should have had a more gentle face.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You were the second victim of the Seidama-no-Po, right?

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's right.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So?

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't be impatient.

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
At that time...

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Here it comes!

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's coming! It's coming!

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's coming!

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hamada-san is coming!

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not that big.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not that big, but it's Hamada's yearning bus.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's written that Shimano's commercial will continue.

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It just came out.

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It just came out.

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wow, oh!

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, Yippee!

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yippee!

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's the first time he's been hit in the face by Eguchi.

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh!

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is that a punishment?

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What do you think?

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That...

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's a punishment?

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No, no.

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Eguchi's somehow holding back his embarrassment.

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Small one.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, I guess I'll put on my lure, too.

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You didn't put on the lure?

279
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I did.

280
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why'd you do that?

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If I wear it, I can catch a lot of fish.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He doesn't care about the others, but he catches fish.

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's a boring thing.

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes! Yes!

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And Kato...

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey!

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Haruto!

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't get carried away!

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry.

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I can't help it.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The fish will come.

292
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're not going to tell me?

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you think it's bad

294
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That night, Kato appears again

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is good

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm getting caught

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Sorry

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Kato

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you close?

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Seriously?

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
How many are there?

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How many are there?

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's raining!

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I hate busses.

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
While the others are catching up, Matsumoto and Kisoukan are wandering.

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Meanwhile, the Okuda-Yamasaki pair...

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But my voice is good, right?

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Which is it?

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If I say it with a voice I like or I don't like, which is it?

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know the voice you're singing.

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This singing voice is haaaaaa

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Out

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You don't have to wear this, Eguchi-san

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're not alone

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're fishing

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's not related to the movie

317
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Downtown Lure Time

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The famous downtown lure time.

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The first person to catch a fish in 30 minutes will receive 100,000 yen.

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is a popular downtown lure in the past.

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This time, the pros will be recommended.

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is a good one.

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, really?

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This is Mr. Matsumoto's.

325
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is the shiny one.

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is Mr. Matsumoto's.

327
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Which one is better?

328
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The one with the Matsumoto lure is more popular.

329
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, really?

330
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It looks like a fish.

331
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Something's wrong with me.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Start!

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll take 100,000 yen.

334
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll take it seriously.

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The racing battle for 100,000 yen begins.

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Then, Eguchi's car will die.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is it here?

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's here.

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
100,000 yen!

340
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Ah!

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's here! It's here!

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Eguchi is frustrated.

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
However, all the members were satisfied with the improvement this time.

344
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's not like there's no chance of winning.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's different from before.

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm awake.

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
After 10 minutes, he's back to the starting line.

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Will Eguchi be able to get the 10,000 yen?

349
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Here it comes!

350
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Eguchi is once again crying out in pain.

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
At that time, Matsumoto is in trouble.

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Here it comes!

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He's coming!

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Matsumoto!

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Matsumoto is a great guy

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That was a great fight

357
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What? You're a good runner

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're a good runner

359
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then, in the second half...

360
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's coming from there.

361
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hey, what are you doing?

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're making fun of me!

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're making fun of me!

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're making fun of me!

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okuda, who's maintaining the lead, hits it right away.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He's catching up to it.

367
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And then, on the other side, Sawamura still has no catch.

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A bit of air is flowing.

369
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But then...

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's coming!

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's coming!

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I did it!

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I did it!

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm aiming for the victory

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yamasaki who couldn't catch another one also caught one here

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The blood is coming out

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Out!

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The one who caught it is the boat's screw

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There's not much time left, and it's the last spurt.

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Here, the defending champion Hamada's determination is on the rise.

381
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The score is getting bigger.

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who will win the championship?

383
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Good work, good work.

384
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We'll start with the Samurai one.

385
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Thank you.

386
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's one.

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's one.

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's two.

389
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Tsutari-kun!

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm Tsutan!

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are you saying?

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's not like I'm zero!

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
21

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
21

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
21

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
21

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The winner is...

398
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yamada-san!

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yamazaki, what's going on with you guys?

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Actually, Yamazaki is...

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Tsutan!

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm here!

403
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're the end!

404
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't go after the end, Kimitsu-tan.

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, you're so energetic.

406
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No, I'm not!

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm over 60!

408
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
3.5

409
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hey, Kato-san!

410
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This guy is pretty small.

411
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's right.

412
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He's pretty small.

413
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
3.5!

414
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's huge!

415
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's pretty big!

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No!

417
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I've measured everything.

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's number 1.

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's 30.

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's 30.

421
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why?

422
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's 30.

423
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's 50 yen.

424
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Ah, but it's 30.

425
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
30.5, huh?

426
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
30cm.

427
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's big.

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's big.

429
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is also 30cm.

430
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's beautiful.

431
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're doing the same thing.

432
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There are three.

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not enough.

434
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The last one.

435
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Two.

436
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Two.

437
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're surprised.

438
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's a big one.

439
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Four.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Four.

441
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Next is the last one.

442
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is...

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yo! The lid is closed!

444
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're forcing yourself to do it.

445
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's huge!

446
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's huge!

447
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you win this, what would it be?

448
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Ah!

449
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
27cm.

450
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
27cm!

451
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
27cm!

452
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
27cm!

453
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
27cm!

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Ah, Itoi-san!

455
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's a big one.

456
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How many did you catch, Itoi-san?

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think I caught four.

458
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh!

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's a square.

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, it's Oyama-san!

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
29?

462
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is not 30.

463
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
29!

464
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
29!

465
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, it's a top!

466
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Now, Kamiyama-san!

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes!

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, it's a tight!

469
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's the most!

470
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Wait, count all of them.

471
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't see it.

472
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't know.

473
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can't remember.

474
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is 29.

475
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
29.

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then, how about this?

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's over 30.

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's over 30. Wait a minute.

479
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But it's 30.

480
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's 30.

481
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's 30.

482
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's 30.

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The one before.

484
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can't remember.

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Look.

486
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a little...

487
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's coming out.

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is Kato's mocha.

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's out.

490
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's about 2.

491
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Then, 30.2.

492
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I didn't think he would put that much detail.

493
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's not that much.

494
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's a big difference between 1 and 2.

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then, I want to eat meat.

496
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Look, 30.5.

497
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Thank you.

498
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wait, you can say it after you see mine.

499
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's play 2-line game.

500
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, it's switched.

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're wrong.

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're so short.

503
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No, I'm short.

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
24 seconds.

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The winner is...

506
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Kato Akanesaka!

507
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Amazing!

508
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He's still in the lead.

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's still in the lead.

510
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm so happy.

511
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And the winner is...

512
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The best T-shirt!

513
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The best!

514
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is amazing!

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is the best T-shirt!

516
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The 5th fishing competition closed with the following results

517
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Here, we present the winner, Kato Haruhiko's 3mm T-shirt

518
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And the help of Megabus, who helped us with the downtown lure

519
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We present this lure to 10 people

520
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Please apply to the next round.

521
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I was thinking of winning the championship and then going fishing.

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But fishing is just that.

523
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is the result I got.

524
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
My last miracle was a great talent.

525
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm looking forward to it.

526
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I was going to win next year, but I didn't have the intention to win today.

527
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So I think it's just right.

528
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I failed again this time.

529
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Next time, I will win.

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I will do it like this.

531
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
When I announced the combination, I was a little annoyed.

532
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I was a bit shocked, but that's how I became like this.

533
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I want to be like that, so next year I want to practice the release.

534
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I want to change the rules.

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think animals can do anything.

536
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I caught a lot of monkeys and peaches, but I couldn't catch any fish.

537
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I would like to change the rules a little.

538
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This time, I'm the gaming champion, so I thought I had to make a decision.

539
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I didn't say it until the end, but I didn't put a lure.

540
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Next time I will try to do my best with a lure.

541
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Today I got to fish for the first time.

542
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I got 3 baits.

543
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I want to enjoy fishing while maintaining the beginners.

544
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Thank you very much for today.
