1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're underestimating me, aren't you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're underestimating me, aren't you?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is no good!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Up until now, the use of the kid was the Grand Prix for anger.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Grand Prix for stomachache.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The Grand Prix for surprised faces.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are various Grand Prixs that decide the king

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And tonight, a new Grand Prix that decides the king opens the curtain

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Chikubi Water King Grand Prix

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This time, we will have a battle to decide the king of the new genre, Chikubi Water King

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The judges are two people from Downtown.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I think we are the most of these members who are sucking their nipples.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Based on the experience.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I think it is better to judge the person who is sucking their nipples.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In the normal sense, Hamagawa-san is also...

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He is sucking more than me.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He is sucking more than you.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, no, well...

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He is a bit of a poison.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He is not a poison.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not scared at all!

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This time, we will challenge the moon-like star, Kokoriko Endo Tanaka

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And the first appearance of the child's world, Miki Kosei

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please explain the rules

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This time, we will do something that the challenger doesn't know

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We will ask you to go to the target mode and see if you can suck their nipples.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
However, there is a possibility that the video of a man sucking a man's nipples will be unbearable to watch on TV.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We have prepared a button in front of the two of you.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you two are judged that you can't show it, please press the button that you can't show.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you press it, the video will stop and it will be said that it is only sound.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you think it's good, press the button.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The video will be back.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's like a compliance.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I thought it was bad.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We can't do that.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, it's good.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
At first, I thought it was a woman.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But it's not good.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I agree.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The person who can show the most on TV is the champion of this water.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Of course, the way to suck is to follow after sucking.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There is no follow.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Of course.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That will be the subject of the judge, so I would like you to do your best.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's go. The first challenger is Endo.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, Mr. Endo's target is this person.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mr. Yoshimura.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is quite a high level.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, it is.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
After all, he has a unique sense of tension.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a bit embarrassing.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is really, at that time, he was called the demon army.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The juniors below us were already shaking.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He is a strict senior.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
However, once he started to suck, he could take it all.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Eh?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Really?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's that type of person?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's still this young?

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Even in front of his juniors...

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's still this young?

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Kakariko Endo, let's go!

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, thank you.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Good morning.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He suddenly came out.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's hard to do.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's good.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll give you a little bit of a break.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When I say it, it feels like I'm starting to get a little bit of a break.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm going to talk about it a little more.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm scared.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a solid story.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you do a push-up and do a squat, it's like you're doing a push-up.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't do it like I'm doing it.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I used to do this when I was tired.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I used to do this when I was tired.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have to hold it.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have to hold it.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like this.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You can do it like this.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How about this?

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is good.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Why?

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can do it like this.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you understand?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is the hard one.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you put your right ankle on it, it's not like you are leaning your right arm.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's like that.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's real.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've never heard of it.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,460
WhKapo,

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:34,820
Can Mario pick music boxes or send them to the

97
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
This is for the left side.

98
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Left side?

99
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Yes, for the left side.

100
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Let's go to the right side.

101
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Then, the K is...

102
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
I don't think it's okay.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I'll pretend to be a spring.

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
The left side is...

105
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
For the left side...

106
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Oh, I see. I have to go back once.

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
You have to go here.

108
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
What are you going to do here?

109
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm scared.

110
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
I pulled it a little.

111
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
You have to go straight.

112
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
You have to go straight.

113
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm scared.

114
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm scared.

115
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
It's not good.

116
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Please watch here.

117
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
What is this?

118
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
I was wondering if I could see it.

119
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
It's easy to breathe.

120
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
It's easy to breathe.

121
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
It's easy to breathe.

122
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
It's easy to breathe.

123
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
It's from the bottom.

124
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,820
It's not blowing.

125
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,820
What kind of Korean do you do?

126
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
What are you doing?

127
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
I'm doing a swap.

128
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Swap?

129
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
What are you doing?

130
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm sorry, but I'll show you.

131
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,820
I'm going to show you how to do it.

132
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,820
I'll show you how to do it.

133
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I brought him here.

134
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
Wow!

135
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
What?

136
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Look at this.

137
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Look at this.

138
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
It's definitely a costume.

139
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Amazing.

140
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
You're the one who's coming out.

141
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
What?

142
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
What?

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Amazing.

144
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
We've already crossed the pass.

145
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
We've already crossed the pass.

146
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
We've already crossed the pass.

147
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
His face is...

148
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
His face is...

149
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Amazing.

150
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
He makes a lot of noise.

151
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
He makes a lot of noise.

152
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Amazing.

153
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820
When Kimu crosses the pass, he is very noisy.

154
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
That's right.

155
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
This is exactly what Matsumoto-san said.

156
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Exactly.

157
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
He is a M.

158
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I see.

159
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,820
So, if the channel changes, I can accept all.

160
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
He is the last one who was chosen.

161
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
He couldn't accept it.

162
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Matsumoto-san said that there was no after-haul.

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
I was blowing.

164
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
That's right.

165
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
If I blew, there was no problem at all.

166
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
That's right.

167
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I also asked for the contact information.

168
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
It's real.

169
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
You know it, right?

170
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
I'm not kidding

171
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I know it

172
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
The next challenger is Tanaka-san

173
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Please

174
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Tanaka-san's target is this person

175
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
It's here

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
It's B. Orogon-san

177
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
This is quite a challenge

178
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,820
I have worked with him several times a year

179
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,820
I can't imagine how he would react to this.

180
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
He might be scared.

181
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
He might be a little scared.

182
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,820
So I'm trying to imagine that he might be a little scared.

183
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
How long has Tanaka been a chikubi-sui?

184
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Two years.

185
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
I don't think he's been a chikubi-sui for two years.

186
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
The last time we knew was in May this year.

187
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
I'm married this May.

188
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
I don't want to see it now.

189
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Of course, I want to see it.

190
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Tokoriko Tanaka, let's go!

191
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Yes.

192
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Hello.

193
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Hello.

194
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
It's a little different.

195
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
It's a special night.

196
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
I want to go like this.

197
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
It's hard to take off my clothes.

199
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
I was surprised. I saw the same picture.

200
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
You didn't see it, did you?

201
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
No.

202
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
The same picture.

203
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
The same picture.

204
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
I heard that.

205
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,820
We were looking for people in trouble.

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
We were looking for people in trouble.

207
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
I heard that.

208
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I was doing martial arts.

209
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Do you still do it?

210
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Yes, I like it.

211
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
I'm so tired.

212
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
My body is so strong.

213
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm so strong.

214
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,820
My arms are thicker than before.

215
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
I'm so strong.

216
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
I'm 4'6".

217
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm working out every day.

218
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
I want to do it.

219
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
I want to work out.

220
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
I want to do that.

221
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
I want to do that.

222
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
It's like a big fish eating a big fish.

223
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Oh, that one?

224
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Can you do it?

225
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
I can.

226
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Just a little bit.

227
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
I can do it.

228
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Oh, you can?

229
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Oh, that's great.

230
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
This is the body.

231
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Move your left hand.

232
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Move your left hand consciously.

233
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
You are not moving your hands now.

234
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
I'm not moving my hands.

235
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Bobby, you can do it!

236
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
You can do it!

237
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:42,100
If you become a

238
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
What are you doing?

239
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
There's a lot of boobies.

240
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Boobies.

241
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Boobies' boobies...

242
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,100
If you touch them, they'll move.

243
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
What are you talking about?

244
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,100
I touched them, but the boobies got stiff.

245
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,100
When they got stiff, the boobies were moving.

246
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
If the boobies were more stiff,

247
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
the boobies would move.

248
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,100
If you do that, you'll fall down.

249
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
You're talking big.

250
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
And then...

251
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
The volume is amazing.

252
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
And then...

253
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
You'll be like...

254
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
He's definitely not happy.

255
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Stop making a fuss.

256
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
You can live.

257
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
What are you talking about?

258
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
What are you talking about?

259
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Everyone...

260
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
He's just laughing.

261
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Wait a minute, what are you saying?

262
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
What are you saying?

263
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,100
There are people who are like that.

264
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,100
But I'm not alive anymore.

265
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
What are you talking about?

266
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I can't see it.

267
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Robin is scared.

268
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Oh, this is bad.

269
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
What is this?

270
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
This is bad.

271
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
It's dangerous.

272
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
It's not good.

273
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
What is this?

274
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
I was surprised.

275
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I was surprised.

276
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
What does this mean?

277
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
What is this?

278
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
For example,

279
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
I'm going to do it.

280
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
You two are so cute.

281
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
What are you two doing?

282
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
It's like a gel.

283
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I think the gel is sweet.

284
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
It's not sweet at all.

285
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I'm going to do it.

286
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
It's a tiger stone.

287
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,840
OK, OK...

288
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,380
What?

289
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,980
Oh, I'm choked!

290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
tired?

291
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,620
Like if we have to cry?

292
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,860
I water-throw bath so theleo will be better than soaked

293
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,880
What?

294
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
It was good to enter.

295
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I wanted to show my muscles.

296
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
I was glad to be asked to do it.

297
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
His nipples are quite sensitive.

298
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
That's what it is.

299
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
It was good.

300
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,880
So if you sit down, I don't think Bobby will be funny.

301
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
If you get tired once.

302
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I can't put it in with Bobby.

303
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
It's amazing.

304
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I can't keep my sanity.

305
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Let's turn to the next challenger.

306
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Next is Kosei of Mickey.

307
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Please.

308
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Please.

309
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Why him?

310
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Well, I think I look like a nipple.

311
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Do I?

312
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I don't think so.

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Which one is it?

314
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Please stop.

315
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Please look at it.

316
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I heard that it's better to have a nipple with a little bit of a rough feeling.

317
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
That's why I chose this.

318
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I think he will go to his senior.

319
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Let's see.

320
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
The target of this year is this person.

321
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Daigo.

322
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Daigo.

323
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I can't see him.

324
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:15,860
Daigo is also a bit of a

325
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,880
When I was auditioning in Osaka, I was very scared.

326
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I was walking and I couldn't see his face.

327
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,880
And the person above him, so the number of times he has to do the chikubi is a big hurdle.

328
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
I wonder if this will work today.

329
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Now, let's start the chikubi of Kosei.

330
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Kosei Niki, let's go!

331
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Yes.

332
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Come in.

333
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm home.

334
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Kou?

335
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Yes.

336
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
What's up?

337
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I haven't heard from him at all.

338
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
He's not home yet.

339
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
It's still Osaka.

340
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,880
How long have you been in Tokyo?

341
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
I've been in Tokyo for two days.

342
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Living in a hotel is really hard.

343
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
But it's not convenient.

344
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
What is this?

346
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I see.

348
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
You are the worst.

350
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
You are bad.

351
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I was scared.

352
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I like Tsukubisu.

354
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I love it.

355
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:59,880
I know it's strange to say this, but I want you to do it.

356
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,880
He said it clearly.

357
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,880
I'm a reliable brother.

358
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,880
What do you want from your brother in Tokyo who is only for your nipples?

359
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Then, please let me do it.

360
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
If I think, I can't do it, I can do it.

361
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Why do you come from above?

362
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,880
You are trying to deny me.

363
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,880
If I ask you to lick my buttocks, I can do it.

364
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Why don't you understand?

365
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm saying it's hard, but I'm really tired in Tokyo.

366
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
You know that I'm tired.

367
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I've never heard of it.

368
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,880
It's a wall of Tokyo I've never heard of.

369
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,880
It's a wall of Tokyo I've never heard of.

370
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Please take it off.

371
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
But we are talking.

372
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Please take this off.

373
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
No, it's not like that.

374
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
You are young.

375
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
That's why I'm saying that we should decide.

376
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
I'll take it off.

377
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
No, I'll take it off.

378
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Don't look at me like that.

379
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Why are you taking it off?

380
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
What did you do?

381
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,940
Yes, it was in the mountains near Shibuya, in the north of Tokyo.

382
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,040
More then that...

383
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,680
Each thing you entered,

384
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,340
You had entered,

385
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
Good, But,

386
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,020
It was in another way and you left it.

387
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,160
Yes, take it to another body,

388
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
and at that moment,

389
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,040
One nice woman Hol Yoshimoto

390
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,660
came up here,

391
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,160
and she asked,

392
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,260
Do I have a顔?

393
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,400
Then I explained the meaning.

394
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Glue.

395
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
But,

396
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm not sure.

397
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
I think you have to be more energetic.

398
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
I see.

399
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
More energetic.

400
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
What should I do?

401
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Take a sip.

402
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I can't do it.

403
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Forget it.

404
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Don't look at me like you're saying,

405
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I took a sip.

406
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
What do you mean?

407
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I'm doing it once.

408
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I don't understand.

409
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I don't get it even if I do it.

410
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Look at me.

411
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
You're being greedy.

412
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I said it twice.

413
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I'll forget it today.

414
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Excuse me.

415
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
One night.

416
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Excuse me.

417
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
What is this?

418
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
One night is long.

419
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Which one do you want to forget?

420
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I'll do it.

421
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
No, that's not it.

422
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,800
The opinion of the person who gave up is not important.

423
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I'll forget it.

424
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I'll do it once.

425
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Don't make fun of me.

426
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I'll do it once.

427
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I'll do it once.

428
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I'll do it once.

429
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
I'll do it once.

430
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Thank you.

431
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
You'll get something out of it.

432
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I was really scared.

433
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I was scared. I didn't know what I was going to get.

434
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I was really scared.

435
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,800
But you did a lot.

436
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I can't change it anymore.

437
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
How many seconds?

438
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I've already decided.

439
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
10 seconds.

440
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
That's a long time.

441
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
10 seconds is long and scary.

442
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
10 seconds of silence.

443
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm the one who's going to change it.

444
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Please tell me your opinion.

445
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
It's not normal for you to do that.

446
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
You're sitting in the back and you're screaming.

447
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Can you show us once?

448
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
The trick.

449
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Can I?

450
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I'll count.

451
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I can't see.

452
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I'll do it.

453
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Thank you.

454
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

455
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
It's like this.

456
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Look at this! I really want you to see this.

457
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
I worked really hard on this.

458
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
I really want you to see this.

459
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
You're really working hard.

460
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Yes, it's amazing.

461
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I really worked hard on this.

462
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I'm really scared.

463
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Look at this.

464
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,800
It's terrible.

465
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,800
You did it.

466
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
You are so hot.

467
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
I'm standing here for 20 minutes.

468
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
It's so comfortable.

469
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
How do I feel when I go home?

470
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:14,380
I feel like I'm in the

471
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Thank you very much.

472
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:30,680
Work hard...

473
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,720
I'm freshed out!

474
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,880
Daigo seemed a little off at the very beginning

475
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,840
I wonder if he went to lane him instead

476
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,920
Just hard problem

477
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,440
But you had so much nurf at the beginning

478
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,640
He even had me standing in my face

479
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
I was stepped on my face.

480
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
I was stepped on my face.

481
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
So it was good.

482
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
On the contrary.

483
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,640
But the distance was shortened a lot.

484
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
I thought it was shortened.

485
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,640
But Daigo-san became more gentle than I expected.

486
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
When I said hello, he said,

487
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
You are the one who sucked my nipples.

488
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,640
But he was completely conscious of it.

489
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
He was completely conscious of it.

490
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,640
I forgot it, but Daigo-san still remembers being sucked in the nipples.

491
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,640
It's a very attractive event.

492
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
That's right.

493
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Next week!

494
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,640
The final episode of the Chikubesuiyo Grand Prix!

495
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Who will challenge that veteran comedian?

496
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,640
This looks like fun!

497
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
It's like we're dating!

498
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Who will win the championship?

499
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,140
Do you want to do an inertia?

500
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,640
I want to do an inertia.

501
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,140
I think it's like a racer.

502
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,640
I'll do a hot pop-punk.

503
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
You must not laugh at the 24 hours of the Science Fiction!

504
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,640
DVD & Blu-ray will be released on November 29th!
