00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Kotonohottan was in the middle of recording last week's talk.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You know the one you open the bottom of the kitchen?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And you put a bowl or something on it?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have one like this.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can put four of them with the tape.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But this is...

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is definitely not good!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is life!

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I know that.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You open it, right?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You put it on, right?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You put it on the bottom, right?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're crazy!

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Matsumoto, who can't control his anger, began to draw more details after the show.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think I did four of them.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then...

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Like this.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What the hell is this angle?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then...

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Bang!

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What was I supposed to look for?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's look for this.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's look for this.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He decided to look for the problem.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But Hamada, his partner, doesn't care at all.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How do I look for it?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like this.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like this?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Like this?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like this?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Like this?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't need to look for it.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Does the Otamakake family, who has such a mediocre look, really exist in this world?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
With his sharp sense of observation and unrivaled insight, Mr. Matsumoto challenges the root of evil that lurks in modern society.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Matsumoto, Cutting off Society.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Otamakake's Review.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Suddenly, downtown went to look for Otamakake's problem.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mr. Matsumoto, isn't it around here?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There's a hook like this.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not like this.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's like this.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's down here.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Around here.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is...

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is Otamakake.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This...

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is terrible.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This hook.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The color is different, but the angle is close to mine.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's like this, isn't it?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's close, isn't it?

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not like this, is it?

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Look at this.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If it's like this...

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is good, too.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is good, too.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If it's like this, there's no problem at all.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's straight.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's try this.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This?

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes, let's try it.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's that?

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's gas.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's gas.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's gas.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's do an experiment with Otamakake.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The shape is a little different, but the angle is close.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's almost close.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What is this?

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's an unbeatable angle.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's try it.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you ready?

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're going to do a commercial here, aren't we?

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's do it.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't do it.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Two out of three have fallen.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But I can't help it.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You know, when you're cooking, you want to do it well.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
At that time, you can do it like this.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm in a hurry.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you doing with this?

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is a little different.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I can't help it.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's okay.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right?

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been saying this all the time.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why do I say this so strongly?

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is a matter of life and death.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're kidding me.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This has fallen in the kitchen.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This has nothing to do with people.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What are you looking at?

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I got it.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's buy something like this.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is the real deal.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is a disaster.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the real deal.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Where are we going?

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll show you the horror of Otamakake.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why does this Otamakake have to do with people?

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The car is going to a certain place with Hamada on it.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mr. Machan.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We've come to such a place.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Isn't it okay?

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll show you the shocking video from the back.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm not going to shock you.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just going to fall.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll show you again.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's all going to fall.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why is this so small?

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's zoom in on this shocking video.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is what happens when you zoom in.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's shake the camera.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Here you go.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is what happens.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you two idiots?

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm here with Jimmy today.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why are you here with Jimmy?

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want you to experience it with your body.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is what was faithfully reproduced until the end of Otamakake.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is a disaster.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is impossible.

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I want you to see what's going on.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll choose two people who don't have numbers.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm a talent.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you use a talent with numbers, it will go in a different direction.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is not a punishment game.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is an experiment.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's open it.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can't stop it.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you doing?

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You look happy.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's 40 and 33.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is that so?

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's 41.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's reproduce it.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll press this button.

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go.

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Switch on.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You fell.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You fell on your face.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hurry up.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is dangerous.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I saw the camera.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I saw the camera.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is a disaster.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is a disaster.

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have to raise the angle of Otamakake Hook.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Look at this.

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is what happened.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I wanted to say this after two weeks.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Say it in the talk.

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Everyone was listening to the joke.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The staff of Gaki no Tsukai are being carried.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You did it.

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
After this, there was an unexpected development for Matsumoto.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Matsumoto.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I found out one thing.

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What is it?

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Look at this.

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is a new truth.

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I wanted to surprise you.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is the hook I bought at the store.

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Look at this.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The hook of this angle is attached to the back of the door.

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The hook you are talking about is attached here.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The hook of this angle is attached to the back of the door.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The hook you are talking about is attached to the back of the door.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He said something good.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The hook you are talking about is attached to the back of the door.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He said something good.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He said something good.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What does this mean?

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is the wrong place to attach the hook.

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is the wrong place to attach the hook.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you have any questions, please come to the show.

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We will solve it.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you have any questions?

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is a parking lot at KO Plaza Hotel.

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I can't park my car there.

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I see.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Do you know where to park your car?

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I thought it was attached to the back of the car.

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When I parked my car, I went to the wall.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's go to KO Plaza Hotel.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There are many people today.

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There are many people.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm scared.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Today is not a very interesting day.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm stupid.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Today is not a good day.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Today is not a good day.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I heard that GAKIMIZU is selling well.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
As expected, my strategy is correct.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm scared.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm selling well.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't sell well.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it bad?

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not good.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I have a cold coat.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think you have one or two.

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I failed.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you have one?

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have one.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I have one.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't have one.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't have one.

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Does it have anything to do with us?

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are a bad person.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You are a bad person.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are a bad person.

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't say that.

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You are a bad person.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you like money so much?

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why?

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why?

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You like money so much.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't say that.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If there is a 500 yen coin in a high place, you will climb it.

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's hard to find it.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If there is a 500 yen coin in a high place, you will climb it.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't like high places.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If there is money, you will climb it.

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You will definitely climb it.

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I said it in the opening.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
KO Plaza.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Why did you go there?

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why did you go there?

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why did you go there?

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a conference.

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's nothing.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not a conference.

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's like a conference.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why did you go to a conference?

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I went to a conference when I was in junior high school.

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I didn't go there.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hamada went to a conference.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I didn't go there.

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't go there.

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I went to a conference after a long time.

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I didn't go there.

255
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I went to a conference after a long time.

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I didn't go there.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't laugh.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I went to a conference after a long time.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't go there.

260
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's my story.

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Can you see it?

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you go there, the parking lot is strange.

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Look, it's wide, right?

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's wide and

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
where the cars bump into each other

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
there's a proper car stop.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's right.

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Like this.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right.

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Everyone is there.

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The wall is open, so

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
on the wall,

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
like this,

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Wait, wait!

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Keio brother, look at this.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Jonathan, look at this.

277
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Jonathan, look at this.

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Bunta!

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He's the closest!

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So,

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I wonder if I can go like this.

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I wonder if I can stop.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I wonder if I can go like this.

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I wonder if I can stop.

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm bumping into the wall.

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's no car stop.

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So, this is...

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
My car's rear is

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
damaged.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can't help it.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's a driver's mistake.

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a driver's mistake.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's a driver's mistake?

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm being called a driver's mistake.

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But, that's a driver's mistake.

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What?

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is strange.

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But,

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
you have to check it.

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Normally,

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
it's narrow and dark.

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's narrow and dark.

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But, when you open the door,

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
you can't go back like this.

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You can't do this.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
When you open the door,

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
you can't go back like this.

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
When you open the door,

312
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
you can't go back like this.

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When you open the door,

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
you can't go back like this.

315
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So, you have to go like this.

316
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There's a wall, right?

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You have to go like this.

318
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You have to go like this.

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is

321
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
really strange.

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This is

323
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Kei-Pla's fault.

324
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Kei-Pla's fault.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm amazing, aren't I?

326
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That was interesting.

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you, Kei-Pla.

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Kei-Pla.

330
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Kei-Pla.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Kei-Pla.

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Kei-Pla.

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mr. Matsumoto,

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
from the top,

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you're 84, 58, and 85.

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a nice proportion.

337
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's the secret of your beauty?

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you know where my office is?

339
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm a yellow cab.

340
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
A huge army.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm...

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
A yellow cab?

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
A yellow cab?

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm a yellow cab.

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, really?

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm a yellow cab.

347
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I really am.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But you don't really look at swimsuits.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's because

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm 32.

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think I'm getting old.

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
In the past,

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I was amazing.

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, really?

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was already

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
very popular around here.

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I was already very popular

358
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
with everyone around here.

359
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's interesting.

360
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you know what I mean?

361
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't say that.

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No, no.

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm getting old.

364
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Did you use silicone?

365
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I didn't use it.

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm getting old.

367
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm getting old.

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm getting old.

369
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm getting old.

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was a boccon.

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was a boccon girl.

372
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That was my catchphrase.

373
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well,

374
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't do it anymore.

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You can't do it.

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's strange that you're still here.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There's nothing here.

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's not true.

379
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you want me to tell you?

380
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was a boccon.

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I was.

382
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Ever since then,

383
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
my tongue was

384
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
boccon.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It was like this.

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It was dented.

387
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was like this.

388
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So,

389
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
it was drooping and coming back.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's gross.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So,

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
my boccon

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
was like this

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
on a sculpture.

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I understand.

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I was a boccon girl

397
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
from the land of the stars.

398
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why did you say that?

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You should have said that

400
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
from the land of the stars.

401
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That's fine.

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't want to talk about that.

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So,

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
84, 58, 85.

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think

406
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
this is just my

407
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
proportion,

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
isn't it?

409
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is

410
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
my point.

411
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I bought it

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
when I was a boccon.

413
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
A boccon?

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I bought it.

415
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
A boccon?

416
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes.

417
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why did you buy it?

418
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So,

419
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
80, 58, 85.

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
My opponent

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is 83, 50...

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What number is that?

423
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Your opponent is...

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What are you doing?

425
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This is my final point.

426
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I understand.

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What did you do?

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So,

429
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I bought it.

430
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I made up my mind.

431
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

432
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So,

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
let me borrow your pen.

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Why?

435
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I made up my mind

436
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
so it's 85.

437
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You made up your mind

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
so what did you do?

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's why I bought it.

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You bought it.

441
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I bought it in a three set match.

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Three set match?

443
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I bought it.

444
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So,

445
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
what kind of game is this?

446
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What kind of game is this?

447
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What did you do

448
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
to make it 85?

449
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's not a problem now.

450
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I bought it.

451
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It doesn't matter

452
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
if I won this.

453
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I played a cross game.

454
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I didn't lose.

455
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So,

456
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you played an A.C.I.

457
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So,

458
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
what did you do?

459
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
In the end,

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it was around here.

461
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So,

462
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I somehow won.

463
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But,

464
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

465
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So,

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I was around here

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and the opponent was here.

469
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A cross game?

470
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So,

471
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I won because

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
the opponent was at the end

473
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and I won because

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
the opponent was at the end.

475
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What?

476
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why did you win?

477
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a strange story.

478
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you win,

479
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
it won't be 85.

480
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You don't know anything

481
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
about the game at all.

482
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you win,

483
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it's a minus point.

484
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's why

485
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm telling you

486
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to teach me.

487
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What is it?

488
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So,

489
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
are you running?

490
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Running?

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't run.

492
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If I run,

493
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll lose.

494
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If I run,

495
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll be eliminated.

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

497
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Eliminated?

498
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes, I'll be eliminated.

499
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Where do you do it?

500
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What do you mean?

501
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Where is the place?

502
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Pool, pool.

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Pool,

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
poolside.

505
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Look,

506
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll tell you a good place.

507
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Do you do it

508
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
at such a small place?

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
No.

510
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You shouldn't run.

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well,

512
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
it's a poolside.

513
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You'll be scolded.

514
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You'll be eliminated.

515
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You shouldn't run.

516
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You shouldn't be eliminated.

517
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You shouldn't be eliminated.

518
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So,

519
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Chaya,

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
you don't know anything.

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Are you okay?

522
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
In the end,

523
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm fine.

524
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let me win.

525
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
In the end,

526
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I won at 184, 58, 85.

527
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I know that.

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I won at Kokutai.

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why do you praise me for that?

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No,

531
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
it's not like that.

532
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
My memories from when I was 29.

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why do you try to make it sepia-colored?

534
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know.

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't mean that.

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So,

537
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I want to say congratulations on winning.

538
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So,

539
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
tell me how you won.

540
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I finally said congratulations.

541
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
No,

542
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
no, no.

543
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You should have said it.

544
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I didn't mean it.

545
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No, no, no.

546
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What did you say?

547
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I wanted to say that.

548
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You changed your mind.

549
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When you were in your early twenties,

550
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
you were the AD of a TV station in Osaka.

551
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

552
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It seems that there was a legendary

553
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
legendary ball game.

554
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's right.

555
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Please show us the magic trick

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
once again.

557
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What kind of game did you play?

558
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well,

559
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I played Adribland.

560
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You played it every day.

561
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I played Ikanimosuminyo.

562
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You played it every day.

563
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You played it every day.

564
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I played it every day.

565
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What?

566
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I was called the pawn of the day.

567
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
My AD taught me that.

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Your AD is no good.

569
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't know why.

570
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You know why.

571
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't have the motivation

572
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
to play the real game.

573
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You mean that?

574
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes, yes.

575
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Can you show me?

576
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A normal AD.

577
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's okay.

578
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
4, 3, 2, 9.

579
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know where to start.

580
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You can say 9.

581
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
9.

582
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
4, 3, 2.

583
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, no.

584
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's hard to understand.

585
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, no.

586
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's annoying.

587
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why?

588
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Why?

589
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why?

590
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's annoying.

591
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No, no.

592
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It makes me angry.

593
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
No, no.

594
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I was like this.

595
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can't move right away.

596
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Your hands are like this.

597
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Like this.

598
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I can move right away no matter what I do.

599
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can't move.

600
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Why?

601
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I can move right away.

602
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Your legs.

603
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Why?

604
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I can't move.

605
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can move.

606
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What?

607
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't move.

608
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's annoying.

609
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why can't you move?

610
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You can move from here.

611
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't move.

612
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm stretching my legs.

613
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I can't move.

614
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I can't move.

615
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's not good.

616
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Why?

617
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And then like this.

618
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
When did you do that?

619
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
When I was watching the show.

620
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When I was watching the show.

621
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A round of applause.

622
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
A sign of applause.

623
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's harder for the audience to understand.

624
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The audience will clap like this.

625
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's weird if you do this.

626
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You don't know what to do.

627
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No, no.

628
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If you do this.

629
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I can't do it.

630
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I can't do it.

631
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I can't do it.

632
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What should I do?

633
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Like this.

634
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm doing it on my own.

635
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's an imaginary ball.

636
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I forgot.

637
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm glad you forgot.

638
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Like this.

639
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Can I?

640
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I can't stretch my legs.

641
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You said it was a ball.

642
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Why can't you stretch your legs?

643
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's always like this.

644
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I hate it.

645
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I can't stretch my legs.

646
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Like this.

647
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Five seconds.

648
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Four.

649
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Three.

650
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hurry up.

651
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm coming.

652
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm coming.

653
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Hurry up.

654
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't do it.

655
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I can't do it.
