1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The child's servant, the usual music player

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Endo, your daughter is playing with Hamada?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right, she's like a family toy

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
She takes me out to eat

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Since when did you become Tameguchi?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've never been Tameguchi

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But you are Hamada

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, Tameguchi is my senior

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That doesn't matter

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Endo and Hamada are the same

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So it doesn't matter if I'm Tameguchi or not

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But...

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do you have a problem with your senior?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, that's not it

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If Endo doesn't listen to Tameguchi, I can't beat Hamada

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I think Hamada wants me to use Tameguchi

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
By using Endo and Tameguchi

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My partner Tanaka can use Tameguchi

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Tanaka can use Tameguchi too

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I see

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So Yamaaki can completely use Tameguchi

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I see

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So if Endo doesn't use Tameguchi, it's impossible

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't think my senior and junior will change forever

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's all about how you approach it

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You'll notice no matter how stupid you are

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's pretty stupid

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But it's like, huh? What's this weird feeling?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's like writing on paper and explaining how to get angry

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can feel it, right?

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's really hard

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's hard to remember the basics

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You didn't know that much?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I learned it from the smell of bananas

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I learned it from the smell of bananas

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're a manager

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I finally learned it

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's different from the smell of bananas

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think it was around the beginning of the rainy season

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's recent

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think you'll know unless someone opens the box

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But I don't know

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because I'm a senior

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm thinking about the results

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hamada came to the scene without knowing anything for a few minutes

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Will Endo be able to listen to this man?

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors of the 5th generation

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The 1st Gagi no Tsukai Arai

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Chiki Chiki Kokoriko Endo

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Natsuno Ichiyoshi Geki Yuma

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Otokonotte Ryori Kyosho

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's summer

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Endo will introduce you to a dish that goes well with it

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have stamina

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want everyone to eat it

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you for making such a place

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
After this, how will Endo tell Hamada?

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you have something to help

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think there are various things

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hamada, can you do it?

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Please break the egg and put it in the bowl

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do it

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's okay to do it alone

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a recipe

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's fun to do it together

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I will eat this

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hamada, can you do it?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Can you mix it?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mix it?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't do it alone

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There are various things

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Please do it

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The trick is to mix it without breaking the egg

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's okay like this

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's delicious

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I prepared this cold rice

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please put this egg in this cold rice

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you put it in at this stage?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a lot of work

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
First, put this in

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can't see

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't know this

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I've never seen this

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll put this in

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It feels a little bad

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's not true

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is this okay?

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It is said that thick food is not good for summer

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Eggs are also good

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Please loosen this with a tea spoon

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's mix this

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is also important

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is very important

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Do you cook at home?

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I cook chocolate

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you cook at home?

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't cook at home

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't cook at home

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't cook at home

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you cook at home?

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't cook at home

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't cook at home, do you?

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't cook at home

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is it okay?

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please add salt

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't like summer

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If it's not delicious, it's meaningless

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I know that

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If it's not delicious, it's meaningless

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not making it properly

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I know

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Look at this

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There is a lot of salt

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know because it's salt

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I put this rice in

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Be careful

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I put this in

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There is a lot of rice

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Is this medium heat?

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is medium heat

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is medium heat

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Is medium heat the best?

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is important

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look at this

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This looks good

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is good

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is perfect

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is amazing

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can you give me sausage and mixed vegetables?

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Mixed vegetables are there

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Please add this

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
sausage

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is good

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is good

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is not good

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How about adding some minced meat?

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hama-san, do you like wieners?

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hama-san, do you like wieners?

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The color is good.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I like it.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's good then.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hama-san, can you hold this for me?

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Can you hold this for me?

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't think you should do that.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't you remember?

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, I remember.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Curry?

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not curry, it's dry curry.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Dry curry.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a bit too much.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
A bit more, a bit more.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay?

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, okay, okay.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll do it.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And then, like this...

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The way Hama-san mixed it wasn't very good.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The rice is a bit scattered.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It should be a bit more like this.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The point is to do it like this.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're going too far.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's really spread out.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's really close.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's really close.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's complete.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And then, put it on a big plate.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Isn't this amazing?

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is amazing.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Isn't this amazing?

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Isn't this amazing?

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Isn't this amazing?

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's spicy.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Look at this.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You put too much curry powder.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then, there's white pepper.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There's a lot of white pepper.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There's a lot of white pepper.

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then...

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is this?

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What is this? A tomato?

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, no, no.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
A tomato is a bit...

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's a small tomato.

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A small tomato.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You don't have to do it all over.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can just eat it.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But this is...

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Cooking and appearance are important.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's okay.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You don't have to put it in.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll put it in.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then...

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is a skinless small tomato.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I told you I'd put it in.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's been a while.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The color of the tomato is important.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Cooking is all about color.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll put it like this.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's done.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's done.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't need tomatoes.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I told you earlier.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't need tomatoes.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is a dish with tomatoes.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is a dish with tomatoes.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think you should try it.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't think so.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't eat tomatoes.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't eat tomatoes.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's eat.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's eat.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's eat.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's eat.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm pretty confident.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's eat.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I told you I wouldn't eat tomatoes.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I told you I wouldn't eat tomatoes.

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I told you I wouldn't eat tomatoes.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is...

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Children may like it.

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's right.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Ho-san and Tanaka like it.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I like it.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hame-chan likes it, too.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Children like it, too.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What is this?

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is a little small for me.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is a little small for me.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is still small.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is delicious because it is mixed with eggs.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is delicious because it is mixed with eggs.

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is delicious because it is mixed with eggs.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How is it?

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is spicy because I can't eat tomatoes.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't eat tomatoes.

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is impossible.

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is impossible.

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Tanaka.

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can eat this if I work hard.

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can eat this if I work hard.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Can I eat tomatoes?

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's eat this.

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What?

254
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What is this?

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Can I eat this with tomatoes?

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't eat tomatoes.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can I eat tomatoes with my favorite sausage?

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This is impossible.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Just one bite.

260
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is all.

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's work hard.

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Who are you talking to?

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is all.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Tanaka can eat this.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can eat this.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can eat this.

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can eat this.

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the second sausage.

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is difficult.

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I can eat this with tomatoes.

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You can eat this.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I eat this.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can eat this with tomatoes.

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can eat this with tomatoes.

275
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is impossible.

276
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is impossible.

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is impossible.

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This was delicious.

279
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
See you next time.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you for the meal.

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is delicious.

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This was delicious.

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is delicious.

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think you don't need to eat a lot of curry.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can eat this.

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is delicious.

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Endo, come here.

289
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Where are you going?

290
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm going.

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What is it?

292
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Endo.

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I know.

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm going.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
what?

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Anyway.

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I couldn't eat this.

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I couldn't eat this.

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was scared.

300
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I couldn't eat this as soon as I thought.

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I couldn't eat this even if it was 5 pieces of curry.

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can't eat this.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can't eat this.

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I can't eat this.

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I was angry when I heard Endo talking to Hamada.

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I can't eat this.

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I feel nostalgic.

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I want to take a picture of this.

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I want to take a picture of this.

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I feel nostalgic.

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I have 5 pieces of curry.

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have 5 pieces of curry.

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I was very angry.

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It was about 2 or 3 o'clock in the middle of the night.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
In the park near my house.

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was doing this.

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You were doing it.

318
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was doing it.

319
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It was about 2 or 3 o'clock in the middle of the night.

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It doesn't matter at this time.

321
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's strange.

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's about 2 or 3 o'clock in the middle of the night.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It doesn't matter.

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you crying?

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I was a little patient.

326
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I wanted to focus on TV.

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I was a little patient.

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was angry.

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I called the police.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I see.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There is a park near my house.

333
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is a park that everyone knows.

334
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There is a person who is holding a party at this time.

335
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I want you to do something.

336
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What is the name of the park?

337
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What is the name of this park?

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There is a park on the street, which everyone knows.

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What is the name of this park?

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What is the name of this park?

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm not sure.

342
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What is the name of this park?

343
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is a park.

344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Please be calm.

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is a park.

346
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,680
What's the address?

347
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,880
No, no, no.

348
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
I don't think so.

349
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
No, no.

350
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
I don't know!

351
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
I live in the park!

352
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
I don't know!

353
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,880
But Otaku live in the park, so it's noisy.

354
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
So tell me your address.

355
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
No, no.

356
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Huh?

357
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I can't tell you my address here.

358
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I want you to burn the fireworks in the park.

359
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Shut up!

360
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,880
I know that.

361
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Tell me your address.

362
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
No, no.

363
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
My address is fine.

364
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Shut up!

365
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I want you to burn the fireworks in the park.

366
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
No, no.

367
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
My address is fine.

368
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
You don't have to worry.

369
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I'll tell you my address.

370
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I love you.

371
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Why don't you tell me your address?

372
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Well, that's...

373
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
That's strange.

374
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,880
What if there's a huge incident in the park?

375
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
What should I do?

376
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
What's the address?

377
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
No one knows!

378
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Shut up!

379
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Go!

380
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Go right now!

381
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
And while you're saying that,

382
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
I'll tell you my address.

383
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
So tell me your address.

384
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
I'll say,

385
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Shizuka!

386
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm done with the fireworks.

387
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm done with the big fireworks.

388
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm done with the fireworks.

389
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I don't know what happened to you.

390
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I'll burn the fireworks in the park.

391
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
At least I wanted to see that.

392
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
That's right.

393
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,880
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Matsumoto,

394
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
who has been given 108 different nicknames.

395
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Mr. Matsumoto has been given the title of

396
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,880
the famous shocker by the Shocker Corps.

397
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Please tell us why you weren't given the title.

398
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Well,

399
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,880
I was fighting in the front.

400
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
What do you mean by the front?

401
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
I was fighting near the Kamen Rider.

402
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
I was fighting near the Kamen Rider.

403
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
You weren't in the back.

404
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
I wasn't in the back.

405
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
I see.

406
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,880
When the Kamen Rider decided the position of the fight,

407
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
he always put his hands like this.

408
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Oh, then here.

409
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
And he always,

410
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, yes.

411
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
I thought it was pretty close.

412
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
It was close!

413
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,880
I thought it was like this.

414
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
The Rider.

415
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
The Rider.

416
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
I thought it was like this.

417
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
I like that.

418
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,380
So you can give me the title of honor soccer player?

419
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Yes, you can.

420
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Why couldn't you give it to me?

421
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Well, there was a little failure.

422
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,880
You should have told me that, I wouldn't have said that.

423
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,880
First of all, when I came to the award ceremony, I wore a little tight-fitting sleeve.

424
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,380
I was worried that my skin was visible.

425
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,880
There were only two of them, and one of them was a little washed.

426
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,380
It smelled strange because it was dry, so I dried it in the room.

427
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,880
When I tried on the one I hadn't used much, it was surprisingly small.

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
And it was like this.

429
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,380
But when I got the award, it was really hard.

430
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
It's a shocker.

431
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,880
You should have shown your skin.

432
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,880
You should have shown your skin.

433
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
When I got the award, I said,

434
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
What do you think?

435
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,380
You should have said that.

436
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
I thought it was a little weird, so I said,

437
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:45,380
What do you think?

438
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,380
I heard that one of the rooms in Matsumoto's house is made of iron.

439
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Please tell me the advantages and disadvantages of it.

440
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Well, there are good and bad things.

441
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,380
What kind of window is the otaku's house made of?

442
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
There are three rooms.

443
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
3L, right?

444
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Yes.

445
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,380
And that room is...

446
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
That's right.

447
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,380
It's Tetsuko's room.

448
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,380
I wanted to use it, so I said okay.

449
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Why did you say okay?

450
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,380
I said I'd pay 20% of the rent.

451
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,380
It's not a bad thing.

452
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
But that's Tetsuko's room.

453
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
That's right.

454
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Don't you hate it?

455
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
But I said I could use it.

456
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
I said I could use it when I couldn't break it.

457
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,380
Oh, in that room.

458
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
What are the advantages and disadvantages?

459
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
There are many advantages.

460
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,380
What?

461
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Well, when I get home, I come here and do some light washing.

462
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
It's better to do it when you're young.

463
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Well, but they do it carefully.

464
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Tetsuko?

465
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,380
I think that's good.

466
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,380
I can cook some okara.

467
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
That's good.

468
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
What are the disadvantages?

469
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
There are many disadvantages.

470
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
There are too many.

471
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
The woman is a disadvantage.

472
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,380
When I put my head on the kotatsu.

473
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
I thought it was a woman.

474
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
It's not.

475
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,380
It's a head.

476
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,380
I'm surprised.

477
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
It doesn't bother you to live.

478
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,380
Do you mean that Zura?

479
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,380
No.

480
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,380
It doesn't bother you because you have a room.

481
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,380
I want to take a rest today.

482
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,380
But it's like this.

483
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Don't do it when you're awake.

484
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Don't do it when you're not awake.

485
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,380
It's already started.

486
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Agnes is coming today.

487
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Agnes?

488
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
I don't like it.

489
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,380
Sometimes I take a shower when I go home.

490
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
That's normal.

491
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
She doesn't come to the living room, does she?

492
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
She does.

493
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Why doesn't she come to your room?

494
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Because I only have a bus on my waist.

495
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
You're slow.

496
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,380
It's dirty.

497
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,380
You.

498
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:02,380
I had a fight with a remote control at the parking lot.

499
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
There was only one.

500
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,380
I said I wanted it.

501
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
It's 20%.

502
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,380
But I use it more.

503
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
I know that.

504
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,380
I use it more?

505
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
You don't need it.

506
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
This month is Tetsuko.

507
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,380
This month is me.

508
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,380
This month is Tetsuko.

509
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,380
I called her.

510
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Tetsuko got off the car.

511
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,380
She gave me a ride.

512
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,380
She's your girlfriend.

513
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
Is that so?

514
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Let's hang out together.

515
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,380
I'll give you a bus ride at that time.

516
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
I'll give you a ride at that time.

517
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,380
I'll give you a ride at that time.

518
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,380
At first, she stood up for me.

519
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,380
I got used to it.

520
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,380
Sometimes she came out of the door and hugged me.

521
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
She said, I don't love you.

522
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:31,380
I don't love you.
