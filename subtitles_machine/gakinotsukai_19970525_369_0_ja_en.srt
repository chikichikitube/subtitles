1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Reihou, Fujino Fumoto. This is the holy land of bus fishing, Kawaguchiko.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Two people from downtown started to learn fishing two years ago.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They were captivated by the charm of bus fishing, and Matsumoto was able to win the golden trophy that the fishermen longed for for two consecutive years.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And this year, the fishermen of the entertainment world gathered to aim at the emperor.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The third Gaki no Tsugai Alliance, Chikijiki Entertainment Fishing Championship!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Wow!

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
First of all, the participants!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good morning!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, it has started.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first participant is Mr. Matsutoshi Hamada.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is the third time.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, this is the third time.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My partner has already won the first and second times.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will do my best to win this time.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Please do your best.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I will take all of them.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then, I would like to invite various people.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Gaki no Tsugai Fishing Championship!

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The first challenger is Mr. Itoi Shigesato, who likes dad jokes.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Itoi.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How are you doing recently?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm doing well.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you doing well?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then, please do your best.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is it the end?

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's continue.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The second challenger is Mr. Tamio Okuda, who lives in the bus in Inseide, the capital of Paris.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Please come here.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you like to take the bus?

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, I like it.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is that so?

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then, please do your best.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The third challenger is Mr. Yosuke Eguchi, who is busy with drama.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How are you doing?

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hi.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I like it.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to take the bus today.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What time will you arrive at the bus stop?

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This time?

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What time will you arrive at the bus stop?

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What time will you arrive at the bus stop?

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
When the sun goes down.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When the sun goes down.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I understand.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please welcome the very first challenger.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He is from downtown Tokyo, in Anagasaki.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mr. Hideaki Tomuraga.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you very much.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Excuse me.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mr. Chokunaga, how do you feel about bus fishing?

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm looking forward to it.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I understand. Thank you very much.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the last one.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Defending champion.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Born for bus fishing.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Matsumoto Hitoshi.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't laugh at me.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't want to be introduced.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm angry.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyone, this is the trophy given to the champion.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've won it twice.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the third time.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I was born again.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's heavy.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
By the way, it costs 600,000 yen.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Really?

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The champion can take it home.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've won it three times.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you take it home, put it on the TV.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is it decided?

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's decided.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You'll know when the guests come.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
From now on, I'll give you a dantang lure.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Are you ready?

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll give each boat one set.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This time, as a special rule,

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you fish a bus with one of the lures in 30 minutes,

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
10,000 yen will be added for each one.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you catch it in the meantime,

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
10,000 yen for each one.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Which one do you want?

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Which one do you want?

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll put one set on each boat.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Which one do you want?

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Which one do you want?

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's get started.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You guys fish.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not going to be a show.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You guys, too.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Shut up.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come on.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come on.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't win.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm moved.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll do it.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll do my best.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Last time, it was Willy.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This time, it's this year.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This time, I want to go one step at a time.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well...

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well...

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll win.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I said it again.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, I'll do my best not to lose to Masumoto Hamada.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Who will get the golden trophy?

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The hot battle for the position of the man begins now.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
First, the Itoi-Matsumoto duo starts fishing at a point away from the other boats.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
As soon as he threw the fishing line, it hit the Itoi's rod.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OK, OK, OK.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is a net.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All of a sudden.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All right.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I got it.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is big, isn't it?

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is big.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
On the other hand, the Hamada-Tokunaga duo and the Okuda-Eguchi duo started fishing at the same point.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I got it.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wait a minute.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I got it.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I got it.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I got it.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's small, isn't it?

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I got it.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, don't get carried away.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's small.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's small.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Even though the prey is small, Hamada is a little impatient because he was caught first.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I haven't caught a big one yet.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Itoi-san.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Itoi-san?

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What kind of fish?

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A big one.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Really?

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What kind of fish is it?

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What kind of fish is it?

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I got it.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's easier to catch than before.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's big.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wow, it's big.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Itoi got another hit in a row.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's big.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's big.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm counting on you, The Ending Champion.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm counting on you, The Ending Champion.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't feel like I'm going to catch it.

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm going to be frustrated if I catch it first.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's the other way around.

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It was a good start, but after that, it was a combination of Okuda and Eguchi, which Sao didn't say was lucky.

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This time, I want to avoid only the small ones.

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I want to avoid only the small ones.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But if I catch all of them, I'll definitely lose.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm hungry.

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm hungry.

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's like a movie theater from a long time ago.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's amazing.

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm hungry.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's good.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm not good at fishing.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey!

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hey!

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm not good at fishing.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not good at fishing.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hey!

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The Hamada-Tokunaga combination is still not a hit.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's just that time passes quietly.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Brother, can you catch a big one?

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, I can't.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can't?

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't think you can do that.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I thought so, but suddenly there was a sign of a hit on Tokunaga's rod.

191
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's big, it's big.

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Eh, it's coming?

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Toki, you should have hit it earlier.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sorry.

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Asaki.

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's big, it's big.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You should go slowly.

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Drop it, drop it.

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You!

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
After this...

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Cut it, cut it!

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Alright!

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Alright!

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Alright!

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Cut it, cut it! Cut it in the middle!

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Alright!

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Cut it in half, cut it in half.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's hard.

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
7...

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
3, 4...

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, no, if you do it now, you'll be in the first place.

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think the one earlier, Tamiyo and Eguchi...

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Now, it's safe.

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't talk so much.

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's hard.

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you let Hama-chan catch it first, you'll lose with your mouth.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
On the other hand, Eguchi and Okuda's duo quietly went fishing.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You must be hungry, right?

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, excuse me.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I brought you a lot.

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I want to give it to you, but to be honest...

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have a younger brother under the same roof.

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What do you think?

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
For the last episode?

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
For the last episode.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is that okay?

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Seriously.

229
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll tell you.

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, please.

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then, I'll give it to you.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What about mine?

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It can be a short song.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't need it.

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Tokunaga-san said he caught one.

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wow.

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Only two of them caught it.

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I know how scary they are, so I won't say anything.

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I see.

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's amazing, too.

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll give it to you because I'm hungry.

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Really?

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll give it to you.

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll give it to you.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Tokunaga-san said he caught one.

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a broken radio.

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll give it to you.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
At that moment, Eguchi's rod was broken.

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is this big?

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Net, net.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is a good one.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's big.

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Cut it.

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's big.

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Cut it.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's big.

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let it go.

260
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Seriously.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's good.

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Eguchi, good job.

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Itoi and Matsumoto move to the spot where everyone is.

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I caught it.

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I caught it.

268
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You caught it?

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Everyone, we'll start the Dantann Rower.

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Please change to Dantann Rower.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have 30 minutes.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's long.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't say it's long.

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't have time to do this.

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm the one who caught it.

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Matsumoto Hamadaru is famous for the lake.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He moves to the surface in a beautiful way.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sure Black Bass can't help eating it.

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's throw it down.

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It doesn't have to be powdery.

282
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's heavy.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's heavy.

284
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I caught it.

285
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Where should I throw it?

286
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can't catch it.

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't catch it.

288
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Seriously.

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't catch it.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I have a motorbike.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I can't catch it.

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Look, it's floating.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Look.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't catch it.

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's floating.

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It won't sink.

297
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
30 minutes is hard.

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's hard.

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What do you think? 15 minutes?

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's make it half.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It won't sink.

302
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's make it half.

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If I catch one in 15 minutes, let's make it 20,000 yen.

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How can I catch it if it doesn't sink?

305
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's cool if you can catch it.

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's cool.

307
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is pretty hard.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is...

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's cut.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Which one did you cut?

311
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hama chan lure.

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I caught it.

313
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Did you catch it?

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Did you catch it?

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The lures are...

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's amazing.

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's floating.

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's cool.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's floating.

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's cool.

321
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We're friends.

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's cool.

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Did you go down there?

324
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's over.

325
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm glad.

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hurry up.

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's enough to replace it.

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't like it so much.

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Everyone, there's only one hour left.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you ready?

331
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The result of the down-to-end lure is zero.

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There's only one hour left.

333
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's only one hour left.

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
At that time, it finally hit Matsumoto's rod.

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Isn't it ten?

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right.

337
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
All right.

338
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's yellow.

339
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the Hamada-Tokunaga duo.

340
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It hit Tokunaga again.

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's coming.

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's small.

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He said it was small.

344
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's yellow.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's blue.

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's right.

347
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you catch it like that...

348
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't laugh, Hamada.

349
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I caught it, Matsumoto.

350
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Really?

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I caught one.

352
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Really?

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Only Hamada.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's no A.

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It won't end.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Are you serious?

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm serious.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
On the other hand, the Okuda-Konbi duo is silent.

359
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll do my best.

360
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Stop it.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
When the Yamazaki boat approaches to put the cut in the Itoi-Matsumoto Konbi...

362
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's coming.

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's big.

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's coming.

365
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's coming.

366
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's big.

367
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's coming.

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's coming.

369
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's coming.

370
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's in the water.

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
All right.

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's great.

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's big, isn't it?

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's big.

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
As expected of champion Matsumoto.

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He suddenly became the winning candidate.

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
On the other hand, Hamada still hasn't caught anything.

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Is Matsumoto's big?

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's pretty big.

380
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Really?

381
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I caught another one.

382
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The second one?

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I won't let you win.

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Hamada decided to compete at the same point as Matsumoto to aim for the big one.

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're in the way.

386
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're a bad guy.

387
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You're in the way.

388
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was aiming for the big one.

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're in the way.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Is it out of place?

391
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why are you running so hard?

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Take this.

393
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What is this?

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What should I do if I'm a bad guy?

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hamada was desperate to go fishing even though he had such anxiety in his head.

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's about time for the sun to set and there's not much time left.

397
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Eguchi and Okuda changed their points and Okuda caught something.

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is the biggest one.

399
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's the biggest one so far.

400
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I got something.

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's a lot.

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And Eguchi also caught something.

403
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's the biggest one today.

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I want to catch something.

405
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I want to catch something.

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He's so motivated.

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Meanwhile, Matsumoto caught something again.

408
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I wonder what it is.

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a good one.

410
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's a good one.

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Isn't it?

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's a good one.

413
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I wonder if it's a good match with the one before.

414
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hamada hasn't caught anything yet but he's changing his points again.

415
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh no.

416
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a big one.

417
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There's not much time left.

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
All the boats are gathering at one point.

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It seems to be going well.

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is bad.

421
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What do you think?

422
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He's catching a lot.

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Everyone.

424
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is the last 5 minutes.

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There's only 5 minutes left.

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Everyone is trying to catch something.

427
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Will Matsumoto catch three in a row?

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Or will Hamada catch something?

429
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We still don't know who will win.

430
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Who will be the winner of the 3rd round?

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The result is out.

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Everyone worked hard for the 3rd round.

433
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Everyone caught something.

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's start with Eguchi.

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How many did he catch?

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He caught a lot.

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a big one.

438
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's 32.

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
32.

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Tami.

441
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Bring the biggest one.

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a small one.

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's a big one.

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's a good one.

445
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's 32.

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's Togura's turn.

447
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's a big one.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's a big one.

449
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's 35.

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's 36.

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He was satisfied.

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a big one.

453
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's a big one.

454
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's 37.

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Matsumoto.

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why me?

457
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why me?

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's your turn.

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's okay.

460
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why?

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's my turn.

462
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's a big one, so I have to catch it at the end.

463
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I see.

464
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't want to be disappointed.

465
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I see.

466
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a good one.

467
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a dead one.

468
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I can't catch it.

469
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't catch it.

470
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I can't catch it.

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I can't catch it.

472
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's 36.

473
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's 36.

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's going on?

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What's going on?

476
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not over yet.

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What's going on?

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know.

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a big one.

480
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's amazing.

481
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Is it a joke?

482
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What's this?

483
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why is it a macadamia?

484
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's the worst.

485
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What are you doing?

486
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Some of you have caught it before.

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Before?

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Really?

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Before was before.

490
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So it's 37cm.

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Ito is the winner.

492
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm happy.

493
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Matsumoto is the winner.

494
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He caught three in a row.

495
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm disappointed.

496
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Please win.

497
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm happy.

498
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm so happy.

499
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And the number one T-shirt.

500
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm so happy.

501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The second place is Hikobito.

502
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Really?

504
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't have a lot of T-shirts, so I'll go with Matsumoto's T-shirt.

505
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Are you trying to improve your image?

506
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Wait a minute.

507
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I have a lot of T-shirts like this.

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm kind.

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's 36cm.

510
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a little tight.

511
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
As you can see today's results.

512
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Thank you for your hard work.

514
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Everyone, Ito's T-shirt is number one.

515
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is a gift for the viewers.

516
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Everyone wants it.

517
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't think there's anyone.

518
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If you want it, I'll give it to you myself.

519
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This is too much.

520
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This is my dad's joke.

521
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
As the first comment today,

522
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm going up one step at a time.

523
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I was able to get up from the last place to the fifth place.

524
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm happy.

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Today.

526
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The fish I let go was big.

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It was the first time I had one like that.

528
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Or I took it off.

529
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm going to time again every time.

530
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It was my first variety show.

531
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I had fun.

532
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'd like you to use it again.

533
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If there's another chance, thank you.

534
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Today.

535
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I've been down about five times since morning.

536
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I've been thinking about where and how to fish.

537
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I've been doing it until noon.

538
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm really happy to win.

539
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
After all, if you work hard, you'll get rewarded.

540
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll do my best, too.
