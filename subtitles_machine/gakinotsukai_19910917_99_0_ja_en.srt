1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear An-chan, happy birthday to you.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Happy birthday.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's so big.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's like Katsura in Okinawa.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's nothing.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You made a modified human.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Everyone, look.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I made a modified human.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is it, a modified human.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let it sleep.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let the human sleep.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I put something on it.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yamazaki Hosei was reborn as a modified human.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, he's awake.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What's going on?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's making a sound.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello, excuse me.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's not related at all.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you very much for your birthday.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you very much for your birthday.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hello.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now, the fools are here.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, the main character appears.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's welcome him.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Power Man No. 2.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a mess.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Bring it on.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The person who is dressed as Power Man No. 2.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The children of P.A.R.S. have become fools.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Even though they are dressed like this.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hello.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you don't say hello to them, they won't buy it.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hello.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hello.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is what an amateur should do.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want your panel.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So many people came.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They came.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a good thing.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There is a rule.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You have to dress like Power Man.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right. It's a good thing.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They came.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Fujiko, Fujio, and A are very happy.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
First of all, the panel.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the panel that everyone is talking about.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Everyone, you've seen it on TV.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The real thing.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is really like Mona Lisa.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's very valuable.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
From here?

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How do you take it?

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey!

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't understand.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't understand.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hey!

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
From below.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
From below.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Strangely enough, there was a reaction when the number of people showed up.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's a strange story.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This panel.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'd like to give it to one person by lottery.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then come here.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How many people came?

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Two people.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Two people came.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Which part of Power Man do you like?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The cute part.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The cute part.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're the same.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's cute.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay to talk like that.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Please draw one.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's open it.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's a boy.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's Mr. Banana.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He's eating bananas.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's wrong.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Please draw one.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a child.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's a part that looks like Kin-chan in Downtown.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's wrong.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's good.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Which is Power Man?

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Number two.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Number two came.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Number two came.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's no number two.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Parco.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Birdman.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Birdman.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's Par.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's Par.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm hungry.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What about you?

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I like it.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I see.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then you can go home with your nose in number two.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's open it.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's good.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Parco, will you draw?

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You did a good job.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I want you to win.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's my first time.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Please draw.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Congratulations.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you very much.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll do my best.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Parco.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I took a taxi the other day.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I fell down.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't fall down sometimes.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm a driver with a side injury.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't stand sitting down.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't stand it.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Someone has experience.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't stand it.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You have to clean the car once a month.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It doesn't matter if you have a side injury.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It doesn't matter.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't stand it.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't stand it.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I want you to sit in the passenger seat.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't stand it.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll come like this.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll come here with the wind.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I want you to sit in the passenger seat.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want you to run in the back seat.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can't stand it.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
First of all, you have to check if you have a side injury.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's right.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a job where you get to know people.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You have to fix that.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There are two types of side injuries.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I...

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't say it like you're in a fight.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have a side injury, Jin.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't have a side injury at all, Jin.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm afraid of people I don't know.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't know.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They are...

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you don't know the driver you're in a fight with?

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't know.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I have a side injury.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't have a side injury at all, do you?

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You'll be surprised.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The other day, I went to the theater.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
For about three days.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There was a Kenyan dancer there.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A six-man dancer.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He had a side injury that couldn't be seen.

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He had a side injury that couldn't be seen.

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Come here.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He was surrounded by those guys in the elevator.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not a side injury.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's a major injury.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a side injury.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He's a dancer.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He's not wearing a jacket.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It looks like straw pants.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a side injury.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's not wearing any clothes.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No way.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
His hair is covered with a transparent wig.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know if he's wearing a wig.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know if he's wearing a wig.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll give you another example.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He was surrounded by those guys in the elevator.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's not a side injury.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's a major injury.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What?

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's not a side injury.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It looks like it's going to come off.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not like it's going to come off.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It looks like it's going to come off.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a smell I've never smelled before.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's going to fill you up.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's going to fill you up.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's going to explode.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was so smelly.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was so smelly.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It became a hot topic among comedians.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I said, do something about it.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I said, do something about it.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then the director of the theater said,

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When Japanese people go on stage,

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
we always have to dance to this.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I gave him my Eto Four.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I said, oh, thank you.

214
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They kept going.

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But he didn't listen!

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He didn't listen to Eto Four.

217
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Eto Four

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Eto Four

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Eto Four

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He didn't listen to Eto Four.

221
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He didn't listen to Eto Four.

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He didn't listen to Eto Four.

223
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He didn't listen to Eto Four.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What?

225
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What Eto Four?

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, this class is higher than Eto Four.

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You can't do it with a single line.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't do it.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It means that both of you need 10,000 yen.

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I need 80,000 and 40,000 yen.

231
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can't do it.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is how you dance.

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How was the audience?

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is amazing.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Half of the audience was smelly.

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Everyone wasn't enjoying it.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They weren't enjoying it at all.

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They were looking at me like this.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But I heard that Charlie and Hama got 5 bad smells.

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It was worse than usual.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's the way it is.

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It was smelly.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The stage and the audience.

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's right.

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It was worse than usual.

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Charlie didn't care.

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The other day...

248
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I couldn't stand Wada Akiko pulling and turning.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It was terrible.

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know the show,

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Joushiki Hijoushiki?

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We did it on Sunday, right?

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It was a party.

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was at the very end.

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I went to get a drink.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When I was at the very end,

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the bingo started.

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I got a lead.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was happy.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I said,

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, let's go get a drink today.

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's what I said.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's right.

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Matsumoto, Matsumoto.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hamada wants to go get a drink.

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I didn't say anything.

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You said that.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then Roppongi grabbed Hamada.

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And I grabbed him.

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I couldn't stop.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I was waiting for the signal.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There were two girls in front of me.

273
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I yelled at them.

274
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You yelled?

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's amazing.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was listening to you.

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Suddenly,

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I yelled.

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I yelled.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I yelled.

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I said,

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's rare for two people to be together.

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You brought them here.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's amazing.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't drink.

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't drink.

287
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Izumi was there.

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I told her to come back at 12.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I can't drink.

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was drinking a cup of wine.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I was drinking a cup of wine.

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was drinking eight cups.

293
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was drinking eight cups.

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I was drinking eight cups.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was drinking eight cups.

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I was talking.

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I was repeating the same thing.

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was singing karaoke.

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was singing one chorus.

300
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I said, Stop.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Izumi sang four bars.

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Stop.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's amazing.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Shinsen came later.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Shinsen started singing.

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We were singing together.

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He was terrible at singing.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He was terrible at singing.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He was terrible at singing.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He was terrible at singing.

311
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I said, I'm going home.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He said, You're leaving early tomorrow.

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He said, I'll be home in 30 minutes.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Shinsuke put out a envelope.

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He said, Write a contract.

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He said, I'll be home in 30 minutes.

317
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He was dragged in the middle of the road.

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He was dragged in the middle of the road.

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Poor Izumi.

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Shinsuke said,

321
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let's go home.

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go home.

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Izumi was just laughing.

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Izumi was just laughing.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Izumi was laughing.

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Izzumi was not laughing at all.

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go home.

328
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Izzumi got beat up.

329
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Izzumi was beaten up.

330
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Izzumi was beaten up.

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Izzumi was beaten up.

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Izzumi was beaten up.

333
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Izzumi was beaten up.

334
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We had a lot of fun.

335
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We had a lot of fun.

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We had a lot of fun.

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You said something at the end.

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I had so much fun.

339
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It was raining a lot.

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Everyone went home.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Itsumi, Akiko-san, and the manager were here.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They all went home.

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We were at the bottom of the store, on the stairs.

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We said, hello.

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They said, over there...

346
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hamada, we're here!

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We have something to talk to you about!

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What is this?

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If you don't say anything, we'll leave.

350
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's right!

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We don't know what to do.

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No way!

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What was that last word?

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I wonder what it was.

355
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's scary.

356
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But it was fun.

357
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
With you and...

358
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's right.

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It was really fun.

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It was really fun.

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, again...

362
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I want to go.

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Once every four years.

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Please write it down.

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's enough.

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hello.

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Hello.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't have a resume today.

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes.

370
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you have a job?

371
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes, I do.

372
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What's your name?

373
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
My name is Mari Akiyama.

374
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How old are you?

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm 22.

376
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What are you doing?

377
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm working.

378
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're working?

379
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thank you very much.

380
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Thank you very much.

381
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
By the way, I'm going to see a doctor I really hate.

382
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The other day, when I was paying, I saw an eye on a cart in front of me.

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
On the cart, it said,

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
An unknown cart.

385
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
On that cart, there were more carts than any other cart.

386
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I was surprised for a moment and made a reservation for the next time.

387
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But I got scared and decided to buy it from another doctor.

388
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Do you two have something like this?

389
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The other day, I wanted to stay in Osaka for a while.

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I went to my house in Nitta.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I asked the doctor to look for a doctor near the main office.

392
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There was one.

393
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It was a local doctor, but he said,

394
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you sure?

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
When I went there, I came to the front of the hospital.

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When I saw the hospital, I couldn't stand it anymore.

397
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It was all worn out.

398
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I felt like I was in Shimura-ken.

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you wear something like this, it's Shimura-ken.

400
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There was a place where I could get a doctor like that.

401
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I was relieved and went home.

402
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not a local doctor, but...

403
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There was a scab here.

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's called ganglion.

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Do you know?

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know what ganglion is.

407
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That doctor has a bad tongue.

408
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What's wrong?

409
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It hurts.

410
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a scab.

411
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's a scab.

412
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Ganglion.

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What?

414
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I thought it was a ganglion.

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a bad tongue.

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've had a lot of blood.

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can say it now.

418
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
About half a year ago,

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I had a pimple.

420
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You were taking medicine.

421
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes, I had a pimple.

422
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't have a scab.

423
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I met you in a dream.

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I went between the birds.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You went between the birds.

426
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I went between the birds.

427
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You went between the birds.

428
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There is a place like that.

429
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I went to a bandage shop.

430
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's right.

431
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Sorry.

432
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I washed it in the drain next to the bandage shop.

433
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I went out of the room.

434
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I didn't notice.

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What are you asking?

436
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm worried about you.

437
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm worried about you.

438
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm worried about you.

439
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm worried about you.

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm worried about you.

441
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm worried about you.

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm worried about you.

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's your birthday, isn't it?

444
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't need to hear that.

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Mayonnaise.

446
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's true.

447
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't like the way you say it.

448
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I always say that you don't like fish.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What do you hate so much?

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I hate fish, too.

451
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What is that?

452
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Do you like fish?

453
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What is your favorite food?

454
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I like this kind of food.

455
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What do you like?

456
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What is the best food in the world?

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a yellowtail teriyaki.

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's the worst.

460
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If I had that, I would eat as much as I want.

461
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You killed it, but you didn't cook it.

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's the cooking method.

463
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It can't be helped.

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's a terrible story.

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What is it?

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I like Ace Cook's wonton noodles.

467
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Isn't it?

468
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't think it's good.

469
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What kind of ramen do you like?

470
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I like chicken ramen.

471
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why are you shaking?

472
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I didn't know you liked chicken ramen.

473
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Ace Cook's wonton noodles are better than chicken ramen.

474
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I think it's good.

475
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I've never thought Ace Cook's wonton noodles were good.

476
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But chicken ramen became a cup.

477
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What?

478
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's different.

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ace Cook's wonton noodles became a cup. That's different, too.

480
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You can't do that.

481
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You can't boil it in a pot.

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But it's hard to throw away Hon Chuka.

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I've been eating Sapporo Ichiban for a long time.

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What does Sapporo Ichiban taste like?

485
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It tastes like soy sauce.

486
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I like miso ramen.

487
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Japanese people don't like miso ramen.

488
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Japanese people don't like it.

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Egg rice is the best.

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Egg rice is delicious.

491
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't need egg rice and UFO.

492
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can't stand it.

493
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm thinking of having dinner.

494
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Egg rice and UFO.

495
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Good evening.

496
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is the ending.

497
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Next week, September 24th is the 100th anniversary of Gaki no Tsukai.

498
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
100th anniversary.

499
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's broadcast live next week on September 24th.

500
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We'll broadcast live from 1.40 to 2.10.

501
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Actually, next week's live broadcast is the last episode of Gaki no Tsukai.

502
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's the last episode.

503
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's right.

504
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The last episode of Gaki no Tsukai will be broadcast from 1.40.

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And on October 20th, it will be broadcast on Sunday.

506
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It will be a shocking TV box.

507
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's one reason.

508
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Gaki no Tsukai will be broadcast from 11 o'clock.

509
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's right.

510
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Will the title change?

511
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Gaki no Tsukai will not be broadcast.

512
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Gaki no Koshizukai will not be broadcast.

513
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's an adult video.

514
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I can't watch it.

515
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't watch it.

516
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Next week is the last episode of Gaki no Tsukai.

517
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And tonight is the last episode.

518
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm looking forward to it. See you next week.

519
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:59,000
