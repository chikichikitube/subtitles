1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What are you doing?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It seems that there are no more customers today.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's make it a signboard.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I was busy today too.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's been three months since she left this house.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There is no signboard.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What makes her the best entertainer in Japan?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I hope that

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
she will be

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the best

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
entertainer in Japan.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't like it.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You!

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I kicked you just now.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What do you mean you kicked me just now?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You didn't even contact me.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's been a long time since I drank.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please give me a drink.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are you drinking again?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I told you to give me a drink.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Give me a drink!

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Shut up!

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I got it.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just one drink.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You!

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Give me money again!

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You idiot!

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't want that money!

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Shut up!

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You!

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Actually, I have something to tell you.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In my

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
stomach,

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
there is your baby.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
At the corner of a nameless north street,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the falling snow is

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
tears.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There is no woman

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
who is happy,

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but the cold night breeze is

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
blowing.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to live with a man

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
who is tired.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even such a small dream

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and this unreachable body

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
are painful.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Even for me,

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I chase

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
my dreams.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When I'm by your side,

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
there is a man

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
who laughs at your thoughts.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What kind of you are you?

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If I don't see you,

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
if my dreams don't bloom,

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll die.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You are the only one who can guide me

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to the end of this world.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Can you bring me the finish?

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, it's coming out!

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How many times have we done this show today?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We've done more than 50 times.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, really?

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How many times have we done this show?

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Please forgive us for today.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's hard.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to faint.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry for today.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When we talk,

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we get excited.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's strange.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Today is...

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please forgive us.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please forgive us.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What time is it now?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's 10 o'clock.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's too early!

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Too early!

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Recently,

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know how and where

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I made a mistake.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
At home,

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
there is a drink.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Isn't it a drink?

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's not a drink. It's a drink.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's the cause?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know where it came from.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't it around here?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not a drink.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not a drink.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I found it.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know the difference.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I know what a drink is.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you know how much

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
my house is full of drinks?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's amazing.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
My cat,

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chosuke.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's that?

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My cat.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
My cat, Chosuke,

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
was full of drinks.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was called the Al-Taro.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That was the cause of the drinking at home.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It was the cause of the drinking at home.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I put water in the pot.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I told him not to put it all in.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I told him not to put water in his ears.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I told him not to put it in his ears.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I put it in my ears until here.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was with my brother for a while.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I still can't forget it.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The drink in my body was in my face.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Gaa!

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
My brother and I

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Gaa!

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Stop it.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Stop it.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I put it in my ears.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If I put it in my ears,

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll die.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you put it in your ears,

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you'll die, but it's not scary.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not scary at all.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Gaa!

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Chosuke

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Gaa!

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's not scary at all.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not scary at all.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've never been scared.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've never been broken.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've been broken many times.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why? Is it because it's dirty?

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My body?

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If your body is dirty,

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you're dirtier.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's not about dirt.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's about what I've done so far.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you say that,

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
you're dirtier.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's all.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm really sorry.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm really sorry.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not like that.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, no, no, no.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's pretty good.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I didn't do anything.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't say that.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What are you?

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The audience won't laugh.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can't go down and hit the audience.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's what you do as an angel.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can't go down and hit the audience.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm talking, but I'm talking.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just said,

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shut up.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How much did you pay?

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I paid 2,000 yen.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you have a wallet?

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you have a wallet?

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll do this.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Stop it.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's what I do.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't say that.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why are you making a fuss?

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because it's so bad.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know what it is.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know what it is.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You did it, didn't you?

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't do any money.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's it.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was playing a game.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Shut up.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I went back.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Shut up.

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I went back.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
My hat flew off.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You hit him from behind.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You hit him from behind.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My hat flew off.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You hit him from behind.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Stop it.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop it.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's why.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't care what you say.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't care what you say.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You hit him with a bell.

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You hit him with a bell.

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You hit him with a bell.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Think about the person who appeared.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Think about the person who appeared.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Me.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Old man.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Money.

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's all I can say.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You are the worst.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You are the worst.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have been hit.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have been hit.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have been hit.

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's bad for hat.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's bad for hat.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's nothing to you.

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's nothing to you.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Really?

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not so bad even though I think.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm not so bad even though I think.

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm not bad. I'm the worst, right?

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, yeah.

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're the worst.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, I'm not bad.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who's bad?

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Old man.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Obviously, it's the old man.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're the worst after the old man.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Who's the worst after the old man?

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's not me.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Who's the worst after the old man?

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
2,000 yen?

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not me.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who's the worst after the old man?

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I wanted to hit him a little more, but I stopped him.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Who's the worst after the old man?

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That old man should have hit him one more time.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
One more time?

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, I didn't hit him.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I hit him one more time.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, I hit him like this.

237
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I won.

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't do that to me.

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I've never done that.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
First of all, I think I'll definitely be killed in that world.

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's no doubt that I'll be killed in that world.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When I'm killed in that world, I'll definitely be an angel.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know that.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You'll be an angel.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll be an angel.

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I know that I'll go to heaven.

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know if you'll go to hell, but you're wearing something weird.

248
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
My way of thinking is that when humans are born, they give birth to a few points.

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you do something bad, the points will be deducted.

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's like a license.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's like a license.

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There's something like 5,000 points, right?

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Where did you get 5,000 points from?

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you die without using these 5,000 points, you'll go to heaven.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You don't have any more than 900 points.

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Me?

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Here.

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because when you stole the gasoline...

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's enough.

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't know if I'm talking to you properly.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why?

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
My feet stink, so I'll give you another 500 points.

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, it doesn't stink.

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
My feet stink.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
My feet stink.

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I said so.

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You said that you didn't want to get off the horse because of the polo socks.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
My feet stink.

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't ride it.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let me get off.

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I always watch the two of you on TV.

273
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's about my father. One day, I was walking on the street and I met a foreigner and I stepped on his foot.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I should apologize for that, but after that, my father said,

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Thank you.

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He is my father, what do you think?

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What do you think?

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Before that, I went to Los Angeles. When I went there, there was a coordinator there.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He said, It's okay if you can speak English, because you understand Japanese.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was like, really?

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So I went out and brought my luggage.

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He was a very strong American.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He was wearing glasses, and he was the coordinator.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He came to me and said, Didn't you sell the plane?

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, I did.

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Are you okay?

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's Osaka's plane.

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, it is.

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Foreigners in Japan should think about mastering Japanese a little more.

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You don't have to study Japanese.

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No, I don't need it at all.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
After a few years, I think the whole world should be in Japanese.

293
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
More than that,

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What?

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think the whole world should be in Osaka dialect.

296
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is serious.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There is no word that can convey emotions as much as Osaka dialect.

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Can you help me a little?

299
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't want to help you.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Help me.

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm telling you to help me.

302
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm tired. Help me.

303
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If you tell me that, I think I have to do something about it.

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think so, too.

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think the whole world should be in Osaka dialect.

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Please listen to the fact that I saw when I was 18 years old.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think it was about 10 years ago when Go Hiromi was still in the talent show.

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
When I was watching Go Hiromi on TV, Hiromi started swimming like a man.

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When the underwater camera caught Hiromi, I saw it.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The water from Hiromi's nose was dripping.

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He was swimming.

312
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
At that time, he was swimming with a smile as usual.

313
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My childhood heart was deeply hurt.

314
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I thought that an idol's nose is water.

315
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's a big solution.

316
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I see.

317
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hiromi is also a human being, so he doesn't have to show his nose.

318
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But those people are good at their looks.

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So it's okay to cry when you win an award.

320
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But if an idol singer cries with a dirty face, it's a nose.

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I have to stop crying.

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When an idol singer's nose comes out, it gets cold.

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If you have a dirty nose, your teeth will come out.

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Half of your teeth are normal, and half of your teeth are gold.

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Crying with a short nose.

326
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
All your noses are the same.

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How many times have you had a nose like this?

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not good to have a nose like this.

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's not good to have a nose like this.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You have to be careful.

331
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Where did I put my teeth?

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I put my teeth like this.

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I put my teeth like this.

334
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Where did I put my teeth?

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I forgot where I put my teeth.

336
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You have thick teeth.

337
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Maybe it's because of that.

338
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Maybe it's because of that.

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You have thick teeth.

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
There was a story in the newspaper that a giant bought Masao.

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I found something amazing.

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Picky Kyoko.

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I understand your feelings, but don't contact me.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Dad, Mom.

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Is it a daughter?

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's a daughter, right?

347
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Are you talking about Picky Kyoko?

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm talking about Picky's parents.

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm talking about Picky's house.

350
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Are you talking about Kyoko?

351
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm talking about Picky Kyoko.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Are you talking about Picky?

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's right.

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It says Dad and Mom.

355
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's right.

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It says Picky in Katakana.

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's right.

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are you talking about?

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If it's half, it's Picky Kyoko.

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But there's something else before that.

361
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Kimura Picky Kyoko?

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Isn't that strange?

363
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's not it.

364
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There's no Picky Kyoko.

365
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's not it.

366
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Isn't that a comedian?

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's not it.

368
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I think you were given the name Picky Kyoko.

369
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
While you were born.

370
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Kyoko.

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
No, it's Picky Kyoko.

372
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okubo Picky Kyoko.

373
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm glad I said that.

374
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're talking about Okubo Picky Kyoko.

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm talking about Okubo Picky Kyoko.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We're friends.

377
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's the problem.

378
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Picky Kyoko is my name.

379
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Why did you write it like that?

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I asked my mom and dad why I called her Picky Kyoko.

381
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But that was to do my best.

382
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Where?

383
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
To make me feel good.

384
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's Picky.

385
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's Picky.

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I said I wanted to call her Picky.

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But she jumped out of the room.

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So I understood her feelings.

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I called her.

390
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't get it.

391
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why don't you get it?

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But Picky Kyoko said she felt good.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So I called her.

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's all I can say.

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
At my grandfather's funeral,

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I saw his nose hair in the coffin.

397
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I pulled it out because I was curious.

398
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then I went home.

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm going to kill you.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm going to kill you.

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No way.

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm going to kill you.

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I pulled it out because I was curious.

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm going to kill you.

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going to kill you.

406
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is a common thing.

407
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
My grandfather died.

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
My grandfather was killed.

409
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He had a squid.

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But his nose hair was longer than I thought.

411
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
His nose hair was longer than I thought.

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He was usually full of cotton.

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
His cotton was so white that it was stuffed.

414
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
His cotton was so white that it was stuffed.

415
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If there was a Grim Reaper,

416
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
When he died,

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He was wrapped in a veil.

418
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He was wrapped in a veil.

419
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But if his nose hair was longer than I thought,

420
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He couldn't be wrapped.

421
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Do you understand?

422
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's a veil here.

423
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's a foreign object that's coming out of the veil.

424
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
When I pulled this out,

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is just my grandfather.

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
My grandfather who was killed in that world.

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It was between heaven and the human world.

428
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
When I pulled this out,

429
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
My grandfather was naturally...

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Look at me now.

431
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Here, here.

432
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He was naturally wrapped in a veil.

433
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You're annoying.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's what I said.

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sure there are people like this.

436
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Even if you think you're dead, you should try it once.

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's right.

438
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There's a lot of traffic accidents.

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You hit something and hit your head.

440
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's already broken and it's coming out.

441
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What? Your brain?

442
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's right.

443
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you hit your head and you're about to collapse,

444
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Call me.

445
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Call me.

446
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm desperate.

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Even if your heart stops?

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's right.

449
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You called me.

450
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I was reading a book of someone who came back alive.

451
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
How did you read it?

452
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
When I woke up, I was walking in the dark.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There's a light in the front.

454
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I was walking.

455
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
For example, if I was reading,

456
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How should I call you?

457
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's not a problem.

458
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Accidents don't collapse.

459
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's not a problem.

460
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's not a problem.
