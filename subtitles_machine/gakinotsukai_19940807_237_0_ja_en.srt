1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Youkai

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Unusual creatures living all over Japan since ancient times

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No one has seen them even though they have always been in contact with the human world

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good evening

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Youkai

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can't see youkai in Japan

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Some people have seen ghosts

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We are going to do a ghost test soon

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Youkai

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Youkai are disappearing

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are 5.6 million youkai in Japan

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's a lot

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's a lot

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's a lot

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Don't make me laugh

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I brought you this

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's worth 300 million yen

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's worth 300 million yen

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He is strange

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is a water purifier

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's worth 500 million yen

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How much is it?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm borrowing it

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This T-shirt is worth 2 million yen

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's a normal decoder

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's a decoder

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Today is a very hot day in Tokyo

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is my usual attitude

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Youkai's happiness

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm getting nervous

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm getting nervous

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There is a youkai in this bus

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Look at the back

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look at this

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Youkai ghost

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is that?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What is that?

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Look at that

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What is that in the middle?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is this a youkai?

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's get off

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you serious?

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come on

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is this a youkai?

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't get too close

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is this?

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is a youkai cat girl

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She is the richest girl in the youkai world

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She is good at selling people's rice at a farmer's rice field

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Youkai cat girl

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't look back

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Youkai is acting like a good boy

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to hit you

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is this?

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm scared

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go together

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm really scared

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I didn't think I would see a cat girl today

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What is that?

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's shining from the outside

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you okay?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Be careful

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What is that?

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What is that?

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What is that?

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What is this?

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What is this?

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The young man's favorite

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He is the most dangerous youkai

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He has many tricks

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Youkai cat girl

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is a bad guy

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is a bad guy

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is dirty

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is a bad guy

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What is this?

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Stop it

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is a dirty youkai

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who is dirty?

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Osaka

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is Osaka's youkai

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Get the water from the other side

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He is a good guy

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Get him

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing?

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm just wiping

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is dangerous

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is really dangerous

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is an interesting youkai

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where can you find such a beautiful youkai?

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is dirty

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is dirty

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is a youkai with a voice

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can hear your voice

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's go again

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is dangerous

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The average age is too high

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Come here

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Two or three people

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What is this?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What is this?

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What is this?

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is a youkai from Akita

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Youkai from Akita

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He is a young youkai

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He is a young youkai

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He is a young youkai

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He is a young youkai

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He is a youkai

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is still running

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He is being scolded

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He will make me laugh

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm getting angry

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is being scolded

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Gunshot

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't laugh

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can't laugh

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't laugh

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is dangerous

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to smoke

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What having from a cigarette

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm getting embarrassed

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is not good

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Look at this

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You shouldn't be scared like this

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There is a boss character

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Really?

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What? I can hear laughter

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hard wheel?

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He is a former comedian, but he is pursuing the beauty of men

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He is a hard wheel

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He likes women and alcohol

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He is the number one bad guy

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He is the night king

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This eel

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Eel?

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hamamatsu

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What?

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What are you doing?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you a youkai?

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is this?

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is fun

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Do you have a barbell?

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Try to make a joke with this

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Ok

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Can you beat this youkai?

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This barbell

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Idiot

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This youkai is good at attacking

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Stop it

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is a professional skill

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Harper nice day

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Harper day?

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't you know?

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Harper nice day

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's go

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Can I die without reading this?

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It won't break

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't think it will break

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The youkai that I know

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They used to be tough

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But this time it won't work

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What do you mean?

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What is that?

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's sliding

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What is that?

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is a barbell

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is a barbell

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is this?

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can you sing a song?

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You are a youkai

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Youkai

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What youkai

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What?

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The Japanese youkai has 5.6 million followers

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because of this youkai the youkai can't do anything

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The boss character youkai

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
My face is nervous

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm nervous

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You are nervous

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If you hug me it's over

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You won't say anything funny

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Can I wear this?

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a mino

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is a mino

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I see

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's hard

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Can you lower the zipper?

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Lower the zipper

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What do you think?

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I lowered it

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This is a zipper

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What?

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll wash it

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm a bit fat

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You are noisy

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I lost

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Where does it disappear?

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Run to the other side

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Youkai run to the other side

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yamada kun

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is the worst

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It was scary

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How did you deal with it?

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I did a lot of things

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is the bottom

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's go home

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There are still many youkai living in the human world

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They might be next to you

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's hard to do a broadcast at this time

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why?

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's hot

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm tired

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's really hot today

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
How many degrees?

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
30?

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
39?

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
39 degrees

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
39 degrees is 80

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
80?

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Did you pass by the sun?

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Anyone can pass by

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Everyone can pass by

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Anyone can pass by

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What is it?

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I forgot to tell you

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There is an event

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What event?

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
An event for 24 hours

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You?

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's on this show

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I think you'll get a address

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Send me a letter

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll contact you personally

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If I say I'll do it here

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There will be people who don't care

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I see

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't contact you

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's do it together

255
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't want to do it

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The audience is tired

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
People say I'm like Matsumoto

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
When the audience is tired

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can do it too

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can do it too

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're standing here

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't get me wrong

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm your grandmother

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Really?

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's how it is

268
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm old

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're old

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You have to think about it

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why are you lecturing me?

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You have to put your elbow on the side

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
On the elbow?

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You can put it on the elbow

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't put it on the elbow

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Listen

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I can't

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I can't put it on the elbow

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Everyone does this

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do it

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't get fat

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You suddenly got fat

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're talking and you're like

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're talking and you're like

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll put it on my eye

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't care

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't care

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But you're a bit more thin

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Has it changed recently?

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Did it rain?

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Rain?

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Rain

294
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Is it okay?

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's okay

296
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Tokyo is also bad now

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's going to rain

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's going to rain

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You can't trust the news 100%

301
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They exaggerate

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's not true

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's no harm in exaggerating

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's no harm in exaggerating

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The news is explained in the video

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no water

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There is

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's how it is

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They exaggerate

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They do?

312
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's not true

313
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's not true

314
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Something's wrong with you

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're talking while looking at me

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's not a lie

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's not true

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're a fool

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're a samurai

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm a country boy but I'm not a samurai

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The capital of Tokyo is

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't know

326
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The capital of Tokyo

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The capital of Tokyo is

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is it okay?

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The capital of Tokyo isn't just one

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There are several

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They only show the part where the sun rises

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's all there is

334
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There isn't

335
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's why

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
How many percent is there in Tokyo?

337
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There are places where there isn't

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Like Shikoku

339
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They say there's no water

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But the people of Tokyo

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why are you eating sushi?

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I know there's no water

343
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why are you eating sushi?

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You can't eat sushi

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's not sushi

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You can't even make Indian food

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You think everything is sushi

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you do this it's sushi

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't think so

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What do you mean?

351
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There is water

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There isn't

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There is

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There is

355
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There is

356
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There is

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There is

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There isn't

359
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There isn't

360
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why are you saying there isn't

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There isn't

362
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There is

363
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There is

364
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There is

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There isn't

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There isn't

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There isn't

368
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll change the topic

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
High school students now say they're scared

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They used to be scared

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They used to be scared

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Really?

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They used to be scared

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Are you going to sing for us now?

376
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Are you going to sing for us?

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
High school students didn't have a place to sell their underwear

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
They just couldn't sell it

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If they had a place to sell it they would have sold it

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Really?

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's what they say

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Everyone believes that

384
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Someone said it's 39 degrees

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But it isn't

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can tell just by looking

387
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You shouldn't be fooled

388
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can tell just by looking

389
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They say it's summer

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But it's not that summer

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's summer

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's summer

393
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's summer

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's summer

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's summer

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's just that feeling

397
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can say it's downtown

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But it's not that downtown

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There are a lot of students today

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There are a lot of students today

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There are too many I'm getting lost

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Mom

404
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't fly

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The adults are looking at me

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The adults are looking at me

407
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The adults are looking at me

408
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What should I say?

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What should I say?

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It doesn't matter

411
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is serious

412
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm not being shy

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You thought I was cute right?

414
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You?

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You can really say that

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You thought I was cute right?

417
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You thought I was cute right?

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You thought I was cute right?

419
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You thought I was cute right?

420
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You thought I was cute right?

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You thought I was cute right?

422
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Really

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What is that?

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What is that?

426
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This?

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No, I'm fine

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Why do people turn into evil faces when they smell?

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why do people turn into evil faces when they smell?

430
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can say this

431
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can't smell anything when I'm laughing

432
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You are also a prince of a very erotic country

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You've smelled women's underwear right?

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm also like that

436
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Can't you laugh at that time?

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, I can't laugh until here

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
When I can't laugh

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You can't do anything about it

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I can't do anything about it

441
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't laugh until here

442
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You can't laugh like that

443
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Humans are like the car's change

444
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's a neutral situation

445
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
When you smell, you make it neutral

446
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And you decide if it smells or not

447
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And if it smells, you do it

448
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's a very erotic situation

449
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If it smells, you go in 5th gear

450
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What do you mean by a very erotic situation?

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't understand

452
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If it smells a lot

453
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's right

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I said if it smells a lot

455
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If it smells a lot

456
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What is that?

457
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What is that?

458
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What is that?

459
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There are many trucks behind my house

460
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
One of them turns to the left

461
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
One of them turns to the left

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The truck says something

463
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What is the purpose of this truck?

464
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The truck is a truck

465
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's dangerous because it turns to the left

466
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's dangerous because it turns to the left

467
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If you say that, it will stop

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That's right

469
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The truck has a trick

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A trick?

471
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
A trick

472
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's not a trick

473
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a deadly trick

474
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Kamen Rider

475
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What is Kamen Rider's deadly trick?

476
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Rider Kick

477
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Rider Kick

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Rider Kick

479
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's similar

480
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Where is it?

481
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Rider's deadly trick

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Rider Kick

483
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Rider's deadly trick

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's a deadly trick

485
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Rider's deadly trick is Rider Kick

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Truck's deadly trick is Rider Kick

487
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's strange

488
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I understand

489
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I understand what you said

490
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's get to the point

491
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
When Kamen Rider does Rider Kick

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He doesn't kick without saying anything

493
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Before he kicks

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What is that?

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What is that?

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Before he kicks

497
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Rider Kick

498
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The truck says

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's go, Nailin

500
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It turns to the left
