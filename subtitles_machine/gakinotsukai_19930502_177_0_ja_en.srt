1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the 5th episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Tsukitsuki Ogiri Daigasu!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am Hamada Masatoshi.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the 5th episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Tsukitsuki Ogiri Daigasu!

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Please introduce yourself one by one.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I am Yamasaki Bankaku.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sexy-san, please have fun.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am Team Zero Noriasu.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Today, I am invited to this place.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't be noisy.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't get lost.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mo mo mo mo mo.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What is that?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Golden Week is coming soon.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Everyone will go to many places.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will go to my favorite New York.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Nakamashi.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mo mo mo mo mo.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mo mo mo mo mo.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Atakamo Reading!

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The topic of today's Atakamo Reading is this.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Japan Passing.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Passing?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's about economics.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Japan Passing is about passing cars.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Passing is the first thing.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's the first thing.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But this is not a hole-in-one.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The bubble burst and real estate prices rise and become cheaper.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Which one?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Which one?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will write about this in detail later.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will go to the next page.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Until now, there was a lot of nonsense.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But from now on, let's work seriously.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Because...

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What is the meaning of trade fraud?

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you ask what it is...

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What is that?

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
According to the court, it's not worth 200,000 yen.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There must be more money.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The money...

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's not enough.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not enough?

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not enough.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Give it to me.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Japan Passing is dead.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But I don't know what kind of enemy will attack next.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Good luck, Japan Passing.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Japan Passing is dead.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can I change the order?

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's change.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yamazaki, you can't.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's change.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yamazaki and I will change.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This guy is the worst.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yamazaki is the worst.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then...

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yamazaki is here.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then...

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know at all.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hitoshi,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
do you want to drink or not?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hitoshi,

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
do you want to drink or not?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hitoshi,

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Give me a break already!

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hitojichi!

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hitojichi!

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Give me a break already!

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is that so?

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Of course it is!

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Prank!

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Give me a break already!

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Give me a break already!

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The answer is this!

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hitojichi no baka o kan!

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This guy's way of saying it is a bit French!

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's strange!

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The answer is this!

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now, let's have Pea and Noriasu do it together.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yamazaki vs. Noriasu.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ready!

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That outfit suits you well!

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait a minute!

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're admitting it!

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you give it to me, I'll give it to you!

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Can I say it?

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yamazaki, ready!

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's like it's raining!

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your hairstyle is similar to Hamada-san's!

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're so funny!

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yamagata's girlfriend is Genki!

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Your girlfriend is Genki?

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you doing?

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Konnichiwa!

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You can't do that!

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You can't do that!

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You can't do that!

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Good morning!

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Speak!

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Speak!

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't want to do it with this guy!

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now, Jimmy vs. Noriasu.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jimmy, Noriasu is hard to do!

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Noriasu, ready!

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Jimmy, do your best!

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You do your best too!

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Jimmy, do your best too!

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Everyone, are you ready?

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
From now on,

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
one by one,

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
here,

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in the middle, put your head out.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll give you a topic.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If you can make a joke with that topic,

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
raise your hand.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yamazaki-kun!

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yamazaki-kun's

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
topic is here!

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yamazaki-kun!

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yamazaki-kun!

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Put your head out!

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Put your head out!

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Put your head out!

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What's going on?

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Put your head out!

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I feel tired...

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Pick up the ball!

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Slow down!

143
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,060
I am a vomitting baby because of too much heavy spray.

144
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,400
It made me die but I did not give up and continued to fight.

145
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,180
Please appreciate my savage personality.

146
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,280
But I was rather surprised.

147
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
What the hell!

148
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
What the hell!

149
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Ladies and gentlemen.

150
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,280
We have to think about the opening.

151
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,280
I have a bad feeling.

152
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
It smells too much.

153
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,280
It's strange. It feels like a little man is walking on the table.

154
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,280
The audience seems to be tired.

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Time is time.

156
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
We have to get up early and go home.

157
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
What's the matter?

158
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Everyone is going to take a break.

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
It's okay.

160
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
It's okay.

161
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Is there anyone who is going to take a break?

162
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,280
It's like a poor man.

163
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,280
I'm going back to the Philippines.

164
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Raise your hand.

165
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Raise your hand.

166
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Be careful.

167
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,280
It would be nice if everyone could take a break.

168
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
How long do they take a break?

169
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,280
There are many people who take a break for about two weeks.

170
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
They take a break for seven days.

171
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I feel sorry for them.

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,280
They don't have time to take a break.

173
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I don't know why they take a break for two weeks.

174
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
They don't have time to take a break even if they break the house.

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
I don't do good things if I break the house.

176
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
You are a man.

177
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Everyone is having a hard time.

178
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
You are a man.

179
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Do something.

180
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Everyone is having a hard time.

181
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
I have to find a hobby.

182
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Everyone tells me to do something.

183
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You are telling me to do something.

184
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I am doing something.

185
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
I only do what I have decided.

186
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Everyone tells me to do something.

187
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Everyone tells me to do something.

188
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Everyone tells me to go camping.

189
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Everyone tells me to do something.

190
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I want to buy something.

191
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Do you want to buy a car?

192
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
I want to buy a car.

193
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I want to buy a car.

194
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,280
What are you talking about?

195
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
You are a man.

196
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
I will wear a bandana at that time.

197
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
I want to go camping.

198
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,280
You nicht something with a knife.

199
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
In the fishing, it goes quickly.

200
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,280
The fish Chernobyl пример disappears in a second.

201
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
What are you doing?

202
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I take a rest.

203
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
So you do not do anything else.

204
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
He told me to put some salt now.

205
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
You are the worst man.

206
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
What are you talking about?

207
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
What are you talking about?

208
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
I'm starting to get embarrassed

209
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
I'm starting to get weird

210
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
But you really want to go?

211
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
I don't want to go

212
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Why?

213
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm asking you to go

214
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
What are you going to do?

215
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Fishing

216
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I don't want to go

217
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Why?

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I like you

219
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Why?

220
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Have you ever been to a fishing village?

221
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
No

222
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
I haven't

223
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,280
But we all went to a fishing village

224
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
It was really strong

225
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Everyone said to pull

226
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
It was amazing

227
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Everyone was surprised

228
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
But we didn't get surprised

229
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,280
We were surprised that we couldn't go because of the tires

230
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
It was fun

231
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Take everyone and go

232
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
If it was fun, do you want to go?

233
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
I'll ask and then talk

234
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Camping is fun

235
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
It's a golf club

236
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Don't do that

237
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
What is that?

238
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Are you stupid?

239
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
I'll just say no

240
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Just go

241
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I'll tell you how much fun it is

242
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,280
There are a lot of fun things when you go to the mountains

243
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Fishing and what else

244
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
You go to the mountains and fish?

245
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Let's go fishing more

246
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Do you want to go on a cruiser?

247
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
No

248
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Do you really think so?

249
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Buy a cruiser

250
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Why me?

251
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
You have money

252
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
You have money

253
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
What are you doing?

254
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
You're making friends

255
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
It doesn't matter

256
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
You don't want to buy a cruiser?

257
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,280
If you don't want to buy a camping car, buy a cruiser

258
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Cruiser?

259
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,280
You have to be careful not to sneeze

260
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
You have to take it off

261
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
You have to take it off

262
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
If you have a big hole

263
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:39,280
You have to put a pot in

264
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Buy it yourself

265
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
If you want to buy a cruiser, name it

266
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Why?

267
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
I can't name it

268
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,280
You can name it Natsumi

269
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I don't care

270
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,280
You don't care? What do you mean?

271
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Don't say that

272
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I think it's fun

273
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
You have too many hobbies

274
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,280
You don't do things that celebrities don't do?

275
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,280
You don't go camping?

276
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I don't go camping

277
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Otherwise, the range of the entertainment is narrow

278
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,280
If you go camping, it's natural

279
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,280
It's natural

280
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
If you go camping

281
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,280
What are you doing?

282
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,280
What are you doing?

283
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm just saying

284
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
You can use it

285
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
I can use it

286
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Let's do that

287
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,280
There are women who date

288
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,280
There is a big difference between an out-door woman and an in-door woman

289
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,280
It's really tiring to date an out-door woman

290
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
It's annoying

291
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
It's annoying, I hate it

292
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Women from the sports world are more fun than women from the culture world

293
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
That's completely different

294
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Where are you going?

295
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Did you take a break?

296
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm licking it

297
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Don't lick it

298
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Are you stupid?

299
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Take me somewhere

300
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Where are you going?

301
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
It's getting late

302
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Take the money and go somewhere

303
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Go somewhere

304
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
I'll watch a video at home

305
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Go somewhere

306
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Women are terrible

307
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,280
What should I do?

308
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,280
If you see a video of a jet ski on TV, you can say, ha

309
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
What are you doing?

310
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Just like a jet ski

311
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
It's just like that

312
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
You stupid

313
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm going to cry

314
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm licking it

315
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Do you have that kind of reaction?

316
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,280
A talent is licking an out-door woman

317
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,280
An out-door woman?

318
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I'm licking it

319
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I can't call it affection

320
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
I'll tell you

321
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,280
At the store in the morning, a salaryman puts his hand on his waist and puts the newspaper in his hand

322
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,280
He drinks juice with his hand on his chest and drinks it

323
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Why does he put his hand on his waist and drink it?

324
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Old men drink it like this

325
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,280
He drinks it like this next to Kiyosuku

326
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,280
What's the meaning of this hand on his waist?

327
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
I don't know

328
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,280
When I drink cold milk in the morning, it's bad for my stomach

329
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
When I drink it directly, it's bad for my stomach

330
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,280
That's why I drink it like this

331
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
What?

332
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Your stuff goes in here and comes here

333
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm playing with it

334
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,280
It comes here and comes out

335
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
There's a hole here

336
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,280
If it goes here, it's bad

337
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
That's why I want it to go here

338
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Then it goes like this

339
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,280
There's nothing like this

340
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,280
It can't go through

341
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
That's strange

342
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,280
If you want to say something, say it

343
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,280
What is this?

344
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Get rid of it

345
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:27,280
What is the most expensive thing you've bought?

346
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I don't buy expensive things

347
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
You're really dirty

348
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Why?

349
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Because I've never seen you buy expensive things

350
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,280
You're a loser

351
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Is that so?

352
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
That's right

353
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
You must have left a lot of money

354
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
I didn't leave it

355
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
I left it for you

356
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,280
I used it when it wasn't selling

357
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
You're a bad person

358
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I didn't leave it

359
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,280
It's cool

360
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Even if it's not expensive, I buy it

361
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,280
This is expensive

362
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
This is savings

363
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
This is a gift

364
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,280
This is my rent, this is my electricity bill, this is my monthly allowance

365
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Wait a minute, I'll pay for this too

366
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,280
When you go to a family restaurant

367
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,280
I sometimes eat steak

368
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
When you say medium

369
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,280
I eat Young Hamburg

370
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
This has fried eggs

371
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
I eat

372
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,280
What are you talking about?

373
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
What are you talking about?

374
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm happy when I eat fried eggs

375
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,280
By the way, give me back the 3,000 yen from when I was in middle school

376
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
I remembered again

377
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I didn't borrow it

378
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I definitely borrowed it

379
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
I didn't borrow it

380
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Because it's you

381
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
There is a restaurant called Nagasaki

382
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I went there to buy clothes

383
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,280
When I was looking at clothes

384
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I noticed that Hamada wasn't there

385
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
I went to buy clothes together, but Hamada wasn't there

386
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I went to the top floor, but Hamada

387
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Why?

388
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Hamachon, Hamachon

389
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I don't have enough money

390
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Wait a minute, if you really don't have enough money, I'll tell you right away

391
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Why did you go to the emergency room alone?

392
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,280
That's why I borrowed 3,000 yen

393
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Is it okay?

394
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Is it okay?

395
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
It's okay

396
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm ashamed to say it myself
