1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, everyone is having fun.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ah, everyone is having fun.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah, everyone is having fun.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We didn't have an opening today.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, we played dodgeball.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You lost, didn't you?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, I still have a lot to say about that later.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ah, is that so?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But, it's nothing.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Today, we'll have everyone watch the penalty game.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here you go.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's the time?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Eh, I can't see it.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can't see it.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't see it.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wow!

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a camera!

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's a camera!

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ah, I don't like it.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now, Mr. Matsumoto.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Are you ready?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, the moment I went up and went down, it was a direct hit.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No, I really don't know.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Eh?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't broadcast it.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, it's okay.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When I go out, I get hit a lot.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Really?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why do you play dodgeball with your fans and get a penalty?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, is everyone ready?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We lost, so we don't have time.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now, Mr. Matsumoto.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Good luck!

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wow!

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't like it.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't like it anymore.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wow, 40 meters.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My lips are dry.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't like it anymore.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Wow!

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't like it anymore.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Welcome back!

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't move.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is the most scary song.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's really scary.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to move.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going to move.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where are you going to move?

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to move.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I was really scared.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My lips are dry.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What am I doing?

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to move.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to move.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is so scary.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm going to die.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to die.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to die.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is a real punishment game.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not afraid of Alta's Kikkou-shibari.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is definitely scary.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is this song?

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is this song?

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Omo Ahoonumare

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's fun.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yup.

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You should raise your head.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's like this all the time.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Everyone, try riding it.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Seriously.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's really scary, that roller coaster.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's true.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I knew it just by looking at it.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Actually, it's been out for a week or so.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When Ama-chan decided to go to Parma No. 2,

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I said, if I could go again,

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
if you give me a hint, I'll go again.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So I understood.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And when I came back,

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when I saw that face,

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I couldn't say no.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Seriously,

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
why isn't everyone scared of that?

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't like it either.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I wasn't scared of the roller coaster either.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's true.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I enjoyed it a lot.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was the only one who crashed into it.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why isn't everyone scared of that?

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I couldn't get a good shot of it.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, a good shot...

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Actually, that was my own head.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You have such a beautiful head.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I got hurt on both sides,

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
so I had to take it off.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Really?

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But seriously,

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
everyone is so excited.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know about that, but...

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't like it either.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I moved around a little bit,

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and then...

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't be scared.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm definitely not scared,

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but I was more scared than you.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why?

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's terrible when you get on a roller coaster.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
In a sense,

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't want the staff to think that I got on it.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's not true.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's terrible.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's really terrible.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's not true.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In Osaka,

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
there's a place called Hanshin Park.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a small amusement park.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can fly there.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There's a roller coaster there.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's like a rabbit coaster.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, a rabbit coaster.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a roller coaster.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I got on it,

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
called it,

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and screamed.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then,

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I got hit on my back.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I got hit on my back

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
with a heavy hit.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I got hit on my back

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
with a heavy hit.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And then,

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I lost all my precious memories.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What memories?

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The memories of you and the staff getting on it.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's terrible.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's terrible.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's terrible.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's really terrible.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But,

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that was the last time

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that you were on a roller coaster.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why?

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because it was a long time ago.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you were on a roller coaster in the middle.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you pursue your fear,

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you'll be able to ride more rides.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But, it's still too early.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's not like that.

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But,

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the one that was spinning normally,

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
it developed a little,

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and it started to spin once.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then,

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
it went straight down.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then,

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
there's no more rails.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Probably.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And from here,

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
there's something like a capsule.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And then,

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
boom!

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's using this kind of space.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's like a coaster.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That will come.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's developing little by little.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The one that comes after that,

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
this time,

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
it leaves the material as it is,

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and goes into this capsule

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
with the yakuza.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No,

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the meaning is different.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is also scary.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The meaning is different.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That will be talked about a lot

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
during the ride.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Where did you come from?

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There's a yakuza from the other world.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
When you enter,

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you have a card.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If it's B, then B.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's a B yakuza.

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then,

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
there's that yakuza.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm scared of that.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There's a long story until you fly.

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm being asked a lot.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Sing a song.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm being asked a lot.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
After the ride,

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
boom!

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't say anything.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't care about the story.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's because you're going to lose.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Listen to me.

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What?

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It was in the postcard.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It was a loss for me.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why?

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was wearing the postcard.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was a wind god.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What?

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
A wind god.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The coat?

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's why it's a loss.

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What?

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's why it's a loss.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a loss if you're a wind god.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a loss if you're a wind god.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a loss if you're a wind god.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, no, no.

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a loss.

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't say that.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's a loss.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a loss.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was a wind god.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So what?

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What?

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So what?

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The wind is coming from you.

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know that, right?

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Your fans.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Your fans were there.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And you.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The wind is coming from the other side.

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you guys stink.

237
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know what?

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I was playing a game.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I couldn't play a game because you guys stink.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You should have told me earlier.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's a lie.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You should have told me earlier.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The balls are different.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's not true.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The balls were thrown like that.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The boys were like that.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The girls were like that.

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And you guys were like grass.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The girls were like grass.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was very difficult to move.

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It was very difficult.

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I just don't know.

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It was really difficult to move.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You were running around.

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You got hit and went out.

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
More than that, my health was really bad.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You don't know how bad my health was.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You got hit and went out.

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It was really difficult at that time.

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It was really difficult at that time.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why?

262
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The night before.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why?

264
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The night before.

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I was staying at Yomiuriland Hotel.

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You were staying at Yomiuriland Hotel?

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was staying at Yomiuriland Hotel.

269
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was from 9 a.m.

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The room next to me was shaking.

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I couldn't sleep.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You couldn't sleep?

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Really?

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Really?

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What should I say?

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What should I say?

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You couldn't sleep.

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There were many things.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What things?

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What things?

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You couldn't sleep.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You were an enemy of sports.

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You were an enemy of sports?

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The room next to you was shaking.

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I got it.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You couldn't sleep.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I got it.

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You couldn't sleep.

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you mean?

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you think you mean look at that?

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

293
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Tell me.

294
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What?

295
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Tell me.

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
If you say that.

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Really?

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You are not wrong about getting parched.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll kick you now.

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you hear what I said, you repent your sins.

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't care.

302
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can do it.

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
With a beard, with a beard.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You've done something amazing.

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So what is it?

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yomiuri Land Hotel.

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't have shampoo.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have soap in my head.

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Can you break it?

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But it's painful.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's painful.

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
With soap like this?

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I have soap in my head.

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But it's a small one.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, no.

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The one in front of me is getting bigger.

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's getting bigger.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You have that much in the hotel?

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What does it have to do with which one I lost?

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You didn't show up with shampoo in your head.

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This mental damage.

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's amazing.

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's nothing.

325
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You didn't show up at the store?

326
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No.

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The one with shampoo and conditioner?

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I went to see it.

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I went to the lobby to see if there was shampoo or conditioner.

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I went to see it, but there wasn't.

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There was a game at the game center.

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'll do it.

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why?

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why?

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You went to buy shampoo and conditioner.

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll do it.

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When I see something like this, I don't feel good.

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What game?

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What do you call it?

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Shooting game.

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll do it.

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll do it.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You'll collapse.

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What are you talking about?

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You're going to collapse.

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's settle this properly.

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're going to do it again?

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I have to do it again.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What are you going to do this time?

351
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's a 100th anniversary.

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This broadcast is 85th.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's do something on the 100th broadcast.

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
One idea is to play in Okinawa like last year.

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's one.

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The rest is like this time.

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know which one, but let's gather the money.

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm thinking about how many people will really gather this time.

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I gathered 1000 people and found out.

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
500 of my fans and 500 of your fans.

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
After all, you have a lot of fans.

362
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Did you look at my fans in such detail?

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Did you look at my fans and other people's fans in such detail?

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Your fans are a little strange.

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Your fans are strange.

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Your fans are...

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What is this?

368
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You have a lot of hair.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's a man's hair.

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Even a woman's hair is like that.

371
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Even a woman's hair is tight.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What is tight?

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's pretty tight.

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's called a nose hair bun.

375
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's a nose hair bun.

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
How many times did you do that?

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why did you change the number of the nose hair bun?

378
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I look at dirty things.

379
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You look at the number again, make a phone call, make an appointment.

380
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a nose hair bun.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What is your name?

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
My name is Yuki Oseki.

383
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How old are you?

384
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm 22 years old.

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

386
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't have a boyfriend now.

387
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What is it like?

388
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What is it like to be a comedian?

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I like comedians.

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yuki Oseki.

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What is it?

392
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where is that nose hair bun?

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What is that guy?

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's like a mini bomb.

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's like a nose hair bun.

396
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Bang!

397
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I have a lot of hair.

398
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I have a lot of hair.

399
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have a lot of hair.

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's like a dream.

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Bang!

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Bang!

403
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Bang!

404
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's like a dream.

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Thank you very much.

406
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you very much.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's me.

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Before the postcard.

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The week before.

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The week before.

411
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't really care.

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't care if I get bald.

413
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Right?

414
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Marukome's audition or something.

415
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You did it, right?

416
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If my staff calls Marukome headquarters,

417
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Please come to the audition.

418
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know how many generations of Marukome are there now.

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But if you go to the audition and get chosen,

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
With this body type.

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
With a bald head.

422
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Marukome.

423
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Marukome.

424
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Please give me a break.

425
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If you get chosen,

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You can go to the audition.

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

428
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You don't have to do that.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Bring the camera.

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll go with you.

431
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
On that day,

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
At Kin-chan's time.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There was an audition.

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's make it like a making movie.

435
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Right?

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's go.

437
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you talking about?

438
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What?

439
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm just going to the audition.

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Then you should go too.

441
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What kind of audition?

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You can be bald.

443
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Marukome.

444
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Moon-chan or something.

445
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can dye your hair.

447
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's really a bad idea.

448
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you do that, it will be funny.

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Dye your hair and become Moon-chan.

450
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Are you stupid?

451
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Why?

452
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's not going to happen.

453
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Why?

454
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's funny.

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you dye your hair and come out.

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you do something like an audition,

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I understand.

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Moon-chan.

459
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You can be an assistant.

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You should be Gen-san.

461
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Gen-san has never appeared before.

462
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I can't make it like Gen-san.

463
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's what you said.

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Marukome.

465
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is a good match.

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll talk to you.

467
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll see if Gen-san can make it.

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Gen-san and Marukome.

469
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's do that.

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
OK?

471
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Just in case.

472
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
OK.

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Let me introduce the letter.

474
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm a girl in the third year of junior high school.

475
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Have you ever felt embarrassed?

476
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Last summer, after the pool,

477
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I forgot to tighten my skirt.

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was in front of my favorite person.

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
A man with a strange face told me,

480
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You have a hole in your jacket.

481
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
As soon as I put my hand on my jacket,

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Two bags of napkins fell from my skirt pocket.

483
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've ever had an ultra high-class feeling.

484
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's embarrassing.

485
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's not good.

486
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's embarrassing.

487
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you ever feel embarrassed?

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Embarrassing.

489
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't think so.

490
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, I still don't know.

491
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
My mother.

492
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We went to Osaka Castle.

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That was the most embarrassing.

494
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
In Osaka Castle,

495
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's like an old ruins.

496
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There's something written on the ground like a stone.

497
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's like a good story.

498
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
My mother read it like this.

499
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is the person in my arms.

500
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This is the history of the castle.

501
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
There was a school trip.

502
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There were a lot of people around.

503
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
My mother read it.

504
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyone was looking at it.

505
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When my mother came to the middle,

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Her teeth fell off.

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Because it's an elephant.

508
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Kill it.

509
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Her teeth fell off.

510
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can't stand it anymore.

511
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What did your mother do at that time?

512
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Was she in a hurry?

513
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
No, no.

514
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Her teeth fell off.

515
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Because she doesn't have teeth.

516
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
She said,

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Her pink teeth fell off.

518
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's like a sticky condom.

519
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I watch it every week.

520
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You watch it.

521
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I have a question.

522
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When Hama-chan is on TV,

523
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
She always raises her bangs.

524
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Is it because Hama-chan likes it?

525
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Or is it because of the stylist?

526
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think it's cuter with bangs.

527
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What do you think, Mach-chan?

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It doesn't matter.

529
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hello.

530
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hello.

531
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes.

532
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So,

533
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're going to have an audition in July.

534
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you going?

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Why?

536
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If I'm going to attend, I'm going.

537
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The staff is going to attend.

538
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Right?

539
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's do that.

540
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Right?

541
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Right?

542
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm going.

544
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So, you're going to attend.

545
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't say that.

546
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Wait.

547
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The audition date is already set.

548
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't know what day it is in July.

549
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Is it 31?

550
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's already set.

551
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What day is it?

552
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Wednesday.

553
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't know what day it is on Wednesday.

554
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's a holiday.

555
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Wednesday is the most important day of the week.

556
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You have to work for a day.

557
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No, no, no.

558
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't want to be on a shitty program at midnight.

559
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's already set.

560
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You have to take a break from golf every other year.

561
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Don't think about it.

562
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We're going to have a celebration.

563
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We're going to ask for ideas.

564
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We'll ask for ideas for the celebration.

565
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's a holiday day.

566
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
