1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The next day

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Dad, I've become a director!

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Dad, I've become a director!

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Dad, I've become a director!

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What were you looking at?

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Excuse me.

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Dad, I've become a director!

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't get in my way.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You'll get in trouble if you do that.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not good for the company.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't talk about my plans.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't have the talent.

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Damn it.

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hang in there.

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Ms. Tsuka.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ms. Hamada and Mr. Matsumoto.

18
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Five seconds to go.

19
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, there's a weird guy.

20
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Five seconds to go.

21
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey, look at him.

22
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's up with him?

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you doing?

24
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mr. Otomo.

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you doing?

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mr. Otomo.

27
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's not it.

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I couldn't do anything to Otomo.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I just wanted to protect him.

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's my heart.

31
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Look at me.

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's no scar.

33
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is manliness.

34
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Otomo.

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're looking good, Otomo.

36
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Matsumoto, a producer doesn't just make a show.

37
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He makes people.

38
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know if that's true.

39
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Die, you guys.

40
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you guys?

41
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What are you guys?

42
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Nothing.

43
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Die, you guys.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You guys are all dead.

45
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're so stupid.

46
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I want to go home at the end.

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're both downtown.

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sometimes there's a stupid guy.

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Right in front of you.

50
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why are you guys all enemies?

51
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why are you guys so mean?

52
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not like that.

53
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When I look at you, I'm more manly.

54
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm more handsome.

55
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a matter of course.

56
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What?

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm saying I'm hungry.

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's a beef stew over here.

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There's no one who's going to eat it.

60
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wait a minute.

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wait a minute.

62
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're a beef stew.

63
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm a mozuku.

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm hungry.

65
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've been eating for three days.

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's the same thing.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't know if that's what you said.

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's really weird.

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think you're a big fan.

72
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If there's a fan from Fukuyama or Kimura Takuya, it's a big deal.

73
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's what I think.

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When I think about downtown, I need a male fan and a female fan.

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I'm the one who attracts female fans.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You don't have any female fans.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're not attractive.

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Wait a minute.

79
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What are the requirements of a man?

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For example, there's a sense of cleanliness.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What is it?

82
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's slippery.

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's not shark skin.

84
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you have a wife and children, it's slippery.

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not slippery.

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you have a wife and children, it's slippery.

87
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A boy like me.

88
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you stupid?

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's slippery.

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It doesn't matter.

91
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What is it?

92
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm in a trance.

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's take it easy.

94
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't have much time today, but I'll be back soon.

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You guys are just passing by.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We're going to come out, right?

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
To be honest, there are so many people in one place.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know if it's rude, but it stinks.

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't think it's right to say that.

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You guys.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's stimulating.

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't say that.

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a burden on our bodies.

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's going to sting.

105
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't have much time today.

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What is it?

107
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Did you have a new sister?

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're so popular.

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But it's amazing.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's hard to shake it off.

111
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I guess so.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you running away?

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm running away.

114
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When I walk down the street, I'm told to get married.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
When you walk down the street?

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When I stand up.

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm going to faint.

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He's running away.

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's amazing.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I feel like I'm going to get a shiver.

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
A shiver?

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's amazing.

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When I open my stomach, I feel like I'm going to get a cookie.

124
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What is it? Is it a snack?

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's money.

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The other day, I was going to use this as an opportunity.

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have to get married.

128
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I went to Belfare.

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't expect that.

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How was it?

131
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I thought it was going to be more amazing.

132
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But it wasn't that exciting.

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Really?

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I was doing it naturally.

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Like this.

136
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I wasn't doing it like this.

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But I was excited to some extent.

138
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You were excited.

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was doing it naturally.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't really need that.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But the staff told me to do it naturally.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I sat down.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I see.

145
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't talk when I'm sitting down.

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I really do.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I can't stop shivering.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You take someone who can't stop shivering home.

149
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't help it.

150
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think I have to do something.

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't help it.

152
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What do you mean you have to do something?

153
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have to do something.

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I have to make a girlfriend.

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why are you laughing?

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No, you're making me angry.

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why are you laughing?

158
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Your attitude is like, don't lie.

159
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't lie.

160
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's Yamada-san's style.

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's because you're half-laughing.

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not half-laughing.

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're not half-laughing.

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're half-laughing.

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No, no, no.

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm serious.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm serious.

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm serious.

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can say you're serious from the beginning.

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Right?

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm jealous of your life.

172
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're lying.

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Your wonderful home.

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've never seen it.

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Right?

176
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm really happy to see you happy.

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to have a home like that soon.

178
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
An ideal home.

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Right?

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right.

181
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A big mansion.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
A big mansion.

183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You live in a big house.

184
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, no.

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You live in a big house.

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, no, no.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's right.

188
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You say, hey.

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Who?

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hey.

192
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey.

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey.

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's a bit too much.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think I'll be longing for a home like that.

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Really.

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What do you think?

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
One or two things.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You have to ignore them.

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Getting married.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right?

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Right.

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't help it.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can't do that.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can't do that.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You can't do that.

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't.

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Even if you have a good personality.

209
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If you look closely, you have a little bit of a mimi-kuso.

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't want to marry a mimi-kuso.

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:06,800
I don't want such a

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why do you want a mimi-kuso?

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't think there's such a place.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is that so?

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm looking for it in the newspaper.

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Of course I'm looking for it.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you doing?

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You guys are so annoying.

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I haven't met anyone who does this kind of work.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's true.

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I want a woman who is about 40 years old.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's a lie.

223
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why?

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why?

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You should be younger than you are.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you doing?

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you want to hear it?

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Each person has a different sense of value.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please arrange the next three in the order that you shouldn't do it.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Furin.

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Medicine.

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Baishun.

235
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Now, Mr. Hamada.

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's medicine.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
As expected, I don't say Furin.

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I see.

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's medicine, isn't it?

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why is that bad?

241
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's a warning.

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If you do that, you'll break your body.

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In the sense that it will be useless.

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Baishun doesn't matter.

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It doesn't matter, but...

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I agree with that.

247
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If you don't want Baishun, then...

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It doesn't matter, but...

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But it's difficult to say how much Baishun you want.

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
My mother is Baishun.

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
She earns money from her father and eats rice.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And then she stabs him.

253
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sorry.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll ask you a question.

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What is the worst thing you do?

256
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Medicine.

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then?

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Baishun.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Please stop.

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You don't know anything.

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What do you mean?

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Is Furin okay?

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I can't say it's okay.

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you usually like that?

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's all bad, but I think Furin is the worst.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't think so.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Why didn't you get married until you were 31?

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because you couldn't get close to one person.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
On the contrary, you said you would never cheat on your wedding day.

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But you decided to get married after you had a belly.

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's not true.

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's hard to say that Furin is your partner.

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't cry.

274
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There is a shop near my house.

275
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's been a year since it was written that it was being used by Baishun.

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What's going on in the store?

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a bad joke.

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's just a joke.

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's a good joke.

280
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why are you so serious?

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
When I get home, I'll tell the three of them that Machan is amazing.

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is it different?

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's different.

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Unlike in the old days, it's very effective now.

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If it's a normal cockroach, it will die.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There is a king of cockroaches.

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Is there such a person?

288
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's like a cockroach in a cockroach.

289
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's like a man in a man.

290
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's right.

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How big is it?

292
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's three and a half meters.

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's not a cockroach.

294
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I've been holding it for about a year.

295
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Something's wrong with my head.

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You've never seen it, have you?

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What do you mean?

298
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The king of cockroaches.

299
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The king of cockroaches.

300
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is it?

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's why I'm telling you.

302
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Where?

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course, in the kitchen.

304
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When I went to the kitchen, the king of cockroaches said,

305
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What is it?

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What is it?

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's what the king of cockroaches said.

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's what he said.

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He told me to get some soy sauce.

310
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's what he said.

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The king of cockroaches gave it to me.

312
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Can you tell me the nickname of Mr. Matsumoto's Nanamagari Shochidai?

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want to tell you.

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I want to believe you.

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Of course.

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That was probably in 1947 or 1948.

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It started with the sun.

318
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Right?

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's the world of dramas.

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
When did you and Nanamagari Shochidai meet?

321
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is...

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're so noisy.

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't come to me all of a sudden.

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You're talking like it's normal.

325
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It was just a change of place.

326
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A change of place?

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Are you saying this is a drama?

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I didn't buy anything like that!

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This is Mr. Matsumoto!

330
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's fine, but...

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It was just a change of place.

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It was just a change of place.

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What did he say?

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What did he say?

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't want to say this.

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Mecha-boin!

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He's a man.

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He's a man.

339
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He was shaking a lot.

340
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Was he fat?

341
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know if he was fat.

342
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He said,

343
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He said,

344
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
To Mr. Yama.

345
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Mr. Yama, you're so light.

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Mr. Yama said,

347
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Huh?

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're...

349
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mecha-boin!

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Is that so?

351
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He said, Is that so?

352
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Then the boss came back right away.

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And he said,

354
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You're going to be Mecha-boin from today.

355
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The last one was terrible.

356
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The way he died.

357
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Did he die of fasting?

358
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Of course he did.

359
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Really?

360
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What kind of way did he die?

361
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He was a really bad guy.

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He was beaten up a lot.

363
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Mecha-boin!

364
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
By the five or six guys.

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He was beaten up!

366
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Ouch! Ouch!

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ouch! Ouch!

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was the only one who got to the place of the transaction.

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You infiltrated?

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I infiltrated.

371
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There was no time for everyone to wait.

372
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The transaction was about to end.

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He said, Wait!

374
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Mecha-boin!

375
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But he was like,

376
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What the hell!

377
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Aren't you a good father?

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Stop it!

379
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Ouch! Ouch!

380
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And then...

381
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why did you die?

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why did you die?

383
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why did you die?

384
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They...

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They don't even know how to act.

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
From now on...

387
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They're just playing dumb.

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Let's go to the next scene.

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Scene!

390
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I made you the director...

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Not to do such a stupid job.

392
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Leave it to me.

393
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It was too early for Otomo.

394
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Right?

395
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Cut!

396
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Cut!

397
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I've never seen such a bad guy.

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He was like, Oh!

399
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Cut!

400
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He was laughing.

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Sura-chan!

402
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Good job, Sura-chan.

403
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Thank you.

404
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's still NG, isn't it?

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
NG!

406
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I...

407
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I made you the director...

408
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Not to do such a stupid job.

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Leave it to me.

410
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It was too early for Otomo.

411
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What are you doing?

412
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What are you doing?

413
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What are you doing?

414
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm tired.

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What are you doing?

416
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Can you give me a break?

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't do this.

418
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sura-chan is doing it so well.

419
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's easy to stop him.

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's easy to stop him.

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Thank you.

422
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I made you the director...

423
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Not to do such a stupid job.

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Leave it to me.

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Thank you, everyone.
