1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alpha members

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, Good afternoon

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,400
It's such a longer interview

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's long, right?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,540
Yes, it is

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,640
For those who haven't felt like this for a while,

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,000
we have no live image ever

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
from the audience

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't have Caraway

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I see

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now everyone can respond to this

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Seriously?

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,320
This program is sponsored by the following sponsor

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey!

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I've told you before

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You should make a more comedic face.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you mean?

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do you know?

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What?

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When you come down, you're always like this.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're completely a chimp.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Smile a little more.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I can't make a face like that.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a huge difference from a T-shirt.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't know.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You look like you're going to kill me.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Smile a little more.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're lying.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's better to do it with a serious face.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I was doing it normally.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Did you take a hidden camera once?

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's amazing.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's Kimoto, there's Makise, and in the meantime...

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The AT guy says, please.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Did you go somewhere in the summer?

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't go.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You didn't go.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But you went to Okinawa, didn't you?

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okinawa is my work.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When you came to play.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I went to Okinawa at exactly the same time.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
To be honest, Okinawa wasn't very interesting this time.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's no good.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The day I arrived, I went in the day before.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was filming.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the car on the way home, Tajima was saying,

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, yes.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What's wrong?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He said, Masumoto-san, the hotel room is impossible.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you mean by impossible?

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He said, let's go home.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was able to get a hold of something.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I called him right away.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I said, I managed to get a hold of something.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He said, what is that?

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't understand.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't understand why the hotel was taken.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I said, is it going to be taken?

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But when I asked him, he said it was a good place.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Really?

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He said, I don't understand why the hotel was taken.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I wanted to look for it myself.

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Really?

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was so angry.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What's wrong with the hotel room being impossible?

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not like that.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
When I arrived, I thought it was strange.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When I arrived at the hotel, I arrived before noon.

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When I arrived, there was a middle-aged man there.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I thought, what is this?

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you filming?

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When I asked him at the front desk, he said something like, you're lucky today.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is a live broadcast at the hotel today.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We will broadcast the poolside live.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It may be broadcasted.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a good match.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's funny.

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your way of filming is funny.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I finally took a break and came to Okinawa to enjoy my private time.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But I didn't hear anything.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Did you use the poolside?

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I used the whole poolside.

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I went to my room.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I went to the bathroom.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I went to the bathroom.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I went to the bathroom.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I went to the balcony.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I looked at the balcony.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I thought, what should I do?

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's like it's starting now.

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I put on an apron.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I put on a cape.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's like a comedy.

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've never seen a comedy in Okinawa.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, no, no.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is hard.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There are three cameras.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can see the pool from anywhere.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The sun is bad there.

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I still want to watch a video in my room.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I brought a video.

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't bring a deck.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought it was at the hotel.

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Excuse me, do you have a video deck?

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He said, no.

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If it's a suite, I have one.

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can't say it like that.

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't say it like that.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If it's something like that,

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I thought, what should I do?

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There's an electrician over there.

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't think of anything.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Last year, I was able to use my cell phone.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But this year, it's like I'm out of town.

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have bad luck.

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's why it changed.

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It wasn't funny at all.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why wasn't it funny?

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A lot of things.

125
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The plane is noisy.

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't help it.

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why do you put a kid on a super seat?

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's fine.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't say bad things about a super seat.

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It doesn't matter where you are.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It doesn't matter if the kid is noisy.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When I got on the plane,

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was like,

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the kid is noisy again.

135
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ouch!

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I got pinched!

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
My mom is noisy, so I pinched her.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ouch!

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I got pinched!

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's funny.

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It doesn't matter.

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How many days did you stay?

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Two or three days.

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I stayed for three days.

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you don't stay for a week,

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you have to go back when you say,

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm finally leaving.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When you get used to it,

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
when you know what it's like,

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
you go back.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's not good.

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know why I went on a trip.

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The poop doesn't pollute the toilet.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm a guest.

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When you go on a trip,

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you poop in the toilet, right?

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know if it's everyone.

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's no one in the hotel to clean the poop.

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Everyone poops, right?

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't do it at all.

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't poop.

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Really?

164
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not Okinawa's fault, is it?

165
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's because you didn't go on a trip.

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not Okinawa's fault.

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My hair stinks.

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Everyone tells me,

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Heminchu! Heminchu!

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Have you ever heard of Yamatonchu?

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Have you ever heard of Yamatonchu?

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm really sick.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't care about that.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My mother called me.

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She said she saw it.

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She said she saw it.

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She said,

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your father is angry.

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why is he angry?

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not an alchoholist.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not poor.

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm a comedian.

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My mother said,

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What did you say?

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I thought it was funny.

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's our character.

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What did you do?

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What should I do?

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's something my father had.

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My father had a big explosion.

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Please show it.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You've been to all the entertainers' houses.

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You've been to all the entertainers' houses.

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I've been to all the entertainers' houses.

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Tell me about the house of Seinkamyu.

196
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you really want to know?

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I want to know where you live.

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
First, the apartment?

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
First, the apartment?

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
First, the apartment?

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, the apartment.

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Where do you live?

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Seinkamyu.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Really?

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It says Kamyu in the title.

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It says Kamyu.

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It says Tomita in the title.

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I wonder if you live together.

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I see.

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have a luggage.

211
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How big is the house?

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It wasn't that big.

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Really?

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's about 18 square meters.

216
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a little small.

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a little small.

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't think it's small.

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You live in a big house.

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
18 square meters is a big house.

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's not a big house.

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not that big.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Tell me about the house of 18 square meters.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Tell me about the house of 18 square meters.

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't want you to tell me.

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't want you to tell me.

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't want you to tell me.

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know if that's true.

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What does the house look like?

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There's a 30-square-meter living room.

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Really?

232
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's diagonal.

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's 30-square-meters.

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's physically impossible to move.

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's 30-square-meters like this.

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's just below.

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right.

238
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can't go up there.

239
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a tatami mat.

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The eyes of the tatami mat are horizontal.

241
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll do my best.

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
At first, the eyes were the same.

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's why I'm doing this.

244
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The same.

245
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I had to take the things out of the closet.

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I did this.

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I did this.

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm having fun.

249
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I'm not stupid.

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I can move the tatami mat like this.

252
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can go to the middle.

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But you can't move the tatami mat.

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But the living room is not like that.

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I said that.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You said that?

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

258
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I just said that.

259
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't really get it.

260
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't really get it either.

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I said that it's not like that at all.

262
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's enough.

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's enough.

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So there's a 30-square-meter window on the first floor.

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And what's on this side?

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There's only the living room, right?

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When you open the door.

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
At first, there's only the living room.

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So there's something on both sides, right?

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's nothing on both sides.

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There's nothing in the bathroom?

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
There's nothing.

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's on the top floor.

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What?

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's the same as the stairs?

277
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right.

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
On the top floor, there's a bath.

279
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think there were three baths.

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I said that it was just the bathroom.

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't really get it.

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't really get it.

283
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I said, it's not connected to the bathroom.

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I said, it's not connected to the bathroom.

285
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There are three bathrooms.

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The bedroom is spacious.

287
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The bedroom?

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There was a bedroom.

289
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
On the second floor?

290
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It was on the second floor.

291
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But I don't think it's taken that much, because it's a 18-inch building.

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I see.

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I should have used it from the beginning.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I should have made the living room 30 stories high.

295
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, it was just a dream for the staff.

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The living room of 30 stories.

297
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
With that 18-inch building, it wouldn't have been possible.

298
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, it wouldn't have been possible.

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's not a 30-story building.

300
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's what I thought.

301
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's what I thought, but there's a bit of Sein's personality in it.

302
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's like, I'll do it even if it's at an angle, that kind of Sein's way of thinking.

303
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's move on.

304
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

305
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who still hasn't broken the record of being in Koshien 6 times.

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What kind of habit does a so-called Koshien demon have that no one has seen before?

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ah, a demon.

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What kind of habit does he have?

309
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I saw it during the summer of Kouni.

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You saw it?

311
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I saw it during the summer of Kouni.

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ah, I see.

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
When I said, from now on.

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What did you say?

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Did you see it?

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
From now on, when I said, that thing.

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That thing?

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The entrance course.

319
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The entrance course.

320
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I see.

321
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

322
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Summer, summer, summer, summer, here, summer.

323
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I saw it.

325
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, yes, you saw it.

326
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes, yes.

327
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The two islands.

328
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That, right?

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, yes, the two islands.

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

331
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, I don't care about that.

332
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

333
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Go on.

334
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then.

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Where did you see it?

337
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I said I saw it.

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
As a 9 o'clock.

339
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ah, that's right.

340
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Koshien 6 times.

341
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

342
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, yes.

343
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And then, I saw it.

344
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes, yes.

345
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then, what do you call that?

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This.

347
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Stockings.

348
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Stockings.

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There are stockings that look like, are you serious?

350
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, yes.

351
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are those?

352
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Stockings.

353
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Just like that?

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You noticed that I wasn't wearing stockings?

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I noticed.

357
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You noticed?

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You noticed?

359
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes.

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're really stupid.

361
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Everyone was like, here's the representative of Hyogo Prefecture!

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They were doing that.

363
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Eh, you were called like that?

364
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes.

365
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The representative of Hyogo Prefecture, please come here!

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They said that.

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And I was lined up.

369
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going!

370
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

371
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's what I was doing.

372
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What's that?

373
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Ah, from the beginning.

374
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The opening.

375
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I was doing something.

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And then, I was like, you're not wearing this?

377
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ah!

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was like, ah!

379
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can't do this!

380
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

381
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Right?

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Because I didn't think I could do that much.

383
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ah, I could have done everything I thought I could.

384
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, well, well.

385
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because you're a rocker.

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Because you're a rocker.

387
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But, you know, on a sunny stage like this, I thought it was not good to have only one person

388
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
wearing that.

389
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So, I went to the rocker room.

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I went to the rocker room.

391
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes, yes.

392
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Alone.

393
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, yes.

394
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I went up to the end, and then, the monster of Koshien was there.

395
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What kind of situation was it?

396
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
When I lifted it up.

397
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was shocked.

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What kind of situation was it when you lifted it up?

399
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I was shocked.

400
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ah, I see.

401
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There must be a lot of that minotaur.

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It was that big?

403
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It was really really big.

404
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ah, really?

405
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Really?

406
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What were you doing?

407
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What were you doing on the floor?

408
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was drinking water.

409
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Like this.

410
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like this.

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
At first I was trying to drink it directly, but it was surprisingly hard to drink.

412
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I was trying to hide it, but if I took a sip, I could drink it.

413
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I was peeping through the window because it was summer.

414
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right. It was hot.

415
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I didn't care about the heat.

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was just drinking it.

417
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What kind of person are you?

418
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I know you're tall, but I don't know what you look like.

419
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's right. You don't know at all.

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You can't draw.

421
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I know you're tall.

422
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's right.

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What kind of person are you?

424
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm a boy.

425
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Really?

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's when I was in high school.

427
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's right.

428
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You know...

430
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Am I a bad person?

431
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm not a bad person, am I?

432
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Mr. Matsumoto, Yoshimoto Kitte's Pichu Pichu Gainer.

433
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes.

434
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why do you always have to live like a log?

435
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you have any tips on how to live like a log every day, please tell me.

436
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I see.

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That may be true.

438
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What makes you a log?

439
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, in the end...

440
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's the same for everything.

441
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I want to be a log.

442
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's why my car number is also a log.

443
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you mean by a log?

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a log, so it's a log, right?

445
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can't say that on TV, Matsumoto's number!

446
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can tell by looking at it. You can't read it as a log.

447
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Your cell phone is also a log.

448
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A log, a log, a log.

449
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How can I always be a log?

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You have to always keep a log in your heart.

451
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I keep a log in my heart.

452
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then what are your goals?

453
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you have a goal, someone you admire, someone you respect?

454
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, I don't.

455
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Please say that.

456
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It doesn't matter.

457
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It doesn't matter if it's Nagashima-san.

458
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It doesn't matter if it's Antonio Inoki, the hero you admire.

459
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It doesn't matter who it is.

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I also have a log in my heart.

461
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So in the future, the hero I admire will be a log.

462
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Even if it's a dream, it's a dream that can be chased by a log.

463
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's hard to say that it's a log.

464
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What is a log?

465
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Where is it?

466
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't know.

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
In the end, it's fresh.

468
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Freshness is very important.

469
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think so.

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What is your favorite food?

471
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What is your favorite fruit?

472
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know.

473
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know if you're listening.

474
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How many times have we done this together?

475
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not yesterday or today.

476
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If it was yesterday or today, I would know if you were listening.

477
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We've been doing this for 20 years.

478
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Sometimes I say one thing.

479
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What is your favorite fruit?

480
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Nothing.

481
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's such a delicious summer.

482
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's really delicious.

483
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's such a delicious summer.

484
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you leave it for a long time, it will rot someday.

485
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is the flow of time.

486
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The flow of time can heal people's hearts, but it can also rot.

487
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I think so.

488
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't speak clearly.

489
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Being fresh is very important.

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I think so.

491
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want you to understand this.

492
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I understand what you're saying.

493
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's why Hama-chan will be fresh from now on.

494
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's why I said it at the beginning.

495
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When I said, Hama-san, nice to meet you, he looked like this.

496
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You didn't look like that when you were in the first generation of the NAC.

497
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank you.

498
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's true.

499
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You were amazing.

500
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Thank you.

501
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
How many times did you say sorry?

503
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You don't say sorry now.

504
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You don't say sorry even if you step on people's feet.

505
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's not true.

506
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's why your freshness is peeling off.

507
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There's only this part left.

508
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's all peeled off.

509
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's not true.

510
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm surprised by your freshness.

511
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're swimming in the sea of freshness.

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I understand what you're saying.

513
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's true.

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's why you can't swim in the sea of freshness.

515
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can't swim, but I can't swim.

516
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I understand.

517
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's dangerous to get used to it.

518
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But if you think about it like that, it depends on the person's motivation.

519
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What?

520
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What?

521
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You can't swim in the sea of freshness.

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You can swim in the sea of freshness.

524
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Your way of swimming is fresh.

525
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Which way of swimming is fresh?

526
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Your way of swimming is like an old man's.

527
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You swim like a young man.

528
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Which way?

529
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You swim like a young man.

530
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What do you mean by a young man?

531
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You swim like Boku-chan.

532
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's what I'm saying.

533
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I understand.

534
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
When I see people in trouble, I can't help them.

535
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I ask Matsumoto, a man full of manliness.

536
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't like it when people make fun of me at school.

537
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't like it when people make fun of me at school.

538
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Please tell me how to avoid trouble.

539
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This is true.

540
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You often say this.

541
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Even if you are found cheating, the most important thing is not to admit it.

542
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I see.

543
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
For example, if your wife finds you walking with a woman, that's a friend.

544
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Even if you think it's stupid, you want her to be like that.

545
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I see.

546
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So you have to believe it this time.

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is the same with poop.

548
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You poop so much.

549
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't care.

550
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But this is the same for children.

551
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I see.

552
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't say your name.

553
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The name that fell on the toilet.

554
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The name that fell on the toilet until the end.

555
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You forgot it.

556
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's the thing.

557
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I never poop.

558
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Please say that.

559
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But you're told to lie.

560
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:06,000
For example, if you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at the toilet.

561
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But if you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

562
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

563
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's hard, but if you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

564
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:53,000
If you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

565
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

566
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

567
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

568
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,000
If you're told to go to the toilet, you just want to look at your pants.

569
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Okamoto Osaki-san, Osaki-san!
