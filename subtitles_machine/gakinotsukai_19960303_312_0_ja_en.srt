1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Tsukitsuki Tsuttsun Hachihenge!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, I'd like to explain something.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What is Tsuttsun?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, isn't Tsuttsun amazing right now?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Eh?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Right now, it's...

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is he the main character of this program?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, no, no, don't say that.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've done a lot of things, you know.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But in the end, isn't everyone outnumbered?

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I want to create new characters here again.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I want to create new characters here again.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think you've still failed.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's supposed to be interesting in my head.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's supposed to be interesting in my head.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You know, I heard that today's going to be really bad.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Also, everyone has been Hachihenge for the past 7 episodes.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Also, everyone has been Hachihenge for the past 7 episodes.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, everyone has been Hachihenge for the past 7 episodes.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Only this guy is Hachihenge.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This may be what some people think...

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But it's not.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's scary!

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Anzenpai!

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to do more than one.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's not what I meant.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't want you to misunderstand.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
For now, today's star is Tsuttsun.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is Tsuttsun.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Tsuttsun is the nickname of Tsuttsun.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He loves Noh Miyano onee-chan and Stewardess.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He was given the nickname of Pinocchio by Tsuttsun.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is the director of Gakunoki Type.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is this guy going to be the opening act?

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't need this today, do you?

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't think I need the money today.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I had to do my make-up here.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I went to the make-up room.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I had to do my make-up here.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I saw it.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you going to do?

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you going to do?

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm going to be the host of the show.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's the concept.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What kind of staff are you going to have?

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to be the host of the free talk show.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is not good.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've done it once before.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I've done it once before.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't like this.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is there a TV program you're going to appear on?

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to appear on TV.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What kind of TV program are you going to appear on?

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to appear on a TV show.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What kind of TV program are you going to appear on?

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to be the host of the show.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm going to be the host of the show.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to appear on a TV show.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please select Mr. Usamoto Matsumoto!

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't look good with senior actors.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you do it like this, the picture won't turn, right?

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
How is it?

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No!

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're not good at this!

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What are you talking about?

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I wonder if it's like this...

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's no more K-1, right?

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah...

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's like this...

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hmm...

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yamazaki, right?

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're not lying, are you?

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're not lying, are you?

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're not lying, are you?

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What should I do?

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to challenge myself with various things.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's Vero.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Huh?

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's wrong with Vero?

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Vero, are you hurt?

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go!

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go!

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Vero, come here!

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Vero, are you hurt?

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Excuse me.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What should we do with Yama-chan?

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well...

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
On my program,

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I invited a big guest.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I invited a big guest.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He used to be on a comedy show.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I watched his old V-app.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now he's on the same show.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Stay!

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Stay!

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey...

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's wrong?

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Excuse me...

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good morning.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good morning.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Good morning.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Good morning.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Good morning.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Taima-chan, let's go to the bar next time.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's go.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When? When?

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When you have time.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's the appointment?

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who is it?

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's Sugasa-san.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Is it Sugasa-san?

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I haven't been able to watch him for years.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I want to move.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please decide the room.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If it's a good room, I'll live there.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Really.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How much is the rent?

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
17-80,000 yen.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Where do you want to live?

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want to live in Hatsudai or Yoyogi-ue.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yoyogi-ue is expensive.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's expensive.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's expensive.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's expensive.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's expensive.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll go.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I see.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll go.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is the last one.

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What's wrong?

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There's nothing in it.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's just the right amount.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's just the right amount.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I thought it was a free pass.

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Me?

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I thought it was a free pass.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I thought it was a free pass.

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I thought it was a free pass.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I thought it was a free pass.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, no, no.

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's been a while.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's been a while.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's been a while.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What?

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm glad you're awake.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm glad you're awake.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm glad you're awake.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm glad you're awake.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I just like Gakuya.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I've been crying.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was still crying.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm really tired.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, you just woke up.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Very good.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You just woke up.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's the usual.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You weren't far away.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's right.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Jimmy bye Jimmy

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Jimmy bye Jimmy

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He kind of collapsed recently.

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was a little flustered.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You were a little flustered?

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That was a good move.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It was a good move.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Somehow...

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah?

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It was a promotion program for the Ministry of Education.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No, no, no.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, well, well.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It was good, it was good.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What a waste.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't think he's a human being.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't think there's anyone who can beat him.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In that field.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Of course, of course.

206
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Of course, of course.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There's no one who can beat him.

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Even before, the queen of SM.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
She was beaten up like this.

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
She was called the queen.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It hurts, it hurts.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Please stop, my lady.

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're not a lady, are you?

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry, my lady.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There's a difference between a lady and a queen.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There's a difference between a lady and a queen.

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's completely different.

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're the only one who's different.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No one...

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No one thinks that way.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think it's really bad.

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's something like that, right?

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In everyday life.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There is, but it's not something you can say now.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm not going to say it because it's embarrassing, but...

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You know, when you go to a department store.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you're on the escalator,

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's a broadcast called,

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The escalator is on a cyborg.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sure there's a cyborg on it.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't think it's that funny.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't think it's that funny.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's coming out, so I can't help it.

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There's a cyborg on it.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
A cyborg, a small cyborg.

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why is it a parent and a child?

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's a department store, so it's a parent and a child.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't know.

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, Jimmy can't win.

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Jimmy can't win.

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's going to go.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He's going to go.

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Where did you say you worked?

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wine factory.

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, wine factory.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know why it's a wine factory.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a waste.

251
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There are a lot of people who don't quit.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Who?

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Who?

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Who?

255
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Who doesn't quit?

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's me.

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's me.

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're so mean.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't put a bug in there.

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, no.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know if you're going to make it bigger.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm saying this because I want you to put a bug in your own eye.

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What?

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What?

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What?

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You want me to put a bug in my eye.

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What?

269
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What?

270
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want you to put a bug in my eye.

272
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I said I wanted you to put a bug in my eye.

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's take it off.

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What?

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why don't you take it off?

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The naked-on-naked fight.

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We don't have a fight, so I'm saying I want you to put a bug in my eye.

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's why.

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Jimmy.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Jimmy?

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Jimmy is telling you to go where it's a waste.

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Run.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Go where it's a waste.

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There are a lot of other people who can't quit.

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Who are you talking about?

287
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's not a big problem right now.

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, no, I just got caught.

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I really want to hear it.

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's just an example.

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
An example? It's just an example, right?

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's fine. It's totally fine.

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's just an example.

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ah, that's Mel Gibson.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So what I want to say is,

296
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Even though Jimmy is funny,

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That funny Jimmy can't quit.

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He can't quit.

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a waste.

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There are a lot of people who are not as funny as Jimmy.

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You!

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who is that? Who is that?

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm saying what you're saying right now.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm saying what you're saying right now.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who are you?

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know who you are.

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm asking who you are.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Who are you?

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There are a lot of people like that.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What is it?

311
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I've been in the defense lately.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If I become number one in the Cho-Japan show,

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's not it!

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're the one who's in the defense.

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Really?

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If I become number one,

317
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll be in the defense.

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I used to say that.

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There are a lot of shows that I hate.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What kind of show is this?

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Ah, damn it!

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What kind of show is this?

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The show I hate the most is...

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry to say this, but...

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry to say this, but...

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not funny at all.

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's strange.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Everyone laughs at you for saying that.

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think it's funny, but...

330
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you know that difficult joke?

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I wonder if you know it.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I know it, but...

333
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's enough.

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You said it, so I want to hear it.

335
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Jimmy, it's a waste.

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There are a lot of things like Jimmy's next.

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know if it came out.

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But in the end, you can't beat Jimmy.

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's amazing.

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's different.

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's different.

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Today is another good day.

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is good.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is a good picture.

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is a good picture.

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Mr. Matsumoto skydived without a parachute.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How did you feel at that time?

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I thought I was going to die.

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I didn't do it.

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Are you following me 24 hours a day?

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's what I was told.

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You don't know what you're doing on your day off.

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know that.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You can't say that I haven't skydived without a parachute.

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shut up!

357
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Be careful when you talk.

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Why can't you say that you haven't done it?

360
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't know that.

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You haven't done it.

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're fast.

363
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're fast.

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Pull me a little more.

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I was scared.

367
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Were you scared?

368
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was scared.

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You were scared to death.

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's right.

371
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why did you skydive without a parachute?

372
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
First of all, I wanted a hungry spirit.

373
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't think it's right to fly with a parachute.

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
For example, you're skydiving now.

375
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You're skydiving now, right?

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You can't do that without a parachute.

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You have to do it without a parachute.

378
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's not a parachute.

379
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't like it.

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't like to rely on things.

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But you can't enjoy it without things.

382
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Then you should quit.

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No, no.

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then you should quit.

385
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You should quit.

386
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You shouldn't rely on things like that.

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Didn't you stop me?

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I was stopped.

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I didn't listen to you.

390
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Who?

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Who?

392
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't you know?

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't have permission.

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't want to do it without a parachute.

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a suicide.

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I put it on and went up.

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Did you put it on?

398
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I took it off when I was about to get off.

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't need it.

400
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I see.

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I told you to go up.

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I thought you had a problem.

403
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I told you to go up.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was scared because I didn't have a parachute.

405
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
My legs hurt a little.

406
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You are a snob.

407
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A snob.

408
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's a snob.

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You are a snob.

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What do you call a child born between a half and a half?

411
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a quarter.

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A half and a pure child are a quarter, right?

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A half and a pure child are a quarter, right?

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is that right?

415
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
A half is...

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
For example, a half is a child born between Japanese and Americans.

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
For example, a half is a child born between Japanese and Americans.

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's one half in the 5, right?

419
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And there's another half here, right?

420
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What happens if this half and the other half get married and have children?

421
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's what it is.

422
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is my child.

423
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
All of them are my children!

424
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hey! Hey!

425
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What is it?

426
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What? Isn't that what it is?

427
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Half and...

428
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No, no, no.

429
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The Japanese.

430
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
For example, the Japanese get married and have children.

431
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, is that so?

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So what are the half and the other half?

433
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Ah, there's something.

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There was something.

435
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There's something, right?

436
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Right?

437
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hey, I'm closing my eyes, but you ignored me.

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There was something.

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No, there's about 4 of them.

440
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes.

441
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But from that point on, aren't you going to be a 3rd or a 4th grader?

442
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're not moving at all.

443
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I have a question for Sexy Voice's Wazumoto-san.

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Sexy Voice?

446
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes.

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
A woman's voice is sexy, but what kind of voice is sexy for a man?

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, when we're having sex, we're both sexy.

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's a clash between sexy and sexy.

450
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Ah, so when it's that kind of voice, it's already sexy?

451
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's sexy.

452
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Ah, is that so?

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's all sexy.

454
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So when it's that kind of voice, it's already sexy?

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, it's already sexy.

456
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sexy.

457
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Huh?

458
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's sexy.

459
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What's that?

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What's that?

461
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's normal.

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
A man is sexy, and a woman is sexy.

463
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
A woman's voice is sexy, that's for sure.

464
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes.

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Ah...

466
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Ah...

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Ah...

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Ah...

469
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Ah...

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Ah...

471
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ah...

472
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ah...

473
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ah...

474
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ah...

475
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Ah...

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Ah...

477
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Ah...

478
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Uh, but, well, even for me...

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I have my reasons.

480
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes.

481
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So, after all...

482
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Ah...

483
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ah...

484
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But you come over here!

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I haven't thought about the emotion at all.

486
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is too sexy.

487
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Wait a minute.

488
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No, no, please do it one more time.

489
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Ah...

490
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No...

491
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,020
Why do you say you don't like it?

492
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
You're the one who's doing it.

493
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
You're doing it while saying, I don't want to.

494
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
He's saying he doesn't want to too.

495
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Awasan is saying he doesn't want to too.

496
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
I don't want to.

497
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
It's fine if you don't want to.

498
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,020
This is sudden, but I'm really weak at facing the other way.

499
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,020
I have a question for the king of facing the other way in the entertainment world, Macchan.

500
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
How can I definitely win?

501
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
I've never lost at facing the other way.

502
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Really.

503
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

504
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Look over there.

505
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
What are you doing?

506
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

507
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Look over there.

508
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
Hey!

509
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
You're not going to move?

510
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
If I do that, I'll lose.

511
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,020
That's not it. Tell me a way to win properly.

512
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,020
It's a way to not lose.

513
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I'm asking if I can win.

514
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Oh, really? I understand.

515
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

516
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Look over there.

517
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

518
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

519
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

520
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Who's going to stop me?

521
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
Who's going to stop me?

522
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
I'm asking if I can teach you how to win.

523
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,020
There's a way to face the other way.

524
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Do you understand?

525
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
There are three ways to win.

526
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,020
If you lose suddenly, you lose.

527
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,020
If you face the other way, you lose.

528
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Right or left.

529
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Humans tend to have a heart condition.

530
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,020
So it's more likely to face the other way.

531
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,020
But I don't know if I'm facing the other way.

532
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
So the best way is to win.

533
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

534
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
You'll be in this state.

535
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
When you make a U-turn.

536
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
First of all, I'll take the lead.

537
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
And then look over there.

538
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,020
No, look over here!

539
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
The heart is more important.

540
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:13,020
