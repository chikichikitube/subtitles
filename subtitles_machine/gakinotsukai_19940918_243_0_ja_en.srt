1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm hungry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You know Tokyo Walker, right?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, yes.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm looking for a restaurant there.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, really?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh!

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
No one knows this place yet.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is it good?

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's really good.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Really?

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is the only restaurant I know.

14
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, that's good.

15
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's really good.

16
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello.

18
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello.

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's nice here, isn't it?

20
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, it is.

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The old man is nice, too.

22
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The old man is a stubborn old man.

23
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes.

24
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What should I do?

25
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want a pork cutlet set menu.

26
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And you?

27
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want a set menu.

28
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just fool around.

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

30
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I usually order a pork cutlet set menu.

31
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think it's better to fool around.

32
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I was fooling around.

33
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What?

34
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You were fooling around just now?

35
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, I was.

36
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's a set menu.

37
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's hard to understand.

39
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's hard to understand.

40
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want a pork cutlet set menu.

42
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes.

43
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I want to have a pork cutlet set menu.

44
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then I'll have a pork cutlet set menu.

45
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hum.

46
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hum.

47
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hum.

48
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You laughed, didn't you?

49
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll have pork cutlet set meal

50
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll have the same

51
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're so annoying

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Welcome

53
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you doing here?

54
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was watching Tokyo Walker

55
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You came here

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I heard you were coming

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Really?

58
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What should I do?

59
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Don't make fun of me

60
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll learn

61
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I can't make a set meal

62
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll have pork cutlet set meal

63
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is golden 4

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I see

65
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll have tempura set meal

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll have pork cutlet set meal

67
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're so slow

68
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll wait for you

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're so slow

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll wait for you

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're so slow

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was coming

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're too slow

75
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The entertainment industry is flourishing

76
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Two wild beasts are trying to kill each other

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop it

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jimmy Onishi is scared

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't hit me

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you doing?

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yamazaki Hosei is the fastest in the entertainment industry

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A fight without justice

83
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you like your seniors?

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you doing?

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why did you come here?

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sit down

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I want to see your seniors

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Stop it

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Stop it

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stop it

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Stop it

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stop it

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Stop it

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you want to destroy the restaurant?

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do whatever you want

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're too strong

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't talk to me like that

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're too strong

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You should ask Imada

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't talk to me like that

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you want to?

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you don't want to hit me, hit me somewhere else

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won because of my strength

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you for watching

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please subscribe to our channel

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you doing?

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you understand?

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's eat together

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you understand?

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There's no point in hitting each other

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm angry at you

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Eat

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Eat

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why are you so quiet?

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're good at eating after a fight

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What are you doing?

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you doing?

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop it

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What are you doing?

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you like your seniors?

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Stop it

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you doing?

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you like your seniors?

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Stop it

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They're tired

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Give me some water

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What are you doing?

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No way

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Stop it

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stop it

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Do it outside

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You don't understand

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do it outside

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm angry at you

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's sensitive to smell

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hit me

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hit me

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He came out

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hit me

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's sensitive to smell

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll run away

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yamazaki, catch him

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Do it inside

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why did you let him go?

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You should flush the toilet

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What?

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can't go to the toilet

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Flush it

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't flush the toilet?

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can't flush the toilet?

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What's wrong with you?

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You light a cigarette for me

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're the same

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You light it

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't light it

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You don't flush the toilet

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll tell you

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No one will notice if I don't flush the toilet

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No one will notice

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't know

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If I light a cigarette for you, you'll go

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why?

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How many cigarettes did I light?

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're doing that at home

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you light it at home, you'll get a cramp

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't say that like it's a joke

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You should flush the toilet

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's a reason why I don't flush the toilet

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What's the reason?

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll go back there

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Teritory

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can go back after you flush the toilet

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't flush the toilet

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You don't flush the toilet

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't flush the toilet

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't flush the toilet

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's not true

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You pooped a lot

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Did you see me pooping a lot?

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You pooped a lot

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's too much

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I thought it was a big dream

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It doesn't matter

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't care

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Listen to me

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm so angry

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
To whom?

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hakone's sculpture

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Listen to me

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you don't cut it, I'll flush it

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll talk here

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There was a story about me and two girls going to the museum

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I said I don't know

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I said I didn't go

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I read the article

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I didn't wear a hat or sunglasses

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I just walked around

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm a big star

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I said I'm a big star

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I said I'm a big star

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Can you do that?

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know what you're talking about

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know how you felt

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have many faces

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I just happened to be in that situation

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm angry

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I've been in that situation many times

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't have a photo

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't have a photo

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm nervous

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't have a photo

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You saw it, right?

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I thought so

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There are two Abecs in the forest

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I saw it too

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was surprised

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why are you so excited?

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not excited

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was surprised

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't care about the photo of Abec

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want to see it

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't have such a photo

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You don't have to say that

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When did you take it?

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm angry

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know that

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You don't have to say that

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm angry

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't care about the photo

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't have such a photo

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know about it

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't care about it

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't care about it

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't care about it

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I have a girlfriend next week

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't have a girlfriend

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you say that, I can't be popular

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You...

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Stop it

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not good at eating

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If there is a rumor, I will write it

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You are a small man

250
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If I say I'm going to go out, you don't have to go out

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That day, I was in front of the apartment

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was listening to a song

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But that day

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It was a Friday night

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I didn't have an alibi

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was listening to a song

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
My girlfriend was working in Ginza until 7 o'clock

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What?

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She was working in Ginza until 7 o'clock

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't try to hide it

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't try to hide it

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's go

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
7 o'clock at night

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's too extreme

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
At 7 o'clock at night, I was with a person who was working in Ginza

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We fell in love

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When I went to Hakone, what time was it?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Picasso was sleeping

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Right?

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's right

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There was an alibi

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I had a lot of things to say

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I thought that if I went to the apartment tomorrow, there would be a lot of people

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was going to say it

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But when I went out, no one was there

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was in the army

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I couldn't explain it

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you get married, you'll be sick

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you get married, you'll be friends

281
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm glad I was in the army

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm glad I was in the army

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You were just in the army

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was in the army

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's too bad

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't see it

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I heard it from someone

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There was a wide show

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There was a reporter who told me that I was wrong

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The reason why I was wrong was

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Anuma-chan wouldn't go to such a romantic place

292
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What's the reason?

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What's the reason?

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What's the reason?

295
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're talking

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm very romantic

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm romantic

298
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What's the reason?

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's the reason?

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you want to get on the planet?

301
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I want to die

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I want you to die soon

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I want you to die soon

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's a wide show

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I lost weight

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's a story that ended

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You can't change it

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's true

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is it over?

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't know if it's over

311
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But it ended before I got married

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not married

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why?

314
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't have money

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

316
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't have money to get married

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't have a partner

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What?

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When I talk like this

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They talk quietly

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm serious

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm serious

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm scared

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is there a bomb?

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Maybe here

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If I'm going to get married, can I say it as a kid?

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's up to you

329
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll say it as a kid and leave the mic

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Hello

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
By the way, are you afraid of being kissed by a woman?

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Or are you afraid of showing off?

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you wear a kiss mark recently?

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do I wear it?

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's not a long time ago

336
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
About 20 years ago

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
About 10 years ago

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I didn't wear it

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
At that time, a kiss mark was an expression of love

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't wear a kiss mark now

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I just wear it

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When?

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
A long time ago

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
A long time ago

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I wore a kiss mark

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was told a lot

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't know if it's a kiss mark

348
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't know if I was bitten by a crab

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's cool

350
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why do you wear a helmet when you go to school by bicycle?

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's because I follow a rock

352
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Are you stupid?

353
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why?

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Why?

355
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm the one who runs on the cliff

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You know

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There is a school road that follows a rock

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Is it helpful to wear a helmet?

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's the truth

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The answer is correct

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's because there are a lot of yakuza around here

362
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's a matter of mind

363
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
When I follow a rock, I wear a helmet

364
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I can't do that

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If I follow a rock, I'll die

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But it's more important to wear a helmet

367
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a matter of mind

368
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why don't you wear a helmet in the city?

369
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't have to follow a rock

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There are a lot of things in the city

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Like under the construction site

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I know that

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've been hit by a hammer

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
When I was in high school

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You didn't die?

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I didn't die

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The hammer hit me

378
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Really?

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What happened?

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm fine

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's not true

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You fell down

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I didn't fall down

384
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's not true

385
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's true

386
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I was talking to him

387
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We were talking about something

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He said it's dangerous

389
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The hammer hit me

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I thought it was a hammer

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're lying

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I thought it was a hammer

393
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I thought it was a hammer

394
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What are you talking about?

395
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What are you talking about?

396
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I was talking about something

397
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I was talking about something

398
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You're lying

399
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I thought it was a hammer

400
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Really?

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
A rock followed me

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
A rock?

403
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
A beast came out

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
A beast came out and I was wearing a helmet

405
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A beast came out and I was wearing a helmet

406
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I thought it was a helmet

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I was talking about something

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I thought it was a helmet

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I thought it was a helmet

410
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why would a beast look at a helmet and run away?

411
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't think so

412
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't think it's a weapon

413
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I can make tempura with a helmet

414
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's not a weapon

415
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a weapon

416
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why are you different?

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why are you different?

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's okay

419
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Don't say it

420
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I really didn't hate it

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Really?

422
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Let's end it here

423
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I really didn't hate it

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
One more

425
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What are you doing?

426
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What are you doing?

427
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why are you wearing a helmet when you go to a country school?

428
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's because

429
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There are times when a rock follows me

430
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's dangerous

431
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You're a rock

432
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Even if a rock follows you

433
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you wear a helmet

434
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You can't wear a helmet

435
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Even if a rock follows you

436
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You won't be saved with a helmet

437
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's for carrying

438
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
There are a lot of yakuza around here

439
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's the same as wearing sunglasses

440
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't know if a beast will come out

441
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What is a beast?

442
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's for carrying

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's for carrying

444
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What?

445
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
One more

446
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Why are you wearing a helmet when you go to a country school?
