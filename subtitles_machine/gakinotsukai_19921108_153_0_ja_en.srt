1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I can't do it because I'm a kid.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm happy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I can't do it because I'm a kid.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's the star?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a signing match!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When you see this, you think,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
what are they doing?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Who's the star?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a signing match.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The star appears?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The star appears.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The star appears.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is there a star other than us?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's introduce the star.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Please come out.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is a star.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is quite a star.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was a little excited a while ago.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is quite a narcissist.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Nar-chan is in it.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you have time, look in the mirror.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is also a star.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is also a star.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This person is the producer.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not the producer.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not the producer.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Harajuku

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Harajuku

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
First of all, Saito san.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Stand up.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why, stand up.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
It's quite small.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Will it be able to hear?

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I see.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
It's very good that you can hear it.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
It's very good that you can hear it.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
It's very good that you can hear it.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
It's very good that you can hear it.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh!

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
What does it mean?

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
It's so hard.

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
It's so hard.

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
It's so hard.

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I have a lot of signs.

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:04,400
I thought it was not funny at all, but when I looked down, it was much more intense than I imagined.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I came to see this star.

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Let's try to hit the Heipo.

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Look at me!

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
This Heipo is popular.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,400
This place is lonely.

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
There are too many people.

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Where is this place?

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
This is Yotsuya 3-chome.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Is this written as Marusho?

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Before Marusho, Heipo and Otomo...

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It is written as Shinjuku Shinshu in Otomo.

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I think this is a bit painful.

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
It is Harajuku Shinshu.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Yes, it is Harajuku Shinshu.

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
It is not Harajuku at all.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I thought it was Hinakamon.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I was told that this is a Heipo store.

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
What is Hatsurainichi?

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Hatsurainichi is the first Heipo store in the city.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I think this is a foreigner.

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I think this is a Hong Kong person.

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I thought it was written as Saen.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I thought it was written as Saen.

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I thought it was written as Saen.

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I thought it was written as Saen.

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,400
What is this?

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
What is this?

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Heipo first.

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
This is Heipo.

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
If there is one person, the Shinshu of the military,

77
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
it continues, right?

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Please do your best.

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
It continued.

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
When one person comes, everyone is embarrassed, even if they want it.

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,900
I see.

82
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,400
I don't want it.

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Oh!

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
It's lined up at Otomo-kun's place!

85
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Abe-kun here is a little...

86
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
What is this feeling?

87
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
This feeling.

88
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
This feeling.

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Oh, it's gone!

90
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Oh!

91
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Wakai Onna has gone!

92
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Wakai Onna has gone to Heipo's place!

93
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
What!

94
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Why?

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's like a set-up, it's like a set-up, you know!

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm used to it, and the conversation is also...

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
What's going on?

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Please move Otomo a little.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
He's a big friend to me, but...

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm lonely.

102
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
No, really, no...

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
It's so scary, you know.

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
He doesn't have any students.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
What's your name?

107
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm Heipou.

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Heipou?

109
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
What's your name?

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't know.

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Do you know this?

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Are you a high school student?

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Are you a high school student?

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm Heipou.

115
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
What's your name?

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm Heipou.

119
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm Heipou.

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Are you a high school student?

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Yes.

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
What's your name?

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm Odama.

124
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Are you a high school student?

125
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
What's your name?

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm Odama.

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,400
He is a high school student.

128
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
This old man is curious too.

129
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I wonder if this old man will cut it.

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
What are you doing in a place like this?

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
You don't need it?

132
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
John.

133
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
John from Katakana.

134
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Why Katakana?

135
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
What?

136
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
What?

137
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
There is a young man.

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
There is a young man.

139
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
A little.

140
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Let's go.

141
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
What is this?

142
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Do you know what an automobile is?

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I thought I saw something.

144
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't know.

145
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I don't know.

146
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
How many did you cut?

147
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
How many did you cut?

148
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Six or seven.

149
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
How many did you cut?

150
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
How many did you cut?

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Eight.

152
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Eight.

153
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
About eight.

154
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Eight.

155
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I want to know how to cut.

156
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Eight for men.

157
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Eight for women.

158
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Eight for women.

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
What is the sign?

160
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
How to do it.

161
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I put my face in front and sign.

162
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Heipo is not understood.

163
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
It's a sign.

164
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I wrote it myself and said,

165
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
If you think about it in that way,

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
This is Otomo's victory.

168
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Yes.

169
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Heipo lost.

170
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
What should I do for Otomo?

171
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Sign for Heipo.

172
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:53,400
This is Spongy. He is a human sensor.

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
First of all, you have to clean Hamada's car.

174
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
First of all, you have to wash your body.

175
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Come on!

176
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Get on!

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Come on!

178
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
If you come here, I'll pull you.

179
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Come on!

180
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
It's a new car.

181
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Please use a lot of water.

182
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Come on!

183
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Next time, let's go to your car.

184
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
That's right.

185
00:08:39,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm happy.

186
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Do you have Spongy?

187
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I don't have it.

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:12,400
You have to clean it up.

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
You shouldn't be so angry.

190
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
A lot of dolphins are coming.

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm getting drunk.

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm an alien.

193
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm wearing a tan.

194
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
It's really late today.

196
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
What time is it now?

197
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
It's 9 o'clock.

199
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,400
This is probably the slowest time since the musical started.

200
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm really sorry.

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
This guy is yesterday.

202
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
You are yesterday.

203
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
That's right.

204
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,400
This guy was shooting in Aoyama yesterday.

205
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Then the old man said,

206
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Where are you shooting?

207
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
He came by bicycle.

208
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,400
There are many people like Kyoko Kishida and Ojinga.

209
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Everyone apologized to me.

211
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
What are you doing?

212
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
What is this?

213
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
You are really short-tempered.

214
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
No, I'm not.

215
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
You are really in the way.

216
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
If you say that, we will apologize to you.

217
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Everyone was in the way.

218
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm not in the way.

219
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I passed by lightly.

220
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I said,

221
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Come on.

222
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
You said,

223
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Come on.

224
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
What are you doing?

225
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,400
After that, Kyoko Kishida came to me and said,

226
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Were you a bad guy?

227
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
No, I'm not.

228
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm not.

229
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I followed Kyoko Kishida.

230
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Are you stupid?

231
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
If I liked you, I would have followed you.

232
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You were sleeping.

233
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
You were sleeping next to Kyoko Kishida.

234
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I was angry.

235
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
If Kyoko Kishida was angry,

236
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
It would be a big deal.

237
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
So Kyoko Kishida said,

238
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Stop it.

239
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
You are a good person.

240
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I don't want to see that kind of thing.

241
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
What?

242
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I used to be with 30 Yakuza.

243
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
You are a bad guy.

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Yes.

245
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
After that.

246
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
No.

247
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,400
It's beautiful here.

248
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
What?

249
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
What are you doing?

250
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I don't want to see that kind of thing.

251
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
So let's stop it.

252
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I'm angry because I'm a talent.

253
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Is that so?

254
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
When I went to the convenience store the other day,

255
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I said,

256
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Don't you only go to EMPM?

257
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I don't care if you say that.

258
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
That statement is a lie.

259
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Why do I have to go to the convenience store?

260
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Why do I have to go to EMPM?

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I don't want to see that kind of thing.

262
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
You two are in line.

263
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
One is here.

264
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
If this is EMPM,

265
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I will go to EMPM.

266
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
You're making a declaration.

267
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Well.

268
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
It's a lot of things.

269
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't make a big deal out of it.

270
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
If you hit him,

271
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
The newspaper will come out.

272
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
You hit him, right?

273
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I don't know that.

274
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
That happened to me.

275
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I got angry with a loud voice.

276
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Let's follow it for the time being.

277
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
But if you keep saying that,

278
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm going to hit you.

279
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
That's the attitude.

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Don't say that.

281
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
When you got angry,

282
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I was here.

283
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I was talking to him.

284
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Why are you talking to him?

285
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Do you want to go to EMPM?

286
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Why?

287
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Why do you want to go to EMPM?

288
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm going to EMPM again.

290
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm going to EMPM.

291
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
You're stupid.

292
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I called him for about two hours yesterday.

293
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
You're lying.

294
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
You were shooting on Takeshita Street yesterday, right?

295
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
That's right.

296
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I was shooting.

297
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
It's a goods store.

298
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm running a goods store.

299
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
In Harajuku.

300
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Go there next time.

301
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
When I came to Harajuku yesterday,

302
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Did you enter Noripee House?

303
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm a fan.

304
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm not a fan.

305
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
The top of my store was Noripee House.

306
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I thought I'd take a look.

307
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
There's no one.

308
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
There were only three staff members.

309
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,400
It's because I was shooting downstairs.

310
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Why are you doing such a horror movie?

311
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Why are you so good today?

312
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Why didn't you come on Sunday?

313
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
It's because I left my goods.

314
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
No, no, no.

315
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm shooting downstairs.

316
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm shooting downstairs, and there's a lot of people.

317
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
There's a staircase next to it.

318
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
If you go up there, it's Noripee House.

319
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
If you shoot like that,

320
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
What are you going to do next?

321
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
After that, we went up.

322
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
There's a lot of people on my floor.

323
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
The audience is flowing.

324
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
If you come out a little bit,

325
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
There's Noripee goods.

326
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Why isn't there anyone?

327
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I just made a mistake with the staff and the audience.

328
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
No, no, no.

329
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
I couldn't get it properly.

330
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Noripee's trainer.

331
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll buy it and sell it right away.

332
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Why?

333
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I can't get it at the store.

334
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
I'll buy it right away.

335
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Don't say that.

336
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Noripee is good.

337
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
What are you doing?

338
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Noripee's...

339
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Go!

340
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
You're here.

341
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
When I followed Takumatsu,

342
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
You said a lot of things.

343
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
You've changed.

344
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I can't do anything, so I'll do it for you.

345
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
That's not good.

346
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Is that so?

347
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
You're tough.

348
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I followed that.

349
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I didn't do anything.

350
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Takumatsu.

351
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Noripee didn't do anything either.

352
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
What are you talking about?

353
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Don't say that.

354
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Stop peeping.

355
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You've been saying that all the time.

356
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm in trouble when I'm with you at work.

357
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
What are you going to do then?

358
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
If you say Kanapi.

359
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
If you say that, I'll hit you.

360
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
That's right.

361
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Oh, that's right.

362
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm going to block it tonight.

363
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I came to the show the other day.

364
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
And when I was with you,

365
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
You blocked it, didn't you?

366
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I blocked it.

367
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Kenya was like this.

368
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
This program is not a program with two episodes.

369
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,400
The big-necked Taisho and the good-for-nothing Taisho.

370
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
You're number one, aren't you?

371
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
You've got two episodes, haven't you?

372
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Isn't it a program that Kenya shot two episodes?

373
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
That's what he said.

374
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
No, it's not.

375
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Well, you're watching, aren't you?

376
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
That's what he said.

377
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
He's running away.

378
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
He's sleeping.

379
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
That's right.

380
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Everyone's angry.

381
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
I'm not angry.

382
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Kenya was smiling.

383
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Kenya doesn't know what's going on.

384
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm really sorry.

385
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
That's not what I meant.

386
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
What do you mean?

387
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I want you to laugh.

388
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I really wanted you to laugh.

389
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Kenya is like this.

390
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh, my God.

391
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I don't want you to laugh.

392
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
What is it?

393
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,400
If you said that, I wouldn't say that.

394
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I just said Kenya was smiling.

395
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I have something to tell you.

396
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Little by little, the showdown.

397
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
There's nothing to bet on right now, is there?

398
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
That's right.

399
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
If you stop betting and just get a penalty.

400
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Why?

401
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
What are you doing?

402
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Why can't I get a penalty?

403
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Don't say that.

404
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,400
That's because you said too much bad things about people.

405
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
You're the one who decided that.

406
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
What do you think about time?

407
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Kouhaku.

408
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
It's a story from before.

409
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Kouhaku is fine, but it hasn't been announced who's going to come out yet.

410
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
The members.

411
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
What are you going to do?

412
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,400
If you lose, you'll be buried with someone or someone else.

413
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
What's so sad about that?

414
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Kouhaku.

415
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,400
What happens after Kouhaku is over?

416
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:21,400
It's coming. It's coming. It's coming.

417
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Why can't I come out?

418
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
That means the one who loses will come out, right?

419
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Don't say that.

420
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
There's that thing about Tsumo.

421
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Shindeshi Kensa.

422
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I have to go there.

423
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
How tall are you?

424
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
It's already decided. I'm definitely going to come out.

425
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
No, that's why.

426
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Don't say that.

427
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm really in trouble.

428
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Don't say that.

429
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,400
How many centimeters do you have left? I don't have enough.

430
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,400
If you lose, you'll be buried with someone or someone else.

431
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm that.

432
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I don't really want to be a sumo wrestler.

433
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Where is this in Nagano Prefecture? Hijiri-yama?

434
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Yes.

435
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,400
I went to a training camp. It was very cold and I had a cold.

436
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
It's painful when your nose is clogged.

437
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Actually, there's a way to fix that.

438
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,400
If you put a rod around your nose, your nose will go through.

439
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
That's absolutely true.

440
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It stinks.

441
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
So it's around here, right?

442
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,400
It stinks.

443
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
If it's clogged here, you can sleep like this.

444
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
If it's clogged here, you can do this.

445
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,400
If it's clogged on the left, you can look this way.

446
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
No, if you do this, it will clog here.

447
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
If you sleep here, it will clog here again.

448
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
No, that's why.

449
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
If it's clogged here, look this way.

450
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
You can't do that until morning.

451
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I can't sleep while I'm doing that.

452
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
You can't sleep at all.

453
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
It's true.

454
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
You'll get sick.

455
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
No, I won't get sick.

456
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Only your nose is clogged.

457
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Here?

458
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
It's clogged here.

459
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
That's what I'm saying.

460
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
It's yesterday's problem.

461
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I don't care about this.

462
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Well, sometimes I look in the mirror.

463
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
This guy is crazy.

464
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
He's crazy.

465
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Hama-chan, please tell us how you felt when Akiko Wada took your lips.

466
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I've seen it.

467
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I'll leave it to Akiko.

468
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,400
She was doing push-ups on a live broadcast.

469
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
I was caught by that guy.

470
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I was like, what?

471
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
It stinks.

472
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
This hand that came out of nowhere.

473
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
It's like it's going to explode.

474
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
The hand of that guy.

475
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
It's like he's killing Oyama.

476
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
It's like he's going to die.

477
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
That guy.

478
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
But if that guy does it seriously,

479
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I can't resist it.

480
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I can't resist it.

481
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I can't resist it.

482
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I can't resist it.

483
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I can't resist it.

484
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
And the pants.

485
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I'll hold it down with my legs.

486
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I'll take it off.

487
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Wait!

488
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I can't resist it.

489
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
It's a little thin.

490
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
I can't resist it.

491
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
I took it off in one shot.

492
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I took it off in one shot.

493
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
It's like a brother's dog.

494
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
It's like a brother's dog.

495
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
It's dangerous.

496
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm wearing a hat.

497
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm wearing a hat.
