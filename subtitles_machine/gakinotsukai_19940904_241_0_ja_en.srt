1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Please come in.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Where are we?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, we are here to celebrate the birth of Hamada's second child.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is that so?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You are amazing. You don't do this kind of thing.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You are here?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is my living room.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I see.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Please enjoy.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There is a kojirane.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a private room.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a small room.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's a small room.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No one can enter.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is that so?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There is a kojirane.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a peeping room.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Madonna.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a peeping room.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The fee is 2,000 yen.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
First of all, I'll give you 2,000 yen.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll give you 2,000 yen.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll give it to the manager.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Here you are.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Here you are.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where is the squid?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is it okay to broadcast this kind of thing on TV?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The director was surprised.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He was surprised.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm looking forward to it.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Here you are.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are noisy.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What is this?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Number 3.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's go to number 3.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is that so?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is today's menu.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let me introduce it to you.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A blonde ecstasy.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't like it very much.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a stew.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can eat as much as you want.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is good.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wet lingerie.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A nurse's petal.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I see.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a stew.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't stand it anymore.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't need this.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't like stew.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please give me a bag.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is good.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is good.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I prepared only this today.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can choose what you like.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is that so?

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll see this first.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I haven't seen it much.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm looking forward to it.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is a blonde ecstasy.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is for you.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
For me?

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is for you.

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Only for me?

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's 3,000 yen.

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Again?

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's 3,000 yen.

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's 2,000 yen.

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No.

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's 3,000 yen.

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's 2,000 yen.

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The bell rang.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What should I do?

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Please enjoy it.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Idiot.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why do you have tissue?

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you very much.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's nothing.

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is that so?

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've been waiting for a while.

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is that so?

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've been waiting for a while.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But it's a little expensive.

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you kidding me?

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This costs 5,000 yen.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is...

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's 5,000 yen.

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you need this?

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It costs 9,000 yen.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you doing?

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you preparing it?

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I know that.

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's time to start.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Grandma.

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've seen this grandma.

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What is this grandma?

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a blonde ecstasy.

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you very much.

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's wonderful.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is that so?

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think it was very good.

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Which one do you recommend?

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you recommend?

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wet lingerie.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you very much.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wet lingerie.

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's already wet.

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's already wet.

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Please.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The customer who came the other day.

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He went home three times with wet lingerie.

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Is that so?

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's wonderful.

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's wonderful.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's 15,000 yen.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's starting.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's starting.

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Wet lingerie.

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's already wet.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you very much.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hey.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's not coming out.

135
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, the customer.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's time to cry.

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm done.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no, no.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm done.

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, no, no.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's wet lingerie.

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wet lingerie.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's wet lingerie.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How much is this?

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is about 6,000 yen.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's starting.

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Wet lingerie.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Attention, please.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Attention, please.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What do you think?

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Here you are.

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you very much.

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wait a minute.

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wait a minute.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is this the end?

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's not good.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Wet lingerie.

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's so wet.

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're wet.

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's so wet.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You've been wet three times.

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I love it.

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I love it.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A nurse's firework.

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What about a nurse's firework?

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I like it.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I like it.

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I like it.

169
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I like it.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I like it.

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What are you touching?

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll take 16,000 yen.

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Good luck.

174
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please be wet.

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to be wet, too.

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't be wet.

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A nurse's firework.

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a nurse's firework.

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Here you are.

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A nurse's firework.

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you very much.

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is...

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a waste of money.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Look at this.

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What?

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's a summer flower.

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is the last one.

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please give me a bag.

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is...

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can see your skin.

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Really?

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How much do you have?

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What?

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How much do you have?

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll give you 40,000 yen.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll give you 40,000 yen.

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What?

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you doing?

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

200
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Did you see Akko last week?

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The opening?

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes.

203
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Akko's trial.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It happened, didn't it?

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was there.

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was there that night.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
From Lusden.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
From Lusden.

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
From Akko.

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I just said from Akko.

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't understand it at all.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I thought it was from an old man.

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You didn't say his name.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I did, but I couldn't hear it because of the phone.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So I thought I'd ask Lusden.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I said hello.

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Thank you very much for today.

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was fun.

220
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you very much.

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hey, old man.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey, old man.

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What is this?

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a long message.

225
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Thank you very much.

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I like funny things.

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was fun.

228
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't think I can call you.

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll put the phone number.

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If it's bad, I'll call you again.

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I forgot.

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not good either.

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What is this old man?

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I really like you.

235
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can't say it.

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But I don't understand that voice.

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I like funny things, too.

238
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm a singer.

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Singer?

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What is this old man?

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I still don't understand.

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This man is really good at calling.

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm watching you.

244
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm watching you.

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You should change your cell phone number as soon as possible.

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll change it.

247
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey, old man.

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What is this?

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I changed my voice.

250
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I didn't have a bad voice.

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You were famous.

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was famous.

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm scared.

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm scared.

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I met a man on Fuji TV.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He was a man.

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was talking to him.

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I saw him.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I saw him.

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I found him.

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, really?

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm watching you.

263
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm watching you.

264
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've been watching you all the time.

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I didn't forget you.

266
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You should have said,

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm watching you.

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You shouldn't have said,

269
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm watching you.

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right.

271
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You shouldn't have said that.

272
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you know that?

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What was it?

274
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you know the fighting game in the United States?

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There's a video of it.

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's everything.

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's Kinteki Geri,

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Kamitsuki,

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Metsurushi.

280
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There's everything else.

281
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You said there's everything.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
There are three things.

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There are three things.

284
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why are you emphasizing the word?

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to cheat you.

286
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There are only three things.

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm going to use my body.

288
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There are only three things.

289
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't you think it's amazing?

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What happened to your hands?

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Of course I wear gloves.

292
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You don't wear gloves.

293
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There are people who wear gloves.

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What are you talking about?

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What are you talking about?

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's a karate.

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There are a lot of pigs and karate.

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
When the pig said,

299
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When the pig said,

300
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I said,

301
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I said,

302
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I said,

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I said,

304
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I said,

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I said,

306
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I said,

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I said,

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I said,

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I said,

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I said,

311
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I said,

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I said,

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I said.

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I said and hit himself,

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and,

316
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I said and hit himself,

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and,

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:18,840
and he was plant

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,000
and,

320
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and he was plant

321
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,100
and,

322
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,000
and he was plant

323
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,000
and he was plant

324
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and he was plant

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and,

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and then.

327
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What kind of sword is that?

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's a tsui-ken, isn't it?

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a katana.

330
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's like a pot.

331
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's like a turtle.

332
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's like a turtle.

333
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
From here...

334
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you have a turtle, you can't attack.

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right.

336
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When you do it in Japan, you have to come out.

337
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's right.

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I thought I wouldn't be able to come out.

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The people who just applauded...

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
...want to see the dead side of the comedians.

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They want to bend down from their noses.

342
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But, you know...

343
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I...

344
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I...

345
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I...

346
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But, you know...

347
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
As you can see,

348
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There are many kinds of karate,

349
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
kung fu, kickboxing...

350
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There are many kinds of karate, kung fu, kickboxing...

351
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But the strongest one is the one who digs up poop.

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But the strongest one is the one who digs up poop.

353
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If you dig up poop, you can win.

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You...

355
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What kind of karate is that?

356
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you dig up poop,

357
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
there's nothing you can do.

358
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, it's not like that.

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Even if you say,

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Even if you say,

361
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Even if you say,

362
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
even if you say,

363
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
you don't want to dig up it's ok.

364
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But if you were going to dig up a real one,

365
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
you would have to dig up it.

366
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If you were going to dig up it,

367
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you would have been holding onto something.

368
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But, you...

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
your wife will run away from you to do such a thing.

370
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Who?

371
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, you know...

372
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, you know...

373
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Even if will be told,

374
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
his wife will go home.

375
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Even if people come to get poop, they don't sell one or two.

376
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, no, no.

377
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There are so many.

378
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
At first, there are a lot of poop.

379
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They come like this.

380
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Nice to meet you.

381
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's like noodles.

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's like thin noodles.

383
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's not good.

384
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No, no, no.

385
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I thought I'd collect a lot of poop.

386
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What do you think he's doing today?

387
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He told me to go with him in the morning.

388
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
My car...

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's blue.

390
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's Takasu.

391
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Takasu, Takasu.

392
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you think he's doing?

393
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Look at this.

394
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's a little bit of acne here.

395
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's so small.

396
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't look good in anything.

397
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, Mitsuyoshi.

398
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why did you ask me to do it?

399
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm surprised.

400
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is that so?

401
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't step on the brake suddenly.

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Wait, wait.

403
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That was terrible.

404
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
When I went to the cafeteria, the old lady kept looking at my nose.

405
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
She didn't look at it.

406
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is that Karasaburo?

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's about what the old lady sees.

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's going on?

409
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There were a lot of people.

410
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's okay.

411
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's not bad.

412
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What is the effect of the second radio exercise?

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Konimoto?

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes.

415
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, yes.

416
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This.

417
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's not cool.

418
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What effect does this have?

419
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's like this.

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's like training the inner eye.

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What about this?

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You need to be more energetic.

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's not cool.

424
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
There were a lot of things.

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What about this?

426
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Like this?

427
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't know about this, but it's like this.

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Rather than going from here to there, it's better to go from here to there.

429
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It all has a meaning.

430
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know what this means.

431
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What is it?

432
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You can see it if you look at it.

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's like this.

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Right?

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's like this.

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't look like a man who exercises.

437
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you look at this, you can see it, right?

438
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No matter how you think about it, it's like this.

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You can meet someone you've never met before.

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can meet someone you've never met before.

441
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Why?

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No!

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's not good.

444
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's the opposite.

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's the opposite.

446
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's the opposite.

447
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Matsumoto-san, do you often say that the mole on the inside is colorful?

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Or do you say that the mole on the chest is not good?

449
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you say that?

450
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What kind of mole is good?

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
By the way, I have one on my waist.

452
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
First of all, there is a tearful mole here.

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's right.

454
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There is a tearful mole here.

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is that so?

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the mole around the mouth here is a tearful mole.

457
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And the mole on the neck is a tearful mole.

458
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wait a minute.

459
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Everyone knows that it's a tearful mole.

460
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's right.

461
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's a tearful mole.

462
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't know what it means.

463
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The mole on the neck is not good enough.

464
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, it's not.

465
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't go anywhere.

466
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The mole on the neck is always satisfied with the mole on the neck.

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are people around me who spit out nonsense.

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I have a hard time reacting to it every day.

469
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What is the best way to deal with it?

470
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's hard to spit out nonsense.

471
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's hard.

472
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it's the person above you.

473
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's okay if it's an old man who has nothing to do with it.

474
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Even if you say that, you can't help it when it comes to seniors.

475
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't help laughing.

476
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't help smiling.

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The easiest way to deal with it is to pull it out.

478
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Pull it out.

479
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And put your hand in it.

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not a burden at all.

481
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's 30,000 yen.

482
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When I'm talking to Mr. Tamori, Mr. Sanma is doing a good job.

483
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You can't help it.

484
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can't help laughing.

485
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I can't help laughing.

486
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is the easiest way.

487
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Mr. Sekine has been doing it recently.

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's easy to laugh at Nakamura Tamao.

489
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No matter what he says, I can't help laughing.

490
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's easy.

491
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can't help laughing.

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's not like me at all.

493
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm having trouble with my upper lip.

494
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
How can I fix my upper lip?

495
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You can't help laughing.

496
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm having trouble with my upper lip.

497
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I can't help laughing.

498
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't help laughing.

499
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I know.

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
When I went to see the Sultine Bank,

501
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I was a guest, but I was beaten up.

502
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was confused with a pilot.

503
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
My legs were shaking.

504
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I can't help laughing.

505
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I was nervous.

506
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's it.

507
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know how far I can go.

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
My face turns red.

509
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I turn red, too.

510
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

511
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Really.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know when I turn red.

513
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
When I turn red.

514
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's it.

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know when I turn red.

516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What are you reading?

517
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I always think,

518
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A word that's written under the car is

519
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Kuhaha.

520
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Moha.

521
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What does that mean?

522
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Where is it written?

523
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, no, at the corner of the lower eye.

524
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Around the corner.

525
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's written on the vehicle.

526
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Kuwa!

527
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And there are numbers.

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
3 letters or 4 letters.

529
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why is it written?

530
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That is...

531
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If you listen carefully, you'll understand.

532
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What did I listen to?

533
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Whose words did I listen to?

534
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's just written.

535
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
No, no, no.

536
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You're curious, aren't you?

537
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No, no, no.

538
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Kuwa!

539
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The train is a great thing.

540
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Like this.

541
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Gadan, gadan, gadan, gadan.

542
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Kuwa!

543
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Thank you for watching!
