00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikishiki! Proudly, we have a big surprise for you!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Is it a surprise?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, it's a surprise.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The story goes back to the players.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To put it simply,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Takogui Ikagui slipped.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As a punishment,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He was given a lesson from the god of comedy.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So he slipped.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, he slipped.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The Tanaka of Kokoriko, who is doing the Maesetsu of Masayuki Uchi, is the big one, right?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This one is a little stupid.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Really?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yamada-chan has a strange head.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's strange.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why is it strange?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Basically, this guy is also a fan.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who is the fan of this guy?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, I'm the same.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As a comedian, he is a fan of Okama.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a fan of Okama.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So he is a fan of Okama.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He is one of them.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, he is one of them.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, the yellow one is Endo.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He knows.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He knows.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He also cooperates a little.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The audience knows everything about him.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What do you mean?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Endo also has a strange head.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What do you mean?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He is a little weird.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, please join the program.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's amazing.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you think that popularity is?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have a feeling.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you see it?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, I saw it.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't see the tree.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The tree was in full swing.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was so strong.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It was like a gorilla.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It was like a gorilla.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I thought I couldn't go home.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm still alive.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm glad I saw it.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm glad I saw it.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's amazing.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't believe that.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's amazing.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's amazing.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What kind of program is this?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't believe it.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't believe it.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's amazing.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's really amazing.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come on.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is it?

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a little late.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're working.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know what to do.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It will be over soon.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait a minute.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry...

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Apologies.

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
It's almost...

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,380
So, do something.

76
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,180
Let's do it then.

77
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,680
What is it?

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Do something.

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,180
Do something.

80
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
Give me the video correction.

81
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240

83
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Skin color.

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
It's boring.

85
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,940

86
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,460
Right!

87
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,460

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,460
Just go home.

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,740

95
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740

107
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
I can't do this.

108
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,740
You're like the ideal version of Riku.

109
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
I saw the ideal version of Riku.

110
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
No way.

111
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
When you were coming out, I thought you were going to stab me.

112
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
You thought you were going to stab me?

113
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
I thought so.

114
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
I thought you were going to stab me?

115
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
I don't know.

116
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
How was it?

117
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Pretty...

118
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
His face was weird.

119
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
I thought he was going to stab me.

120
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
Did you notice?

121
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
When I was talking,

122
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,740
I thought you were looking at me.

123
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Were you looking at me?

124
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
I was looking at you all the time.

125
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
I thought you were scary.

126
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
There were other customers.

127
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
Are you okay?

128
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
There were other customers.

129
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
I was going to the toilet.

130
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,740
Did you go out?

131
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Yes, I did.

132
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
I was wondering what was going on.

133
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,740
That's not good.

134
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
That's not good.

135
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,740
You shouldn't make fun of others.

136
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
You shouldn't make fun of others.

137
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
I'm really scared.

138
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
I'm really nervous.

139
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
I shouldn't do that.

140
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm weak against accidents.

141
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Stop it!

142
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
I said stop it!

143
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Why did you hit me?

144
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
I'm dead!

145
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm dead!

146
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
I'm dead!

147
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
Cut!

148
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
That's not what I mean!

149
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Cut!

150
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,740
Okay!

151
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,740
You can't do that. You have to act.

152
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Do it.

153
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Cut! Cut!

154
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
The actor is waiting for you!

155
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
He's waiting for the next scene.

156
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Can you hurry up and do it?

157
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Tatsu.

158
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,740
If you don't die, I won't be able to get out.

159
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I won't die.

160
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
I won't die.

161
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
It's not a fight.

162
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Why are you crying?

163
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Don't cry!

164
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
It was really scary.

165
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
You were shaking so much.

166
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
I've never seen you shake so much.

167
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
It was really scary.

168
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,740
You were wearing socks.

169
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Why were you wearing socks?

170
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
It was really scary.

171
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
I was really scared.

172
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
I could see you all the time.

173
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,740
I couldn't say anything because I was scared.

174
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
I could see you.

175
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
It was the worst.

176
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
It was really scary.

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,740
I couldn't understand it at all.

178
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Your face when you came out.

179
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,740
I don't want to see it later.

180
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,740
It was really scary.

181
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:37,740
You looked like a small animal.

182
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Today was really hard.

183
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Thank you.

184
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,740
I'm sorry to make you feel uncomfortable.

185
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,740
My plate is broken.

186
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
Really?

187
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
Yes.

188
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
You can't walk.

189
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
What?

190
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,740
My plate is broken.

191
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
It's not broken.

192
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
What?

193
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
It's broken.

194
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
Are you okay?

195
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
It's broken.

196
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
It hurts.

197
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Are you stupid?

199
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
My plate is broken.

200
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
It's not broken.

201
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
I'll ask you something.

202
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Why are you quiet?

203
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
It's clear.

204
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
It's not broken.

205
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Why do you say it's broken?

206
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
You're weird.

207
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,740
You think it's broken.

208
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,740
You think it's broken because it hurts a little.

209
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,740
It hurts a little because it's broken.

210
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
It's never broken.

211
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,740
You suddenly say something bad to everyone.

212
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
It's not broken.

213
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
It's not something you should say as a professional.

214
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,740
I don't want you to think I'm weird.

215
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,740
It's weird.

216
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,740
I think you can do 96% of your usual strength.

217
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,740
That's enough.

218
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,740
If you say that, I'll...

219
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
What?

220
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,740
I'm talking about myself.

221
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
What?

222
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
I hit my ankle with my shin.

223
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,740
You said your plate hurts.

224
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,740
I thought it hurt because we were together.

225
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
I did it with patience.

226
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
My plate is broken.

227
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
I'm sure my plate is broken.

228
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,740
It's hard to tell if it's broken or not.

229
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
It's broken.

230
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I'm sure it's broken.

231
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,740
It's not broken.

232
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
But...

233
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
What?

234
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,740
It will be in the future.

235
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
It's broken.

236
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
I'm really sorry.

237
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
It's broken.

238
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,740
This is completely true.

239
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Our downtown shop seems to be on fire.

240
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
What's going on?

241
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
That's okay.

242
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Really?

243
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm selling a pencil case at a stationery store.

244
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:32,740
He posted a picture of me and said it looked like a match box.

245
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I said, can you sell it?

246
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
I said that.

247
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,740
I should stop selling this.

248
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
It's not selling well.

249
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,740
It's not selling well.

250
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
It's true.

251
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,740
I should stop selling this when I open a shop.

252
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,740
What are you talking about with that look?

253
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Stop it.

254
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Don't you want to open a shop?

255
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
What?

256
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
No snacks.

257
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Really?

258
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Well, I think I'll do it at a pet shop.

259
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Why?

260
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
Because I like animals.

261
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
That's mean.

262
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Oh, you're trying to give me a good impression again.

263
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
No, no, no.

264
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I like animals.

265
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Right?

266
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
You're a kind person.

267
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,740
Yeah, I like animals.

268
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Right?

269
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,740
I want to have a dog, but...

270
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
I want a dog that can fight.

271
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,740
You mean a big dog?

272
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,740
Yeah.

273
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,740
You don't have to obey me that much.

274
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,740
I want a dog that can sometimes fight.

275
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,740
About three wins and two losses.

276
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
That's a good match.

277
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
That's a good match.

278
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Isn't it?

279
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Something like that.

280
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
But what if you lose?

281
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Three wins and two losses is good, but...

282
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
What about those two losses?

283
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
What kind of situation are you in?

284
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,740
If you win, I win.

285
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Then it's over.

286
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
What kind of situation are you in?

287
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,740
What kind of situation is that two losses?

288
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Basically, it's a dead end.

289
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Because I'm a talent, I can't get my hands out.

290
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
You can't hit your face.

291
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
I can't hit my face.

292
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Basically...

293
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Do dogs do dead ends like this?

294
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Why do dogs use fists?

295
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,740
That's why...

296
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,740
It would be nice if there was a dog like this.

297
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Well, that's fine.

298
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
I don't think there is.

299
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Is that so?

300
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Why do you hate dogs?

301
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
You don't like them?

302
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
You're so mean.

303
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,740
But sometimes I bring a dog to the studio.

304
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Everyone loves dogs, so they always fight.

305
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,740
But you never fight.

306
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
No.

307
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
I always hold him like this.

308
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Really.

309
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I've never seen you do it.

310
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,740
You always do it like this.

311
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
That's not true.

312
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,740
You do it like this, and I do it like this.

313
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
That's a weird story.

314
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
But if you do it, I'll do it.

315
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
No way.

316
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
You're weird.

317
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I think you have a problem.

318
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
A problem?

319
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
Are you stupid?

320
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
I always held him when he was a chimpanzee.

321
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,740
What is a chimpanzee?

322
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,740
That's scary.

323
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,740
What is a chimpanzee?

324
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,740
I'm not that bad either.

325
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
I'm a chimpanzee.

326
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
There was a chimpanzee.

327
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Where was he?

328
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
There?

329
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
I don't know.

330
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,740
I told him to throw away the trash he ate, and he threw it away.

331
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,740
In the end, that's how you treat him.

332
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
He's cute.

333
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
He's weird.

334
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,740
What are you talking about?

335
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
I'm writing a letter.

336
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,740
It's not broken.

337
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,740
It's a famous story that Mach-chan used to wake up the princess's sleep with a kiss.

338
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,740
He became a model for Princess Shirayuki in the fairy tale.

339
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Why does Mach-chan sleep with a yellowtail every night?

340
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,740
I don't know.

341
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Why does he sleep with a yellowtail?

342
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,740
To put it simply, he's a rising king.

343
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,740
I'm a human being, but I don't like people who are low-minded.

344
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,740
I'm a rising king.

345
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm a rising king.

346
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
If you're a rising king, you're a rising king.

347
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
He sleeps with a yellowtail.

348
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,740
He sleeps with a yellowtail.

349
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,740
Everyone doesn't care about his rise.

350
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Does he sleep with a yellowtail?

351
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
That's right.

352
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
A rising king?

353
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,740
That doesn't sound like sashimi.

354
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Is it just one?

355
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
No, one.

356
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
One.

357
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Or two.

358
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
When did he have two?

359
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Two when he broke up with his girlfriend.

360
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
And three.

361
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,740
Why?

362
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
I can't stand it! It stinks!

363
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Stinks?

364
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
It stinks!

365
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
It stinks! It stinks!

366
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,740
Your kid, Nozawa, said the other day that he pooped in his underwear.

367
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
I can't stand it.

368
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
It's different from that smell.

369
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,740
He must have been surprised. He peed in his underwear and pooped.

370
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
He's a rooster, right?

371
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,740
There are still 4 or 5 of them.

372
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
There are still 4 or 5 of them.

373
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
There are still 4 or 5 of them.

374
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
I thought there were only 2 of them.

375
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
I was surprised.

376
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
It's not that kind of smell. It stinks.

377
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
It's not that kind of smell. It stinks.

378
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Can you tell me about Buri?

379
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
What is it?

380
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
About his birth.

381
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Really?

383
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
No, no, no.

384
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
Hamachi is in the middle.

385
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Hamachi becomes Buri.

386
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Really?

387
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
That's fine.

388
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
And below that is Kamasu.

389
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
What?

390
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
Please don't do that.

391
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
This is a rule.

392
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Kamasu, Hamachi, Buri.

393
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
Kamasu, Hamachi, Buri.

394
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Kamasu, Hamachi, Buri.

395
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
I'll go even further.

396
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
What? What do you mean?

397
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Teri.

398
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Buri teri.

399
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740
That's after you've been judged.

400
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
That's after you've been judged.

401
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
It's fine even if I've been judged.

402
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
How many years do you have?

403
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
After you've been judged,

404
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
whether you're Buri teri or not,

405
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
it doesn't matter.

406
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Is it over when you're alive?

407
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
It's not over.

408
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Please tell me that.

409
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
What's next when you're alive?

410
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Buri papa.

411
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,080
Buri papa.

412
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
Humans cry when we cry,

413
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
so why don't we cry?

414
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Men, what would you do if you crying rock?

415
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
That's a bad story.

416
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Since first grade in 4th year school,

417
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
everybody has praised me

418
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:14,620
that I

419
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
am weak in rock.

420
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Then, where is your weakness?

421
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,420
Well, I'm weak but the one is my neck.

422
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,720
As for ragdoll, the hardest part of ragdoll, the part you don't want to touch, is the back of your head.

423
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,020
The part you don't want to touch?

424
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,420
Of course. Of course.

425
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Because if you don't have that, it's normal.

426
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Normal?

427
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
It's really complex.

428
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
What's normal about that?

429
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,920
It's normal.

430
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,420
It's an ordinary animal, isn't it?

431
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
An animal?

432
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
It's really complex.

433
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Is that the case with you?

434
00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,920
Of course it is.

435
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,420
It's very complex.

436
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,420
There are some people who think it's nice, but that's a lie.

437
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Ragdoll people already know what it is, so don't say it.

438
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
That's what they think.

439
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
So that's where it goes on.

440
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
That's where it goes on.

441
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Are you going to cry?

442
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,920
I'm going to cry.

443
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Are you going to shed tears?

444
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,420
Yes.

445
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,420
First, when you're in love with a ragdoll...

446
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
What are you doing?

447
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Hey!

448
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Hey!

449
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,420
What are you going to do if I touch you?

450
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
What are you doing?

451
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
What are you doing?

452
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Ah, ah, ah.

453
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Do it again.

454
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Cross your arms and touch me like this.

455
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
You shouldn't do that.

456
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Why would you do that?

457
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
I really don't like it when you do that.

458
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Why would you do that with your right hand and your left hand?

459
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
I'm going to touch you.

460
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,420
What are you doing?

461
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,420
What are you doing?

462
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,920
Right?

463
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,420
Stop it.

464
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,420
What do you mean?

465
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
What do you mean?

466
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
That's what Ragdolls think.

467
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Ah, I think so.

468
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,420
They say, stop it, ten times is one tear.

469
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Ah, I see.

470
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
I understand what you're saying.

471
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
You really understand, right?

472
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
I understand.

473
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
So what's wrong?

474
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
Where should I start over?

475
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
It was good when you touched me first.

476
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
That's fine.

477
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
It's fine here too.

478
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,420
It was good, right?

479
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,420
I can do it too.

480
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
It's fine from here.

481
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
It's fine from here.

482
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,420
I felt like I was going to fall down in a huge crowd.

483
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
It's fine from here.

484
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
That was bad?

485
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Yes.

486
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
Ah, so after this...

487
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Wait a minute.

488
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Do it like this, like this, like this.

489
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,420
After this, stop and go down.

490
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Then...

491
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
Can I do it again?

492
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
What?

493
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
Can I do it again?

494
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I don't mind, but...

495
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
What do you think?

496
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
It's the second time.

497
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Ah, there's no more?

498
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Am I fired?

499
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Is Yoshimoto fired?

500
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,420
It's been seven years since you started.

501
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,420
I don't know what kind of face you should have when you go back to your family.

502
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Please tell me the most natural way.

503
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,420
I think the best way is to go home empty-handed.

504
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
Well, yeah.

505
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,420
So you open your mouth and say,

506
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Yeah, but...

507
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
What?

508
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
What?

509
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
What?

510
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,420
What are you talking about, Suzuki?

511
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
You say that, but...

512
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:48,420
I think the most natural way is to go home empty-handed.

513
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,420
It's been seven years since you started!

514
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,420
That's the kind of tension you should have.

515
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

516
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,420
You say that there are as many women as there are stars.

517
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
What kind of number of men are there?

518
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,420
Well, you know, there are a lot of jokes.

519
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,420
And there are a lot of laughs.

520
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,420
That's a good thing to say.

521
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,420
And there are a lot of meals.

522
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,420
That's not the end of it.

523
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
That's not the end of it.

524
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,420
It's not the end of it.

525
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,420
It's not the end of it.

526
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,420
They say there's love in the wind of a kiss.

527
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Only the number of tears is moving.

528
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,420
That's a good thing to say, isn't it?

529
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Well, that's fine.

530
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Well, if you're going to say that, there are a lot of men.

531
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,420
That's right!

532
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
There are a lot of men!

533
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,420
There are men in Japan!

534
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,420
So let's go get a picture here.

535
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Well, you can't decide that.

536
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,420
No, the example of a woman is not so much a star.

537
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
That's right.

538
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
That's a strange example.

539
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Oh, is it okay if it's beautiful?

540
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,420
It's beautiful, but it's not a man.

541
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
It's kind of like that.

542
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
It's okay if it's beautiful.

543
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
What's wrong with me?

544
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Isn't it okay for a woman to be a rainbow?

545
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,420
There's no rainbow.

546
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
It's okay if it's beautiful.

547
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

548
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,420
It's okay if it's beautiful.

549
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,420
It's okay if it's something like a number.

550
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
A number?

551
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
There are a lot of numbers.

552
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,420
A bowling ball.

553
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
A yellow bowling ball.

554
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,420
It's a bowling ball.

555
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
It's beautiful.

556
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
It's beautiful.

557
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
It's beautiful.

558
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Have you ever thought that a bowling ball is beautiful?

559
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
No, I haven't.

560
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,420
It's a ball. It's a beautiful ball.

561
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
But there are three holes.

562
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,420
That's right.

563
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
That's a shame.

564
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
What?

565
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
It's a shame.

566
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
What's a shame?

567
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
It's beautiful.

568
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
What?

569
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,420
If there weren't these three holes, I wouldn't be able to say anything.

570
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
That's a shame.

571
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
That's right.

572
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
But there are three holes.

573
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
There are three holes.

574
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
It's beautiful.

575
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
I see.

576
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,420
You'll never get used to it.

577
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Do you think that jeers me?

578
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
You'll never get used to it.

579
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
No, it's a shame!

580
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,420
It's beautiful!

581
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
That's a shame!

582
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
It's beautiful!

583
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
That's a shame!

584
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420

585

It's beautiful!

589

There are three holes.

590
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
It's beautiful.

591
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
With its regional meaning.

592
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Return?

593
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Return, yes.

594
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
It's beautiful!

It's beautiful.
