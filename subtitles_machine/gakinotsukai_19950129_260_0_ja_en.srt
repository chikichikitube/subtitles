1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I won the tournament and got 300,000 yen

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
2 hours of shocking live broadcast

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The national tournament

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Everyone is doing their best

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Buy what you like

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I see

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a poor guy

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You don't have much

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Buy what you like

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Because it sucks

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are laughing

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But I have a tip

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to have something you can have

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll ask you why you want this

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You may be rejected

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you drop it once, it will be returned

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll start now

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You have 15 minutes

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No way

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll tell you what's in the south

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll go to the south

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Only B1

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Only B1

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The winner is

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
B1

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go to the south

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
B1

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sugajyan is out

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll return this ball

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It may be Sugajyan again

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sugajyan is good

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Tell me what you want

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
B1

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
B1

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is it?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TV

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There should be a TV at home

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why do you want a TV?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's old

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a box

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's big

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is bigger

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't hold it

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's 135,000 yen

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Study more

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't need it

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's 135,000 yen

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
B1

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You should choose

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Otomo

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How many times do you want to go?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go to the 4th floor

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll go to the 1st floor

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you okay?

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
B1

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sugai

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's get closer

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
B1

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Stop it

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a matter of time

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This one

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
B1

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why did you choose the suit?

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to get married

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you sure?

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
B1

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You should go to your parents

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You were married

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you say so

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
B1

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't need it

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
B1

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the second time

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
B1

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Otomo

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Stop it

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
B1

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Otomo will be happy

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll go to the 1st floor

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who's next?

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
B1

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What should I do?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go to the 5th floor

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
B1

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you tired?

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I couldn't wait

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Wait

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why did you choose the suit?

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
B1

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Isn't this cool?

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why did you choose the watch?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
B1

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Wait

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why did you choose the watch?

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a watch for kids

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
B1

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What are you doing?

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
B1

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go to the 7th floor

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's go to the 7th floor

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No way

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
B1

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What do you want?

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want a carpet

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
B2

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you have B3?

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
B2 is fine

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Should I buy 5?

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
B3

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
B3

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
B3?

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
B3 is fine too

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
B3

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll buy you a carpet

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
B3

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
B3

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
B3

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
B3

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
B3

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
B3

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
B3

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can do this

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You should walk

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You should walk

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
B3

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
B3

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
B3

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
B3

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
B3

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
B3

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
B3

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you understand?

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Did you wear it?

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
B3

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
B3

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
B3

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
B3

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No way

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I want you to wear it

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Try next

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sorry

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What?

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It has nothing to do with you

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You are sweating

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Please

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What the hell is that?

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is that Akano?

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's enough. Let's move on to the next one.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Alright!

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on!

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tsuttsun.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You call this Tsuttsun?

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Six times.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Who's next? Tsuttsun?

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Where are you going?

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Six times.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Six times?

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hurry up!

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Umobuton?

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've never been in Umobuton.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because it's Gimboni.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't take this home.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But it looks light.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a five-point set.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Umobuton?

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It looks light.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't take this home.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I can't take this home.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I've never slept in Umobuton when I was a kid.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Umobuton, five-point set, 68,000 yen.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Kotaro.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Can one person take this home?

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It looks light.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is wrong.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The color is different.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've never slept in Umobuton when I was a kid.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I came up with a new game.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What kind of game?

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is for work or for school.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why do you do that for school?

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's for fun.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's very popular in America.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That kind of fun.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you going to say it?

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Say it.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't teach you for free.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know, there was a game like tag.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We can do it easily.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is that kind of game?

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It doesn't cost money at all.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's very popular.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Say it.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't teach you for free.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're going to do it right away?

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Teach me the new game.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't teach you that way.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It makes me feel bad.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
When you want to teach someone something,

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
you have to use a pinhole.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll stop you.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll stop you.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well,

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
sing a song.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What?

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Make a song with ad-libs.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The lyrics.

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's very popular in America.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's very popular in America.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's very popular in America.

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Are you guys having fun?

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you guys having fun?

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Three minutes later.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's coming.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's coming.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you really think so?

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You look like a fool.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You look like a fool.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You look like a fool.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You look like a fool.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You look like a fool.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why?

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why do you look like that?

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
May I?

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll go first.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll go first.

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I like you.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You have to sing

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the lyrics of

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I like you.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You have to sing the lyrics of

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I like you.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Go ahead.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I like you.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
From the day we met.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
From the day we met.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I like you.

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I like you.

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
From the day we met.

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
From the day we met.

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's okay.

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's okay.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Be more strict.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hit me.

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hit me.

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
From the beginning.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
From the beginning.

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's go.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Shrimp.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wait a minute.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
From the beginning.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
From the beginning.

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Forever.

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Forever.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Go, go.

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Forever.

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Go, go.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I like you.

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hit me.

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Forever.

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Go, go.

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I like you.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Forever.

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Go, go.

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I like you.

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Go, go.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you doing?

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing?

279
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is an Apache baseball.

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Go.

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Teach me from the beginning.

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You always forget the beginning.

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Forever.

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's right.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Forever.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Go, go.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I like you.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
At that time, she wears a uniform.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I wear a uniform, too.

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Forever.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Go, go.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Wait a minute. Is this funny?

293
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, it's very funny.

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What happens after all?

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you forget something, you lose.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Your father loses.

297
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll do it.

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If it's you, I'll do it.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a very good family.

300
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Even at night.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You.

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why?

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Is it because of that?

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I like you.

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My mother says so, too.

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's change the subject.

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're cool.

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're a man.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hey, it's like Fujiko Fujio F wrote it.

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're not a man.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
For example, if there's a girl like me in the car.

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If there's a girl like me in the car.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You're in the car and you're looking at her?

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're in the car and you're looking at her?

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I think she's a cute girl.

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll do it.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I like you.

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I like you.

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How do you get on?

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Can you break up so easily?

321
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you get off the car with a car?

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sometimes and sometimes not.

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's just that.

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The fashion of women is popular these days.

325
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Women are wearing these boots.

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Really?

327
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't like that.

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I like it when I'm wearing it.

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll give you a house.

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
My house is like this.

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's like a person's front door.

332
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Any woman can get cold.

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
When I go to the bathroom, I have to go through the front door.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
When I go through the front door, I look at her.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She's sleeping.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When I look at her, I pull her.

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Is it just me?

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Don't make a big deal out of it.

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sometimes it's like this.

340
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's not true.

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You should definitely stop being a girl.

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're wearing those boots.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm taking you home.

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What's the problem?

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll take you home.

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Your way of thinking is strange.

347
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What should I wear if I wear those boots?

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I can't help it if I have a ray gun.

349
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's definitely strange.

350
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There's a car that looks like a future car.

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What should I wear if I wear those boots?

352
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Full-body tights.

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't help it if I wear full-body tights.

354
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's the problem.

355
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's strange.

356
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There's a woman's short cut.

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There aren't any men who like short cuts.

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Look at her short hair.

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Poor thing.

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry, but that's how it is.

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why do you hate it?

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's a woman's short cut.

363
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's how it is.

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I see.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It looks good on you.

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you cut your hair short, it means you're a woman.

367
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you cut your hair short, it means you're taking care of your father.

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, no, no.

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It means you're doing the same thing.

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You have to stop it.

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There's no such thing as a short cut.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's be careful.

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What? Boots?

374
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Boots, boots.

375
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I see.

376
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Tell me what to do.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm hungry.

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why do you put a lid on the toilet?

379
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I put a lid on the toilet after I pooped.

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's why it stinks.

381
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But it's like this.

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's like a firefly.

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But it's only a firefly.

384
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There's no one who closes the lid.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll close it.

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's the principle of the lid.

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That means it stinks when you open the lid.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's not true.

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
After you pooped, the next person came in.

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hama-chan, it doesn't stink.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
As expected of Hama-chan.

392
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What do you mean?

393
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Nice batting.

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
When you open the lid, the real Hama-chan comes in.

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The real Hama-chan of the concert comes in.

396
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a long concert.

397
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
How do you poop at that time?

398
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What's the purpose?

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's go to the next one.

401
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Please tell me how to distinguish between a male and a female.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
How do you distinguish?

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
First of all, it's wrong to distinguish.

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm the only one.

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm the only one.

406
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Everyone knows.

407
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm the only one.

408
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm a female.

409
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I'm a female.

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No, it's a male.

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's between male and female.

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's wrong.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There's a female.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's between male and female.

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a joke.

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I got it.

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's say it properly.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't think it's a joke.

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, don't think that your parents will be happy forever.

420
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm wearing underwear.

422
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We don't live together.

423
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It suits you.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I should have worn more.

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I want to ask Bakuzan-sensei's best friend, Masumoto-san.

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Are you his best friend?

427
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
He said, Yokaichi, this is the only thing I have.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But at the end, he said, I have a demon soldier too.

429
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Isn't it a lie that he only has this?

430
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Please listen to me.

431
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, I'm just saying that I have a demon soldier too.

432
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is one of my life.

433
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Even though you are married,

434
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
when you first get married, you think, this is the only thing I have.

435
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
When you get married, you think, I have a demon soldier too.

436
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I see, I see.

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I understand that.

438
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That kind of man's stubbornness.

439
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't think there's anything I can do about it.

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Everyone is looking for a demon soldier somewhere.

441
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Walking around the town.

442
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Even me.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You are saying the best thing today.

444
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's true.

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
About this.

446
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes, yes.

447
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's why a woman has to try to become Yokaichi.

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Right?

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But you have to think about which is happier.

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's Yokaichi.

451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You said, this is the only thing I have.

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Even if you say Yokaichi is better,

453
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
there are people who dig up Yokaichi and go to a demon soldier.

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But that's when Yokaichi digs up Yokaichi and goes to a demon soldier.

455
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The demon soldier becomes Yokaichi.

456
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's right.

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That's a good thing.

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's good in the end.

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But Yokaichi will look for another demon soldier.

460
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It can't be helped.

461
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's why a woman wants to become Yokaichi.

462
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I want to be Yokaichi.

463
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't want to be a demon soldier anymore.

464
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You don't want to be a demon soldier anymore.

465
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't want to.
