1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai, Tsukitsuki!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ameagari! Miyasako Shihengen!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What's up, Haruki?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're here!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What's up, Haruki?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Last time, my partner, Hotarohara-kun, completely slipped

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No, it was an accident

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm glad it was an accident, but to be honest, I don't remember what I did

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You were 4th place

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's true, but I don't remember what I did

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There were a lot of things

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Today, it's Aikata

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Aikata!

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Last time, Miyasako said, looking at Hotarohara-kun, that he was pathetic

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, he said that he was pathetic

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Today, I really did my best

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Today, I really did my best to get back at him

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're acting strange

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He looked like Yomi from Babylon 2

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Your bear is amazing!

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Did you sleep well?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, I was shaking and I didn't sleep at all

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are you doing?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's a lot of stuff

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is a high tension festival with a lot of people

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Will there be a lot of people?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Of course there will be

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There's a lot of live performances

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's a lot of live performances

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Personally, I want to do this

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't do that

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What happened to Tanaka's car?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll be there soon

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Really?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If I can drive a Ferrari

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You bought it?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I bought it

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a serve

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I like serve

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What should I do? Fuji Safari Park

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's really a lion

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What should I do? It's so cute

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What should I do? Fuji Safari Park

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What should I do? Fuji Safari Park

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That was good

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That was a bad start

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It was a bad start

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That was cowardly

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll never laugh again

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What will you do then?

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you going to record it?

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't think I'll come

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll just do it

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm hungry

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you for the food

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you for the food

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Did you do it?

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't know why

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't see the story

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is bad

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is bad

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is bad

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is really bad

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is really bad

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll never laugh

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:10,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:24,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:49,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Everybody put in

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Everybody put in

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Everybody put in

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Everybody put in

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Everybody put in

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Everybody put in

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Sato-imo

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Please don't put it directly on fire

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Takashima Homiri

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ah, it's the end of the pay

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's the end of the pay

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's the end of the pay

95
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why is it the end of the pay?

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's the end of the pay

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's the end

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's the end of the pay

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, this is the first one

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Count it

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I didn't say it

102
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I didn't say it

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Tanaka Mamota

104
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
26,000 yen

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's 3rd place

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
3rd place

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ohtomo lost

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's 3rd place

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This was good from the beginning

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Everybody put in

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's the end

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It was good

113
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How was it?

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I thought if I did it in the first try, I would be able to get rid of the tension

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What?

116
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Miyasako did it like this?

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
...

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yōkan Usai wa Nakayoshi da

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yoru wa Kuri Yōkan

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,640
Yōkan no danna wo sekurishan

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,440
Ate kono te te mameyo

125
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh, that's not good

126
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,040
Yōkan no danna

127
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,440
Yōkan no yome

128
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Dana wa ume yōka

129
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
That means he's sick, right?

130
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,140
I like you, I like you when I think about you

131
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,840
If you die, I'll die too

132
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,840
If I think about you, I'll think about you and then I'll die

133
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Ihi kanitama

134
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,440

137
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,040
Yōkan no yome

138
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Kyō mo kuri yōkan

139
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
I think I get it now

140
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Thank you

141
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Amazing

142
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
But this is only for today

143
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Well...

144
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
I told you before the show

145
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
It won't sell

146
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
It won't sell

147
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I thought it would sell

148
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
It's been a while since we talked

149
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
That's right

150
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
We haven't talked for a long time

151
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
We've been doing a lot of things

152
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
But we have a new challenge

153
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
What is it?

154
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
It's a macho plan

155
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
It's progressing step by step

156
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,040
My neck is going to get fat this summer

157
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
It's going to get thicker than the width of my face

158
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Your neck?

159
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
My neck

160
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
It's going to go up from here

161
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
It's going to be like raitan

162
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
What?

163
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
It's going to be like gold raitan

164
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I see

165
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
What are you doing today?

166
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I don't get it

168
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
It's going to be like that

169
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm going to try my best

170
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
You don't have to say it

171
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Just do it

172
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
It's been a while since I did it

173
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I don't do it often

174
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I can only do it 20 times

175
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
You can only do it 20 times?

176
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
I can only do it 20 times

177
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
I can't do it even once

178
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
What does that mean?

179
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
It's like the day before

180
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Muscle pain?

181
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
They say I can't do it anymore

182
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
I see

183
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
I can't do it anymore

184
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
I'll do it again

185
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm going to do this too

186
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
But I can't do it at home

187
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Why don't you go to the gym?

188
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
It's kind of cool

189
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Why?

190
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
It's like I'm desperate

191
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm going to do it

192
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Everyone is desperate

193
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,040
I don't want people to see me with black hair

194
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Black hair?

195
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
It's black hair

196
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
I see

197
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I think so

198
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I don't want people to see me with black hair

199
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I see

200
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I see

201
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
I want people to see my nipples

202
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
even if I'm facing forward

203
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
I want people to see my nipples

204
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,040
It's going to be around your illnesses

205
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
It's like a muscle

206
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Even if I do this, I feel like I have a nipple around here

207
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
That's just a muscle

208
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Near춰

209
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
I can't do that

210
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
I'm thinking of it

211
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
I do think I can do it next week

212
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
It's fast

213
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
I don't really fit

214
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I see

215
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
What's easier to stick to?

216
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Like a spirit?

217
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
I don't know that.

218
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Muscles.

219
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Ah, muscles.

220
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Ah, muscles.

221
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Why did you say it twice?

222
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I said it twice.

223
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
It's easier to stick to, right?

224
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,040
That's what my grandfather used to say.

225
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
A little stronger.

226
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,040
My family is a family of muscles.

227
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,040
This is not that effective.

228
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
It hurts a little.

229
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Ah, muscles.

230
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
It hurts a little.

231
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
It's in the body.

232
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
It's in the body.

233
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
I see.

234
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
It doesn't seem to say that much.

235
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Ah, right.

236
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
It seems to be from Osaka.

237
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
That it's in the body.

238
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
It's a muscle pain.

239
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
It hurts, right?

240
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
It's in the body.

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
It's in the body.

242
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
It's in the body.

243
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
M...

244
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
M...

245
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
It's M.

246
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
It's M.

247
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
It's M.

248
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
It's M.

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
It's M.

250
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
It's in the body.

251
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
It's in the body.

252
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
It seems to be related to the your body.

253
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Do you know?

254
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:38,040
I don't know if you're from Tokyo or not, but there are many types of Osaka dialects that have the same meaning.

255
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,040
There's only one standard word for it.

256
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,040
I think that vocabulary is the best.

257
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,040
They're not from Tokyo.

258
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Most of them are from the countryside.

259
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,040
You like that, don't you?

260
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,040
You like catching people and telling them about the countryside, don't you?

261
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Telling them about the countryside and telling them about the rules is weird.

262
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
What are you saying?

263
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Well, that's how it is.

264
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,040
The Golden Week was amazing, wasn't it?

265
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I was surrounded by Niigata and Iwate.

266
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
The cars?

267
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,040
That's how it was.

268
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I see.

269
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I recently found out what it was.

270
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
It was a firecracker.

271
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
The firecracker was amazing the other day.

272
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,040
He's an idiot.

273
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,040
If you turn on the engine, the firecracker will come out.

274
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Don't mess with me!

275
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't mess with me!

276
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
That's not how you turn it off.

277
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
It's not complete yet.

278
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
What do you mean?

279
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,040
If you pretend you're on a high-speed train and you can't get on it, it means you're on a high-speed train.

280
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,040
You're not getting on it!

281
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
You're on top of it!

282
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
That's what happens when you get off the high-speed train.

283
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,040
You're getting off!

284
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
That's not good.

285
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
It's good, but not good.

286
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
You're slow.

287
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
What do you mean?

288
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
You have to keep the speed limit.

289
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Because your grandmother can't handle it.

290
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Your grandmother is in the train.

291
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,040
When you reach 60km per hour, your grandmother is like,

292
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
She's like,

293
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm almost there!

294
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
She's already got it on her.

295
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
She's like,

296
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Your grandmother, your grandma, is like,

297
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,040
She's like,

298
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
What do you want me to do?

299
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm looking at you from above.

300
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,040
I don't know if you're on a high-speed train or not.

301
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,040
You should look at me from the side.

302
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm serious, so I'm looking at you from above.

303
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm going to fall from the side.

304
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Where are you from?

305
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Where are you from?

306
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I'm from Kumamon.

307
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I'm from Aobahanna.

308
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
You!

309
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,040
You have countless scars all over your body.

310
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,040
What is the first scar you have on your body?

311
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
How many scars do you have?

312
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Do you know how many stitches I have on my body?

313
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,040
If I add up all the stitches I have on my body,

314
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I can make two G-Pants.

315
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Basically, how many G-Pants do you have on your body?

316
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,040
I don't know.

317
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,040
But you don't have any scars on your body.

318
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
I'm a talent.

319
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I want to protect my face.

320
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:11,040
You want to protect your face and the woman you're in love with.

321
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Where are you?

322
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
My back is flat.

323
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Flat?

324
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Is your back the biggest?

325
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
I think my back was the biggest.

326
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
How wide is it?

327
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,040
I've gone wide.

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
What? All of this?

329
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
I've gone wide.

330
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I think I can put in dumplings.

331
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,040
I think I can put in dumplings.

332
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Why did you make a mistake?

334
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
It's your back.

335
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
It's definitely not dumplings.

336
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

337
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I'm just saying.

338
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Your back is flat.

339
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,040
And you said that you've gone wide.

340
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Why did your back get flat?

341
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,040
That was amazing.

342
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I was just saying.

343
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
You went wide.

344
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Let me explain.

345
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,040
It was really bad.

346
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,040
It was two times worse than Tokyo Dome.

347
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Over there, they had a cutter knife.

348
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,040
It was amazing when I noticed.

349
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,040
What do you mean you noticed?

350
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,040
I was there too.

351
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I said it.

352
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Why?

353
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
From here.

354
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I'll tell you an interesting story from here.

355
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
I work part-time at a rental video store.

356
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,040
I'm having a hard time paying attention to customers who don't return the money.

357
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Please tell me how to pay attention to customers.

358
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,040
I'll definitely return the money.

359
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Wait, wait, wait.

360
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
What do you think?

361
00:20:52,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Actually, it's best to tell him to return the money.

362
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,040
But he's probably weak-willed.

363
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I can't tell him.

364
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,040
So you should be able to tell him on the phone.

365
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
I see.

366
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Please tell him that.

367
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Then you go and return the money.

368
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Yes.

369
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Yes.

370
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Excuse me.

371
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Please be careful.

372
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
You're not returning the money.

373
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:34,040
If you want to tell him that, you have to do this.

374
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,040
I think he's laughing.

375
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,040
But the stroke is short.

376
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,040
You have to make it longer.

377
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I'll clean this up.

378
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Excuse me.

379
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Yes.

380
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,040
This is...

381
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Excuse me.

382
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Yes.

383
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Please return the money.

384
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Yes.

385
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,040
It's cold.

386
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Why didn't you tell me?

387
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,040
I didn't see the video.

388
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Why?

390
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,040
I forgot.

391
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:39,040
I forgot.

392
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I want to rewind that.

393
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Happy birthday to you.

394
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Happy birthday to you.

395
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Happy birthday to you.

396
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,040
When was the last time you were on this show?

397
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
The second time.

398
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
The second time you were on this show.

399
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
You have to tell him.

400
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
I see.

401
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Yamaguchi-san.

402
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Yamaguchi-san is going to say happy birthday in English.

403
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
In English.

404
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I see.

405
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
In English.

406
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Thank you.

407
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Everyone, please tilt your glass.

408
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Please hold the glass.

409
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Please say happy birthday in English.

410
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Please.

411
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Look.

412
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,040
This is...

413
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,040
