1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I have something to tell you.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It seems like...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's not working.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Did you meet someone special?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, I met someone special the other day.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, really?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's been a long time since I went to ***.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well...

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's like this.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't get excited when I meet the same people.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You don't know that?

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Who doesn't know that?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When I go to the same place, I meet the same people.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not interesting.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You went to a different place.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, I went to a different place.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is amazing.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You developed it.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There was a guy like this.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like him.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My mother does it.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well...

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How should I say it?

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
God's hand.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It looks good.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
God's finger.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It looks really good.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was wondering what kind of guy he was.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He was told that he was an old lady.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, he was an old lady.

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But he had a lot of technique.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He must have been greedy.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I was excited.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But he came.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A Colombian came.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I can't speak Japanese.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can't speak Japanese.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can't speak Japanese at all.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't communicate with them.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can't communicate with them at all.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Moreover, they bring a lot of tools.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They have a lot of tools.

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The tools for pleasure.

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The tools for pleasure.

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But they are useless.

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Colombians are useless.

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello.

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is my first time.

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know anything.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't do that.

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know what's going on.

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He came.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know what's going on.

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He told me that he came.

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He brought something like baby oil from his pocket.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Baby oil is sold in convenience stores.

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He brought only one in his pocket.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He put two on the bed.

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He brought baby oil and told me to go to bed.

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He said, I don't need this for now.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't need clothes.

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He took off everything.

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You should go home.

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why do you want me to do that?

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I went to bed.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I went to Colombia.

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Bang!

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I put baby oil on my chest.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not a persimmon.

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Bang!

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was surprised.

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Bang!

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I pushed it out.

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's not a persimmon.

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I said, I don't know what's going on.

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He put baby oil on my legs.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bang!

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I pushed it out.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It hurts!

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I said that for the first time.

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You should go home.

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Did you go to Itao?

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I went to Itao.

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A woman came to me.

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She was holding baby oil in her hand.

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What woman?

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A Japanese woman.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She was the mother of the child.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't play guitar.

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Has anything happened to you?

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Not much.

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well...

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I have insomnia.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Really?

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wow!

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You didn't tell me the whole story.

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You said you have insomnia.

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why?

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You said you have insomnia.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why?

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You said you have insomnia.

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why?

113
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know.

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't sleep well.

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm like an old man.

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm like this.

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why do you do that?

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're mean.

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're like this.

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have insomnia.

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know.

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why do you do that?

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You read too fast.

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm going to have a baby soon.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going to have a baby soon.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why do you always clean the pot at night?

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want to clean myself more and more.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to clean myself more and more.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to clean myself more and more.

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please tell me, Mr. Matsumoto.

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please tell me, Mr. Matsumoto.

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When you meet your friends in the morning, you say,

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Good morning.

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But when you meet your friends again in the afternoon,

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How do you say hello?

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You say, Hello.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You say, Hello.

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I understand that.

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll tell you one thing.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
For example, I said good morning.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I took a class in a different class.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I happened to be in the hallway for a break.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I said, Good morning.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why?

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's strange.

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't say that.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's strange.

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's strange.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's strange.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's strange.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where are you going?

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
To the science room.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's strange.

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't like that kind of meaningless conversation.

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm asking you where you're going.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wanted to tell you this before.

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
For example, there's downtown deluxe.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's a lot of people there.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't like talking to other celebrities.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's why you don't have any friends.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In the entertainment world.

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's a relationship.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't want to answer that kind of question.

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know anything about giants.

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's why you're always looking at people from the outside.

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's not good.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why do you look at me when I'm talking?

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm not looking at you like this.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not looking at you like this.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's not good.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The taxi driver says,

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I lost to a giant.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm not interested in baseball.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It doesn't matter if the giant loses.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm not interested in baseball.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You don't have to say that.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The air in the taxi is just like now.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's true.

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can only hear the sound of the air.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The air is bad.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
When I was a kid, my father had a reverse pattern.

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was in a taxi.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What happened to the driver's body today?

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He ignored me.

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's not good.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's not good.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Stop it!

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Grab it from behind.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It depends on the driver's back.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's not good.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
My father has a reverse pattern.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Matsumoto has a secret pocket on his body.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He has a man's seven tools.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is a man's seven tools?

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have a man's seven tools.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you have a secret pocket?

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
No, I don't have a secret pocket.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Really?

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where?

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't have a secret pocket.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You don't have a secret pocket?

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have a secret pocket.

204
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't have a secret pocket?

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You think you know me, don't you?

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You think you know me, don't you?

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You don't know 15% of me.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't know the other 85% of me.

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What's in it?

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
First of all, a condom.

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A man's seven tools.

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And a brush.

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A brush?

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A thin brush.

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like a brush.

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And...

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
A tissue.

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And a candle.

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A candle.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And...

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
A lotion.

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What kind of shop are you in?

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's that?

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's not a man's seven tools.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a business's seven tools.

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is that bad?

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's scary.

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can't put that much powder in there.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You'll get caught.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I got it.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If a bat throws a towel, why does it cling to it and fall with it?

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They live in telepathy.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They live in telepathy.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If a bat comes, it'll cling to it.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why?

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It has to be a bat.

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It'll cling to anything.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
In the end, bats look like that.

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They care about things.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So if you throw it, it's no good.

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you throw it, it's no good.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Maybe.

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's called a bat.

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They're kind.

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Just one bullet can reach them all.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But if you don't have one, scattered bats would come.

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Before as well,

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you don't have one, scattered bats would come.

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
before as well,

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If you don't have one, scattered bats would come.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In New York, there was a horse riding on the street.

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It was an officer.

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It 심ed like that as well.

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Even in that situation,

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the horse is walking on the asphalt.

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And at that moment,

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it's moving like this.

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
While walking,

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
it's not a round-shaped horse.

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's definitely a horse!

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't know about that.

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't think it's a horse.

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's say I'm a horse.

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is my first day,

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
so please take care of me.

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The asphalt is moving like this.

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm a horse, so I'm stupid.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's moving like this.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll do it.

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll do it until the second day.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
On the third day,

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll be like,

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
what?

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Everyone doesn't like it.

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's because,

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know if it's a horse or not.

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But I can't go to the horse race

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
on my own will.

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I have to endure it.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't want to do it.

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's a bother.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll keep on doing it.

284
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll be like,

285
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
this is really painful.

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm so angry,

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but I can't do it.

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The horse is on my back.

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The horse is on your back.

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll be like,

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll do it here.

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can't do it there.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If you touch me like that,

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
then, it's smart.

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's right.

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No matter what,

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll be in the back.

298
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll go.

299
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The horse is in my back.

300
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I can't endure it.

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been doing it for a long time, but it's getting slower and slower.

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This guy is strange.

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No, no, that's strange.

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You should remove it by yourself.

305
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If you can do it by yourself, you can put it on again.

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's it.

307
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's it.

308
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's all you can do.

309
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What?

310
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's a full-zone button.

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's strange.

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know.

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You have to think about it.

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't think you can do it.

315
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know if you're going to use exhaust gas.

316
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't think so.

317
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't think so.

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't think you can do it by yourself.

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't think you can do it at home.

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't think you can do it at home.

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's a bad thing.

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's why I'm telling you to stop.

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What are you talking about?

324
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's why I'm telling you.

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm going to take you.

326
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm going to take you.
