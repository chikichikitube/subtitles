1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Tonight's Gaki no Tsukai is decided by the two downtown guests who are currently active in the entertainment world while taking a questionnaire to the audience.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Otokomae Best 10 and Busaiku Best 10

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first time Gaki no Tsukai, Chikitiki

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tonight's Gaki no Tsukai is decided by the two downtown guests who are currently active in the entertainment world while taking a questionnaire to the audience.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The first time Gaki no Tsukai is decided by the two downtown guests who are currently active in the entertainment world while taking a questionnaire to the audience.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Otokomae Best 10 and Busaiku Best 10

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
First of all, Busaiku Best 10

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From the photos that Machan and Hama-chan entered,

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Chihara brothers, Riton Mizuno, 130R Hong Kong

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shimada Shinsuke in his 40s

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Pick up comedians who you think are Busaiku

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
From there, it was decided to decide the ranking of the best 10.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What do you think of this?

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is difficult.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But this is a little similar to the red Hidekazu.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's really a little.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, let's put it in.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Come on.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is the second place.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And then.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll think a little more!

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you desperate?

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, let's put it in.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So that's it.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why is it you?

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you doing?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't play.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I beg you.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It comes back.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well then, what should we do?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you want to write?

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The order. Let's decide the order.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's decide the order.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey, wait wait wait wait wait wait!

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's decide together!

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are you doing this to me?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey!

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey!

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sleepy.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm the best.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm the best.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ah, I see.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For me, no matter what I say,

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hong Kong is not loose.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The boy's face is rotten.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's compete with this and this.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's do that.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think it's this.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, let's listen.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
First, which one?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This one?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you think this is the first place, please press the switch.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you think this is the first place, please press the switch.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Huh?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you think Hong Kong is the first place, please press the switch.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Huh?

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes!

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
60?

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's because you guys have been telling Hong Kong that it's the last place.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Look at the real thing.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Look at the real thing.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How about this one?

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well...

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's listen to this one.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's listen to this one.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This one is called the ugly one.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know if it's Hong Kong or Hong Kong.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Second place.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think it's Mizuno.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's Mizuno.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What does that mean?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Does that mean Mizuno is higher?

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Huh?

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's listen to this one.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Look at this one. It looks exactly like you.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I think it's Mizuno.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Which one should I choose?

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is amazing.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You guys are so weak.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Next, Shinsuke, the only one in his 40s, asked for a survey.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There are surprisingly few people who think it's ugly.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
With 37 votes, he didn't make it to the top ranking.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Kimura Yuichi...

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's put him in the 10th place.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What?

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Please talk to me.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Please talk to me.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And then...

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Like this?

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's enough.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll put you in the 10th place.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know what you're thanking me for.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The 10th place said it's ugly.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The 10th place said it's ugly.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What do you think?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm not good at saying it's ugly.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's listen to Hamada.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Switch on!

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The one with the shoe laces wins, right?

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The one with the shoe laces wins, right?

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The one with the shoe laces wins, right?

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Bring me a first aid kit!

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A first aid kit!

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's decide on this one.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There will be some changes later.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's decide on the best one.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The best 10 is the same as the last time.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
First, from the photos of Matsu-chan and Hama-chan,

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Higashino Koji, Yamasaki, Ronbu, Gokuraku Kato,

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Nai Nai Yabe, Takusanju R Itao,

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Ameagari Kesshidai Miyasako, Kokoriko's Endo, and Tanaka.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They all picked the ones they thought were the best.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They will decide on the best 10.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who will be the best one among the actors?

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ah! I forgot the best one!

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's right!

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is it!

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is the best!

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's decide later.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's only one left?

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Really?

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Matsu-chan!

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is the last one.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's no photo.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a foreign one.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll put it in.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you very much.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's compete with this one.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
First, this one.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Amazing.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have to listen to this.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How do I listen to this?

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How do I listen to this?

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The shirt looks good on you.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The handwriting is not wrong.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you going to compete with this one?

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you going to go with this one?

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's obvious that you're going to compete with this one.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This one!

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Amazing.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a half-hearted number.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's applaud.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll move this one.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a half-hearted number.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Where is this one?

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's not good, right?

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You just have to move this one.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why do I get cold?

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If I had a bag like this, it would be the worst.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If you don't have it, don't clap until the end.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's it.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a little cold.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Matsumoto-san, your butt...

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't care.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't say that.

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't go up anyway.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't care.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I got it.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a half-hearted number.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You have to decide.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going to be busy.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's like this.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know what to do.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How is it?

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hama-chan, go up.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hama-chan, go up.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hama-chan, go up.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hama-chan, go up.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hama-chan, go up.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can hear Seron's voice.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Gokuraku and Downtown are the same.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Otokomae has to close it properly.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The partner has to close it properly.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is the Otokomae's best 10.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Donbu was chosen as a combination.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Matsumoto was a little stubborn, but he ranked in.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The best 10 is Shinsuke Shimada, a veteran of Rakuten Hoshino.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hamada ended up in the top 10.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't you feel uncomfortable that I'm here?

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You guys...

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You guys don't know that.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Really.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You have a terrible face.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know if I should say this.

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Here.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's normal.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like this.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The beard is like this.

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's amazing.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you don't shave three times a day, your beard will be black.

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's like a guy from the Shounen Bakurozoku.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The skin is round.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't shave this much.
