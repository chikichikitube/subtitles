1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first time, the child's use is not enough.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The 94th Sokesson, the natural botanist grand prize.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mr. Matsumoto, the judge.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, I'm the judge.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's the matter today?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, I don't know.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I don't really understand.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm the judge.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I think it's a very easy-to-understand project to decide the number one of this year's natural botanist grand prize.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let me introduce you to the three nominated people.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now, audience, please.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let me introduce you again.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First of all, this is Mr. Yamasaki Hosei.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And next to him is Mr. Koda Shin.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And last but not least, Tetsu-chan from Degas.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you for having me.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mr. Matsumoto, why are these people nominated?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, the schedule was open, wasn't it?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Today, I came to my friend, Mr. Hamayan and Mr. Matsumoto.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Tetsu-chan, you look very nervous.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, I'm not nervous.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I'm not nervous at all. I'm relaxed.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You just came out, but your expression is strange.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm relaxed.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, Mr. Matsumoto, let's get started.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
First of all, let's listen to the lecture.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Mr. Matsumoto, this is a natural skill.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, it's something that ordinary people like us can't understand.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's something we can't think of.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The first question is this.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Japan passing.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The phone is ringing.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The phone is fast.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go ahead.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, Japan passing.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are Japan passing.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How do you live in a dirty city?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How do you live in a dirty city?

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What do you want to do?

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How is it?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's okay.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mr. Hamayan is talking now.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's okay.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,180
I just saw a

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,000
biscuit.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you don't mind, you can eat it, but it will be gone in a second.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Next.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Can you do that?

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, I can do it with Japan passing.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So if Mr. Degawa can do it.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One, two, one, two.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Japan passing.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've been told that until now.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go for it.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The history of Japan is.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go for it.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Congratulations on your 1st anniversary.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The bad atmosphere has gone away.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's gone.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Yamasaki also got a biscuit on his 1st anniversary.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, Kouda.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Kouda, are you okay?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's Japan passing.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You gave me my life.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What kind of song is that?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You gave me my life.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here's the next question.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you okay?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
When I was in the 3rd grade, you were in the 1st grade.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You always take the lead.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go for it.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry for the pass.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry for the pass.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, no, go for it.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a great honor to give.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why are you in the 3rd grade?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm a classmate from downtown.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Mr. Negawa.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll change the momentum.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mr. Yamasaki came out.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Shall we go?

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When I was in the 3rd grade.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Talk to me.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're in the 1st grade, aren't you?

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What?

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't talk to me.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When I was in the 3rd grade.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go for it, Kouda.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When I was in the 3rd grade.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The next question is,

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry for the pass.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry for the pass.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go for it, Kouda.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you very much.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You can't just give the pass.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You have to give the pass back.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can give the pass back.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's right.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want you to aim for this.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Go for it, Kouda.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a hint.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a hint.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll pay you.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's all.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've never seen such a hint.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I have a warabi mochi for you.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a warabi mochi.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Kouda, it's 100 years old.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you very much.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yamasaki, please.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you very much.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Please don't be shy.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm a shiba inu.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What have you been doing lately?

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He's saying, I'm a shiba inu.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Go for it, Kouda.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's 4000 years old.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you very much.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm a shiba inu.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Next, Degawa.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, hey.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're Kato-chan, aren't you?

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Isn't that right?

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I know how you feel.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I know how you feel.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have no choice.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I have no choice.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll give you a hint.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll give you a hint.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll give you a hint.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll give you a hint.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Here I go.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's the meaning of this?

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's like this.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Kouda Shin.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's like this.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm in trouble.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it wrong?

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Here I go.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What's the meaning of this, Chikubi-chan?

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're still in trouble.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm in trouble, Chikubi-chan.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's U.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
U?

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
U!

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm in trouble.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
U...

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
U!

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
U...

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The flower road of the Ukiyo stage is both the front and the back.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The flower road of the Ukiyo stage is both the front and the back.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's the joke.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Please say it with Ha.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll do it like this.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The eye-contact is different.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's more cloudy than before.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ha-

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ha-tsunai-ki-

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ha-tsunai-ki-yossha-yossha

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ha-tsunai-ki-yossha-yossha

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ha-tsunai-ki-yossha-yossha

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Ha-tsunai-ki-yossha-yossha

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's good.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yamazaki-kun, let's go.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you going to do it again?

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
18 more laps.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There will be a problem.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yakult!

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You have to say it. What's the last one?

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's Yakult.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's Yakult.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Tonjiru.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's good.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's natural.

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Tonjiru.

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Tonjiru.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You said Tonjiru.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Tonjiru.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't do it.

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This may be popular.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll do it.

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Re-re-re-re-re Oshiba-da!

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Da.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's Da.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Are you going to do it again?

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you going to do it again?

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm going to do it.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going to do it.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you going to do it?

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you going to do it?

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't help it.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you get this wrong, your body will hurt.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My body hurts.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
My body hurts.

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know what to do.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's go.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The winner of the 1994 Tennenpoken is...

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Udo-kun from Kyain.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The winner of the 1994 Tennenpoken is...

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Matsumotochi.

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hello.

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This year is almost over.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's over.

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's amazing.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This program doesn't air at all.

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There's a little bit.

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's hard.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I heard.

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why do celebrities go abroad?

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Do they go to Hawaii?

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The mystery has been solved.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why?

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Actually, over there.

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's a little party for celebrities.

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's a delicious party.

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can't do it in Japan.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Celebrities meet in Hawaii and introduce each other.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They often become a couple there.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There's such a thing.

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's why I'm here.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's what I heard.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's why.

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Go away.

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's why.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I see.

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why are you all here?

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Is that true information?

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's true information.

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't believe it.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Is that so?

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When I heard that, I was relieved.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why are you relieved?

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why are you relieved?

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I had a question.

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Why?

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
There was a big question mark.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Go away.

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, that's right.

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why?

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, that's right.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I might be mistaken.

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's enough.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm very popular.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's right.

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But go away.

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But if you're on air,

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If I come as a New Year's entertainer, I'm a fool.

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm very cool.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm coming.

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When people see me on air,

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They can't see me.

263
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
My face turns red.

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sure there are tourists behind you.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you have a party?

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My face turns red all the time in Hawaii.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Who's doing the kanji?

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You mean this?

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's right.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's strange, isn't it?

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
A sports player and a talent entertainer.

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why do they hang out with each other?

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm an entertainer myself, so I can't help it.

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's that?

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There's an announcement for each entertainer.

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
At the end of the year,

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is there a paper with a date, place and time?

278
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
How is it?

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't care at all.

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't care at all.

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Tell me.

282
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There must be a dark route.

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There is.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm so angry.

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm so angry.

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm hated.

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There's a kanji.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And there's a guy who moves around.

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What should I do this year?

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This and this.

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Someone said, take them off.

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
downtown

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
downtown?

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you wear a mask, you'll be in trouble.

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sick.

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Are you saying it's my fault?

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's right.

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you have a disease?

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you have a disease?

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sure you do.

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you ask me how I got to know you,

302
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll tell you about my acquaintance.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's my acquaintance.

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's a party in Hawaii.

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Everyone wears a mask like this.

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's right.

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They're wearing glasses.

308
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Actresses and actors don't act in dramas.

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They do.

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's strange.

311
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's strange.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Right?

313
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Everyone does.

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But the actor's friend is a celebrity.

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Party?

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know if the actor's friend is a celebrity.

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

318
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't get it.

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They're dating.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Even though they don't know each other.

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But he's an actor.

322
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't know if there's a way to introduce him.

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't get it.

324
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why don't you get it?

325
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Are you stupid?

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That happens.

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Really?

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Right?

329
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Not just in Hawaii.

330
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I solved a mystery with this.

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want you to show your face.

332
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't tell you to participate.

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Wait a minute.

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He gave me a mask.

335
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't get it.

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's figure it out.

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But you don't get it.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't get it.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He gave me a mask.

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You don't get it even if he gave you a mask.

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Are you stupid?

342
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Seriously.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll look it up.

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll look it up.

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you very much.

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you very much for today.

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't get it.

348
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If it's like this,

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll use the route.

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm in Hawaii.

351
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But...

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll support you.

353
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't get it.

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yuta's part at the party.

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He's not in Hawaii.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But I don't know how many people will come.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't get it.

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll sleep.

359
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I thought this was a party.

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But when I arrived, I was so nervous.

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I thought I was going to die.

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's a real party.

363
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The other day,

364
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes.

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I sent you that.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Kudasanta.

367
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's...

368
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The AV mosaic is gone.

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, no, no.

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's Super 8 or something.

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You have the opportunity to make the AV disappear.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What?

373
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I gave it back.

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why?

375
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because I couldn't see it.

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's a little thin.

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There's an area.

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Everyone, listen carefully and go home.

379
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's an area.

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You see the AV, right?

381
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There's something like this at the game center.

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I have to match it with the place I want to see.

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have to grab that lever.

384
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I want to grab a different lever.

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I see.

386
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You want to grab your own lever.

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's right.

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You want to grab a machine.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's right.

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can only do the same thing.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Right hand and left hand.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So if the lever is like this,

393
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can do this.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, really, really.

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can only move in parallel.

396
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's weird.

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't understand.

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And it doesn't look that clear.

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's why I said, let's stop.

400
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Stop? Who are you talking to?

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Who are you talking to?

402
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's peaceful.

403
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What are you talking about?

404
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Please put me on.

405
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What do you mean, please put me on?

406
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There are about three cushions behind the car.

407
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Please put me on.

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Three cushions.

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Three cushions.

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The one with Santa Claus.

411
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If I get it right, I'll send it to you.

412
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What are you talking about?

413
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You don't know that.

414
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm personally sending it to you.

415
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If I say something like this,

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If I say something like this,

417
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Please put me on.

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I sent it to you.

419
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Where did you put it?

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Showa Shell.

421
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Showa Shell.

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I put gas in the Showa Shell.

423
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Please put me on.

424
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I want a lie detector.

425
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It was sold somewhere.

426
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Really?

427
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I wonder how accurate it is.

428
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't think it's going to work.

429
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Nishin people give me a lot of things.

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If you say it.

431
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I have a sleeping bag for Robocop.

432
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I gave it to you.

433
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I have a sleeping bag for Yakisoba.

434
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yakisoba's toothbrush.

435
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Please put me on.

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I went to see boxing the other day.

437
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, that's right.

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Tatsuyoshi.

439
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes.

440
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
After that, I called him to my room.

441
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's amazing.

442
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
After it's over.

443
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Boxers haven't had a fight since then.

444
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's all over the place.

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My nose is broken.

446
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
My hands are broken.

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's been like this all the time.

448
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's amazing.

449
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You don't have anything.

450
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, I talk a lot.

451
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The couple is funny.

452
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The couple is funny.

453
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's been two hours since the world war ended.

454
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What are we going to do tomorrow?

455
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
My wife said,

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You have to clean my house.

457
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Do it for me.

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Unlike men, women charm men in two places, the face and the chest.

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Where do women get excited when they see men?

460
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What do you mean?

461
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't understand.

462
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What do you mean?

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
When a man looks at a woman, he looks at the face and the chest.

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Where do you look at a woman?

465
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Where do you judge?

466
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
First of all, you shouldn't talk.

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Really?

468
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You shouldn't talk to a beautiful woman.

469
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm the one who gets angry when I talk to a beautiful woman.

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you think you're beautiful?

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm beautiful, but...

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm a man of my word.

473
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What kind of man of your word is allowed?

474
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Rakugo is a man of his word.

475
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No, I...

476
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I went to work the other day.

477
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I really want to go out with a woman like that.

478
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I've been playing with you all the time.

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What?

480
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When you look at a woman, where do you look at first?

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If you look at her like this, you can't see her at all.

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Then I'll look at her face.

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, I'm talking about the face.

484
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't even look at a woman like that.

485
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Where do you look at?

486
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I look at the legs.

487
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where are the legs?

488
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
One centimeter square, right?

489
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
One centimeter square...

490
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Please check it out.

491
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's weird, too.

492
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Please check it out.

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What do you mean check it out?

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What do you mean check it out?

495
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You're talking about the legs...

496
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The calves.

497
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The calves.

498
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Are you looking at the calves right away?

499
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No, I can't do it unless my legs are beautiful.

500
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What?

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What?

502
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But I'm not as big as I always say.

503
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm not as big as I always say.

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, I'm not as big as I always say.

505
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm not as big as I always say.

506
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But you know, like in the AV.

507
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're fat, but you're big.

508
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's true.

509
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you're that fat, you're big, too.

510
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's funny.

511
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If you're that fat, you're big, too.

512
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's use the word again.

513
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If you're that fat, you're big, too.

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's funny.

515
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know, Max.

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Everyone knows Max.

517
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What do you think golf is?

518
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I think it's the beautiful soul that flies away.

519
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The soul that flies away.

520
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes, when you see the soul that flies away.

521
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's what I think.

522
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Mentally.

523
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Where is your max when you sleep with a girl?

524
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think it's the last one.

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The whole time?

526
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The whole time.

527
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The whole time.

528
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But it depends on the person.

529
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
There are people who don't do that.

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They're really elegant.

531
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
They don't kill bugs.

532
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
When I open my legs like that.

533
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's what I think.

534
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I don't really like to hear this from the audience.

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm having a lot of fun.
