1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
9th Gagi no Chikai Arai and Chiki Chiki's New Year's Celebration!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How many times do I have to do this?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've been doing this for a long time and I've received a lot of positive feedback.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So I'd like to do it again this year.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm Yonazaki Honsai.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And now, we have a special guest.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's just started.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The main producer, Mr. Kenji Sugawa.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I hope we can all get along this year and make a fun program.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Get along?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hope we can all get along this year and make a fun program.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's start with a toast.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good evening, everyone.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good evening.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You guys aren't in a good mood.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You should say, Good evening.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good evening, everyone.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good evening.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You should say, Good evening.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There are a lot of people here, but I heard that you know us.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Raise your hand.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's funny.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Raise your hand if you've never seen us before.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Which one?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yonazaki-san, is this okay?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, really?

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, really?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, then.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's start.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I hope we can all get along this year and make a fun program.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good evening, everyone.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Good evening.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Cheers.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Good evening.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We hope we can all get along this year.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, then.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please take a look at our program.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please take a look at our program.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The next program is sponsored by the following sponsors.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The 9th Gaki no Tsukai New Year's Party.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They are drinking alcohol in a calm atmosphere as usual.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And they continue to talk about the party.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Thank you.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you, Jel, Hamada san.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Mr. Hamada give Mr. Hamada.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Well, really...

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
I can't.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We didn't get any drinks.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Really?

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mr. Hamada doesn't drink.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We already had our drinks.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're right.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is our drink.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You should drink it right now.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,320
You've had enough, then?

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We already drank enough.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Everything I've had will turn up.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Give it to me.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's for this training day of last week.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It seems perfect.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He didn't say anything.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He didn't say anything.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's the point.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you very much.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He was cool.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I wonder why.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I admire him.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He didn't even say anything.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He didn't say anything.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's the point.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's the point.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Say that two more times.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In the same way.

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you doing?

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mom.

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mom, I'll pour you some tea.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll pour you some tea.

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What are you doing?

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll drink it.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why did you put it in?

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I put it in.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
downtown.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
downtown.

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
downtown.

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
downtown.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
downtown.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Nakai.

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Nakai.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nakai.

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Your face is so red.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In the next episode of downtown's Gaki no Tsukaiya,

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Chigichigi.

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Wake up the UZO of comedy.

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Manzai Taigasse.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
From now on,

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
From now on,

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
From now on,

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
From now on,

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
From now on,

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
From now on,

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
From now on,

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
From now on,

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
From now on,

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
From now on,

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
From now on,

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
From now on,

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hamada.

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please stop.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That was a joke.

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That was a joke.

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't say it.

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's go!

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You still don't know?

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not yet.

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're not going to say it?

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No, not yet.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm still going to say it!

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're going to kill me!

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Stop it.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't say it.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Stop it.

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you say it like this, I'll be the one who gets hurt the most.

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hurry up and say it.

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't say it!

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So, out of the 20 members of the cast and crew,

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
5 teams will be chosen.

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What kind of new unit will be born?

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
First, I'll say the first number.

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Start!

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's hard to decide.

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Number 3!

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who is it?

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't want to say it!

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't want to say it!

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who is Nakamura-san's partner?

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Nakamura-san, please tell us.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't want to say it.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Nakamura will go first.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go first.

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't want to say it.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Number 5!

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who?

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Number 5!

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't want to say it.

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go for the second number.

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Number 2!

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Who is it?

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't want to say it.

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't want to say it.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't want to say it.

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't want to say it.

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't want to say it.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Who is Oonuma-san's partner?

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Number 4!

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't want to say it.

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is good.

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is good.

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't want to say it.

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's like an old comedy comedy.

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's go for the third number.

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The third number is...

182
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Number 6!

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Number 6!

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's the first number.

185
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's the second number.

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have a habit.

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You have a habit.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who is Komu's partner?

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Who is it?

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who is it?

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Number 16!

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Who is it?

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is hard.

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is hard.

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I haven't been with Komu since 1998.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll say it.

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Please don't do it.

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Number 17!

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Matsumoto-san!

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Matsumoto-san!

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Matsumoto-san!

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's Suzuki!

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's Matsumoto-san!

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's Suzuki!

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's Suzuki!

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's Suzuki's first time in a long time.

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was so into it.

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I thought I'd be in trouble.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Matsumoto-san, please choose your partner.

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's Suzuki.

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Number 8!

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who is it?

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's Kiri-san!

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's Kiri-san!

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's Kiri-san!

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's Kiri-san!

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's Kiri-san!

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's Suzuki!

219
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's Suzuki!

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's Suzuki!

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's Suzuki!

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's Suzuki!

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go.

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The last one is Komu.

225
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please!

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Number 9!

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Who is it?

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's Tsutsun!

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's Tsutsun!

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Please don't do it.

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Please don't do it.

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Who is it?

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's Takahashi-san!

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's Takahashi-san!

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's Takahashi-san!

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's Takahashi-san!

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll decide the topic from the first group.

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The topic decided by Yamazaki.

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
First, Nakamura and Yanaoka's long-distance relationship.

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hamada and Onuma's topic is a space trip to the future.

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And Kobayashi and Komurasaki's topic is a challenge to a homosexual topic.

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Matsumoto and Irie's topic is a birth drama.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And finally, Takasu and Tsutsumi's topic is a couple with a mask.

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a birth drama.

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I don't know which one is a joke.

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a joke.

247
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's a joke.

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a joke.

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The story of the combination that was chosen by the lottery has started.

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a serious battle with a professional will.

251
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What kind of comedy will it be?

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
First, the first group.

253
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hamada and Onuma's topic is a space trip to the future.

254
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's coming.

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's coming.

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's coming.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's coming.

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's coming.

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's coming.

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's coming.

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's coming.

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's coming.

263
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's coming.

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's go.

265
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
1998 is over.

266
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's over.

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's the 21st century.

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Two more years.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In the 4th century, a lot of things were invented.

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
For example, the internet.

271
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The internet is popular now, isn't it?

272
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can do anything while you're at home.

273
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is convenient.

274
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What's the secret?

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's right.

276
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For example, in the 21st century, you can use your computer at home.

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can use your computer to order food delivery.

278
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can do it with your phone.

279
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Also, in the 21st century, space travel.

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Space travel?

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I see.

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Space is getting closer and closer.

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Anyone can do it.

284
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Anyone can do it.

285
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Even if it's a little difficult, you can do it.

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You don't have any knowledge.

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's right.

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I already know everything.

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You know everything about space?

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I already have knowledge.

291
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Really?

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

293
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then, for the sake of the time when something happens, please tell me.

294
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll tell you today.

295
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll tell you specially.

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Thank you very much.

297
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

298
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, space.

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We've arrived.

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're fast.

301
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We've arrived at space.

302
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We've arrived.

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We've arrived.

304
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is space.

305
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is space.

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, it's still inside the ship.

307
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The destination is inside the ship.

308
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The destination is space.

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I see.

310
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Up to here, it's still okay.

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's right.

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
From here, it's space.

313
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And it's weightless.

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I see.

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why?

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why?

317
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why?

318
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why?

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why?

320
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why?

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why?

322
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I know, in spite of that, why?

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I know.

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What?

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know.

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's do it properly.

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We'll do it properly.

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We'll do it for real.

329
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's weightless.

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, please.

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
From here, it's weightless.

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
From here, it's weightless.

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I see.

335
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, it's not a place.

336
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, I see.

337
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't care!

338
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There's space, but we were wrong!

339
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know.

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I know.

341
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm counting on you.

342
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
From here, it's weightless.

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
From here, it's weightless.

344
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm already here.

345
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Do it properly!

346
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Do it properly!

347
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm already here!

348
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm already here!

349
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm already here!

350
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm already here!

351
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm here!

352
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm here!

353
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Where should I go?

354
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Where should I go?

355
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why did you do that?

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not a sea!

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Everyone, did you see?

358
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm not a sea!

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Do it properly!

360
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry!

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry!

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry!

363
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't say the same thing!

364
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's amazing!

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Take it off!

366
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you very much!

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That was good, wasn't it?

368
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That was good, wasn't it?

369
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Tomurasaki-kun and Kobayashi-san's

370
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Homo-sexual-manzai.

371
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Homo-sexual-manzai.

372
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm looking forward to what kind of manzai it is!

373
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's Seido-style!

374
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's Shinjuku, isn't it?

375
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In short,

376
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
it's a city of homosexuals.

377
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh?

378
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you okay?

379
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you okay?

380
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So,

381
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
today...

382
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's amazing!

383
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'd like to study about homosexuals.

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Good evening, everyone.

385
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Today, we have a homosexual course

386
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
for 1 million people.

387
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'd like to study about homosexuals

388
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
for 1 million people.

389
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's start with the first skit.

390
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The first skit is

391
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000

392
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to the audience.

393
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Let's get started.

394
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Sensei, go ahead.

395
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Welcome!

396
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you very much!

397
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He's shy!

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He's shy!

399
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He's shy!

400
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The second skit is

401
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000

Sensei, go ahead.

404
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you very much!

405
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He's shy!

406
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He's shy!

407
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He's shy!

408
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Thank you very much!

409
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He's shy!

410
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He's shy!

411
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's shy!

412
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The last skit is

413
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
the best welcome

414
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to the audience.

415
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sensei, go ahead.

416
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Thank you very much!

417
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He's shy!

418
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He's shy!

419
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He's shy!

420
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He's shy!

421
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He's shy!

422
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why is this funny?

423
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Taka's wife,

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Kamen couple.

425
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Welcome!

426
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We, Ganso,

427
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Michinoku,

428
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Eisho,

429
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We're singing.

430
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's right.

431
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We look normal,

432
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but there are

433
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
a lot of families

434
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
who look like they don't care,

435
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but when you look at them,

436
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
when you look at them,

437
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
there are a lot of families

438
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
who look like they don't care.

439
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Kamen couple.

440
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Kamen couple.

441
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's a skit.

443
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Ganso, Michinoku,

444
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Eisho,

445
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Kamen couple,

446
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
part one.

447
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm home.

448
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Welcome home.

449
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm tired.

450
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you want to take a bath?

451
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I want to eat.

452
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What is this?

453
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What is this?

454
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What is this?

455
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What is this?

456
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What is this?

457
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What is this?

458
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What is this?

459
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I didn't know that!

460
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Ganso, Michinoku, Eisho,

464
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Kamen couple, part two.

465
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm home.

466
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Welcome home.

467
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you want to take a bath?

468
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to eat.

469
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's get a divorce.

470
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's get a divorce.

471
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You look happy.

472
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Push the button.

473
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Push the button.

474
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Push the button.

475
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why are you saying that?

476
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Push the button.

477
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You don't get it.

478
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is this a divorce?

479
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't have the confidence.

480
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's hard.

481
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Nakamura and Yano are

482
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yano is in a long distance relationship!

483
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Hello!

484
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm Nakamura from FACT!

485
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm Yano from FACT!

486
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So cute!

487
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's eat together!

488
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The FACT!

489
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Recently...

490
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes?

491
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There are a lot of hot topics.

492
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What are they?

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Torimachi-kun and Izumi Iramori-san's love story.

494
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't think those two were dating.

495
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Those two are...

496
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What kind of drama is that?

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Beach Boys!

498
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you talking about?

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's Beach Boys!

500
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There are many kinds of love stories.

501
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But the most popular one is...

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Long distance love story.

503
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's a movie called Tokyo Station.

504
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's called Cinderella Express.

505
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's a movie called Tokyo Station.

506
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a movie called Tokyo Station.

507
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's a movie called Tokyo Station.

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to give him a good look.

509
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Finally, we're in Osaka.

510
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We're here.

511
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why are you here?

512
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's because we're far away.

513
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Scary.

514
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's scary.

515
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do your best.

516
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
See you next week.

517
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll be waiting for you.

518
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Kiss.

519
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Caramel for you.

520
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Caramel for you.

521
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why are you on it?

522
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You have to do this in the center.

523
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What are you doing?

524
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He was born in Matsumoto and Irie.

525
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hello.

526
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Hello.

527
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm Machan.

528
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm Irie.

529
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Together, we're Hammers.

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm going to hit you.

531
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you.

532
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Last year, there was a lot of news.

533
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What do you remember?

534
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The bank went bankrupt.

535
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The bank went bankrupt.

536
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The bank went bankrupt.

537
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What about me?

538
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The bank went bankrupt.

539
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's all about the bank.

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's not true.

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There was news that left an impression.

542
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There was.

543
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Tell me about it.

544
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Actually, I made a new hit.

545
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's private.

546
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's completely private.

547
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's not true.

548
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's expensive and cheap.

549
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's not true.

550
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There was news that a big star got married.

551
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
There was.

552
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Tell me about it.

553
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Sam's marriage.

554
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Tell me about it.

555
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Sam looks lonely.

556
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's right.

557
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He's lonely.

558
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Amuro is lonely, too.

559
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What surprised me was that he was pregnant.

560
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's right.

561
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He was singing while dancing.

562
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He was pregnant.

563
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I wonder if he's okay.

564
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's right.

565
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's a lie.

566
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was learning how to dance.

567
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

568
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I was learning how to dance.

569
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Who were you learning from?

570
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Amuro.

571
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's a lie.

572
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's true.

573
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's impossible.

574
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's true.

575
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Listen to me.

576
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's true.

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's true.

578
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's true.

579
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Try it.

580
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll try.

581
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Stop it if you don't like it.

582
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I really don't like it.

583
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're making me do it.

584
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You're making me do it.

585
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You're making me do it.

586
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're making me do it.

587
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm begging you.

588
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You're making me do it.

589
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But when it comes to pregnancy, you have to be careful.

591
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
When it comes to childbirth, you have to be careful.

592
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What was it?

593
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What was it?

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's right.

595
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You have to be careful.

596
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You have to be careful.

597
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Where's the string?

598
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Where's the string?

599
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's not it.

600
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's not it.

601
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's not it.

602
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You can't point that out.

603
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You can't point that out.

604
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But there's that thing.

605
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The Lamaze method.

606
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's called,

607
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You have to breathe in and out.

608
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Try it.

609
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll try.

610
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Breathe in and out.

611
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Breathe in and out.

612
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Breathe in and out.

613
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Breathe in and out.

614
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Breathe in and out.

615
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Breathe in and out.

616
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Breathe in and out.

617
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's right.

618
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You're a weirdo.

619
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You're a weirdo.

620
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You're a nerd.

621
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Stop it!

622
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm done!

623
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That was fast.

624
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was really nervous.

625
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But I didn't forget anything.

626
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I did it as you said.

627
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
As you said.

628
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm half-way through, right?

629
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's right.

630
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's right.

631
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is all thanks to Onuma-san.

632
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't remember anything.

633
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's all thanks to Onuma-san.

634
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Thank you, Onuma-san.

635
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I lowered my head.

636
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I should be able to take a picture.

637
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:20,000
