1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Director Heipou, why did Heipou end up like this?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
4 hours ago, Heipou suddenly appeared at the usual bar.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why does he never set up his own party?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The frightened downtown was planning to set up Heipou's party.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, you guys!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's really amazing.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What the hell are you doing?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Read the atmosphere!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You know what's going on, right?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You guys are always doing stupid things.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do it again.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What the hell is this?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What the hell is this?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, you guys!

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You guys are always doing stupid things.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Read the atmosphere!

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We've been together for 10 years. You know how I feel.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey, you guys!

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You guys are always doing stupid things.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What the hell is this?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Matsumoto!

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's going on with the party you've been planning?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Party?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Party?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Party!

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My parents are telling me to do it quickly, so I have to do it.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's so funny?

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Are you angry?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you don't get married during the wedding, your parents will be sad.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So let's do it!

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's do it!

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We don't know what to do.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Look at this.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a tie.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look at this.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a tie.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've always wanted to do this.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hurry up and do it!

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are you laughing?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What should we do?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We don't know if we'll get a call.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Matsumoto, call Yamazaki immediately.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll do it.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hurry up and do it.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hurry up and do it!

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's crying.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, let's do our best.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's do our best.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Anyway, Heipo's wish came true.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Heipo's wife, Soru Hokusaki, who has been searching for Heipo, has failed.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who will she meet this time?

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The legendary queen of the women's wrestling world, Heipo was in love with her sexy body.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Emergency Project.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The return of Heipo's wife.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you want to do it again?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, I definitely want to do it again.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have a different feeling today.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
After all, it's the end of the 20th century, so I'd like to get married.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Married?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll do it.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll do it.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Really?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll do it.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You'll do it?

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's what I'm going to do.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm the winner.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But he'll do it.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He'll come and do it.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll call him.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Please.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's really like skiing.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a completely different image.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is it different?

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's here.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Please.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry for the sudden visit.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was surprised.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm not good at introducing myself, so please introduce yourself.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Nice to meet you.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My name is Saito.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Nice to meet you.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to be 45 years old.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I heard that you're single.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've been a fan of yours for a while.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Really?

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I brought you here today.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've been watching you for a while.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't look at me like that.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You have a huge nipple.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been wanting to see you for a long time.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Really?

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Everyone was talking about you.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But I couldn't talk to you.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So I've been wanting to see you.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What kind of man do you like?

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If I like him, I don't like him.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's good.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I like someone like you.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Someone like me?

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You have a lot of hair.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I look like him.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you have any special skills?

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you want me to show you?

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Saito has a special skill.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want you to see it all the time.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's see it.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's okay, right?

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you for waiting.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you for waiting.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you for waiting.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You look cool.

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Today, I've prepared a sea bream.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's still alive.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'd like to show you how to make it alive.

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's pretty big.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's big.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's big.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's big.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's big.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you scared?

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, no.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's a sea bream, right?

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll give you a pat.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Please open your mouth.

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll do it.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's a sea bream.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't let it fly away.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Saito.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Saito.

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's a little bit annoying.

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Please stop.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's still alive.

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Mr. Saito, you should handle it.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, that's the main thing.

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You should handle it.

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is a job for fishermen.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I see.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay, okay, okay.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mr. Saito, Mr. Saito.

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What did you say?

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Be careful.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Be careful.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's bad.

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Put it on the cutting board.

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's bad.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Sorry to make you wait.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Please do it.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a sea bream.

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, yes.

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow.

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ah.

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh.

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What are you doing?

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll do it.

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll do it.

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's getting mad.

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going home!

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait a minute!

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you kidding me?

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, I'm not kidding.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a little hot.

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a little hot.

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
On the other hand, we're here, so you're relying on us too much.

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We don't rely on you at all.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We just want to be on TV.

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We just keep appearing on TV.

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Zaito-san, there's a scale here.

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Wait a minute.

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now that we're alone, I think we can talk about this.

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's like we're in the way.

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can have a conversation like this.

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I showed you a picture earlier.

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's take a picture.

214
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Isn't it nice? It's so beautiful.

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, thank you.

216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'd be happy if you could sign this.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I understand.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Can you sign it for me?

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who's going to sign it first?

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I want you to sign it as if you're a soldier.

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm a soldier.

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's easy to understand.

223
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm signing it, too.

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Jaguar Yokota.

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you very much.

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's wonderful.

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's wonderful.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't pull it out.

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's stylish.

230
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And since you wrote this, what is this?

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'd like you to wear a mini skirt.

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, hey, hey.

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It looks good on you.

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've never worn a mini skirt.

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think black stockings are nice.

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'd like you to wear this.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's a shame to wear it at my age.

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's very stylish.

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's very stylish.

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'd rather not wear a mini skirt.

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's wear it.

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I bought it from Jaguar.

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It looks good on you.

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Black and gray go well together.

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why are you so persistent?

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't pull it out at all.

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Black stockings are a must.

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a must.

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a must.

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I like this.

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'd like you to wear this.

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a must.

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a gift.

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a shame.

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'd like to see it.

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'd like to see it.

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're a pervert.

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're a pervert.

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's just for decoration.

260
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll change my clothes if I wear it.

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's very stylish.

263
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't do that.

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it's good, but I chose it.

265
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're changing clothes.

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's from Jaguar.

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right.

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hobby is important.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I like black stockings on my skirt.

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're looking down on me.

271
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's beautiful.

272
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's beautiful.

273
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is it okay?

274
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's sit down and talk.

275
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's embarrassing.

276
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It looks good on you.

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's okay.

278
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's embarrassing.

279
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You don't like it, do you?

280
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't like it.

281
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's embarrassing.

282
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't like it.

283
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's embarrassing.

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Do you like children?

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I like children.

286
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I have children around me.

287
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want a child.

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I want a child.

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want to meet my child.

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to meet my child.

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I want to meet my child.

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I want to meet my child.

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Already?

294
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's right.

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's not over yet.

296
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's okay.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's okay.

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What kind of answer is that?

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's okay.

300
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll put this next to you.

301
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What is it?

302
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What is it?

303
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

304
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What is it?

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What is it?

306
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What is it?

307
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What is it?

308
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll give it to you.

309
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Wait a minute.

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Wait a minute.

311
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I like it.

312
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I like it.

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Wait a minute.

314
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wait a minute.

315
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's okay.

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's okay.

317
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wait a minute.

318
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's okay.

319
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's okay.

320
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I like it.

321
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's okay.

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Wait a minute.

323
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Wait a minute.

324
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's okay.

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait a minute.

326
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait a minute.

327
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wait a minute.

328
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Wait a minute.

329
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was aiming for that from the beginning.

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wait a minute.

331
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Wait a minute.

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I like it.

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I like it.

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's okay.

335
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's okay.

336
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's okay.

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll close it for you.

338
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's okay.

339
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's okay.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Go.

341
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Go.

342
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's a scary conversation.

343
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a scary conversation.

344
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's a scary world.

345
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What is it?

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I like it.

347
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You haven't put it on yet.

348
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You haven't put it on yet.

349
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You haven't put it on yet.

350
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You haven't put it on yet.

351
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I like it.

352
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I like it.

353
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I like it.

354
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's a scary world.

355
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I like it.

356
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can't get married forever.

357
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You idiot.

358
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I like it.

359
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I like it.

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I like it.

361
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I like it.

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll show you this picture.

363
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll show you this picture.

364
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Why is it like this?

365
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't fall in love with me.

366
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to be a flower.

367
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm going to be a flower.

368
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm going to be a wind.

369
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can't wait.

370
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I had a fight with a man who was on the highway.

371
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm a ticket.

372
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

373
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What?

374
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to be a flower.

375
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm going to be a flower.

376
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't have to get a ticket.

377
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You don't have to get a ticket.

378
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's easy to get a ticket.

379
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's easy to get a ticket.

380
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When I gave the ticket to Harada, he grabbed it.

381
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He grabbed the air.

382
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I threw it at him because I was angry.

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I threw it at him because I was angry.

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I threw it at him because I was angry.

385
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I said, you idiot, you don't have to throw anything.

386
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I said, you idiot, you don't have to throw anything.

387
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Harada, who did you ask?

388
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Who did you ask?

389
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's your fault.

390
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is that so?

391
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's your fault.

392
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't think he would come down.

393
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I said, you don't have to throw anything.

394
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I thought it was over.

395
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He came down.

396
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He was angry.

397
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was surprised.

398
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I threw it at him.

399
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I saw a small rice field.

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Three old men came out.

401
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There are many old men who are calculating.

402
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There are many old men who are calculating.

403
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I was surprised.

404
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Everyone was wearing a mask.

405
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Four old men came out.

406
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The next car was coming.

407
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was surprised.

408
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was surprised.

409
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Everyone was wearing a mask.

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Everyone?

411
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was surprised.

412
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I was embarrassed when I was forgiven.

413
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I was embarrassed.

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I thought I was wrong.

415
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I thought I was wrong.

416
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I thought I was wrong.

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I thought I was wrong.

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't think you can get angry at cars.

419
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I want you to do it properly.

420
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When you turn right, you wait for a car coming from the front.

421
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When a car comes from the front, you give priority to the front.

422
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
When a car comes from the front, you give priority to the front.

423
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
When a car comes from the front, you give priority to the front.

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you wait for a long time, you can't stop.

425
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I see.

426
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's not right.

427
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You should ask the teacher again.

428
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You give priority to the front.

429
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But it doesn't matter from the second generation.

430
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You wait for a long time.

431
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I see.

432
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When you get angry, you get angry.

433
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I see.

434
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You don't get angry?

435
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I get angry.

436
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But I can't help it.

437
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You think so, right?

438
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think so.

439
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then you can say it together.

440
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why do you only say it to me?

441
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What's wrong with you?

442
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't help it.

443
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think so.

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're not the only one who stands out in the commercial.

445
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't say that.

446
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're like a soldier to me.

447
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You're an outcast.

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're an outcast.

449
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I heard that there are many creatures that have not yet been confirmed in the deep sea.

450
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who has been diving in the sea for 3,000 meters,

451
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Please tell me what kind of creature you met.

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
All right.

453
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
3,000 meters in the sea?

454
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're going to die.

455
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I knew in advance that I was going to die, so I tried not to die.

456
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
How did you do it?

457
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's 3,000 meters.

458
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was told by force.

459
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, it's 3,000 meters.

460
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
After diving, it's show.

461
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What kind of creature is there?

462
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't think anyone knows this.

463
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Is there a creature?

464
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Basically, it doesn't change that much.

465
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There's a sea bream, a flounder, and a fish that's usually in the deep sea of Japan.

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's 3,000 meters, so there's something like this.

467
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Basically, they're all the same.

468
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What do you mean by basically?

469
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Octopuses and squids.

470
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But what's definitely different is that it says 3,000 on its forehead.

471
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's a big deal.

472
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Tell me what kind of creature you met.

473
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There were a lot.

474
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm sure there were.

475
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There were a lot.

476
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is there anything we've never seen before?

477
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There are fish in shallow places, but if you go further down, there's a deep sea creature.

478
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What?

479
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Deep sea creature.

480
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Sea creature?

481
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sea is the sea.

482
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Human?

483
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Human.

484
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What kind of creature?

485
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Deep sea creature.

486
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What kind of creature?

487
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What do you mean by what kind of creature?

488
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What does it look like?

489
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's almost the same as humans, but it's slightly translucent.

490
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Slightly translucent?

491
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Basically, they all look like they're suffering.

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
They look like they're suffering?

493
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Can you explain?

494
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
They're dead, aren't they?

495
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They're dead.

496
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But they're suffering.

497
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They can't breathe.

498
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There are salaried people, and deep sea creatures.

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, it's not like that.

500
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Sometimes they go up and they can't breathe.

501
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's right.

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're suffering.

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's 3,000 meters.

504
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There are salaried people, and students, but they can't breathe.

505
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's very painful.

506
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's strange.

507
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's why...

508
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They're living there, aren't they?

509
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The salaried people who are waiting at the bus stop...

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
They're suffering.

511
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They want to breathe.

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
For them, they go up to breathe on weekends.

513
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
They're suffering on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

514
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They're quite strong, aren't they?

515
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
On Friday, it's unbearable.

516
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They want to go up.

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's unbearable.

518
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They don't have a family to talk to.

519
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Deep sea creatures.

520
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Deep sea creatures.

521
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That was really amazing.

522
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I've never seen it before.

523
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's the same as a normal human being.

524
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, it's not.

525
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They want to live right above you.

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No, it's not like that.

527
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They're suffering on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

528
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's unbearable.

529
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's amazing.

530
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why do they have to go up to the sea?

531
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
They don't want to cause trouble.

532
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They don't want to cause trouble.

533
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
How many years?

534
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They say that if we go up, the population will increase.

535
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They're very tall people.

536
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
They wear tights.

537
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Why?

538
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Because they can't go up.

539
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They're walking like this.

540
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What is that?

541
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Sometimes there are people who die.

542
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They can't stand it on Thursdays.

543
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They have a nose.

544
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They have a nose.

545
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's amazing.

546
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
They can go up to 3,000 meters.

547
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They fly away.

548
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's unbearable.

549
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They can't stand it.

550
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's unbearable.

551
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They can't go up to 3,000 meters.

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's not good.

553
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There are many people who die.

554
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What do you mean after-life?

555
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I said it's not fun.

556
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I understand.

557
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They'll die of hunger.

558
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's right.

559
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What I want to do the most is eat silkemon.

560
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's in the water.

561
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's in the water.

562
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I think it's hard.

563
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But it can't be helped.

564
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
They were born there.

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They were born there?

566
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They were born there.

567
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
They're from the deep sea.

568
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I see.

569
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
They fly away.

570
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We can't see it from 3,000 meters.

571
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We can't see it.

572
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I want to see it.

573
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
One thing is different.

574
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The thumb of the foot and the index finger are very developed.

575
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The nose is like this.

576
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You grab it.

577
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I grab it.

578
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can't talk.

579
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's right.

580
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I said, why do you make it low?

581
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If you make it a heavy boot, it won't stick here.

582
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I didn't have that idea.

583
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I didn't have that idea.
