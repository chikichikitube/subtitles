1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Please come in.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's start the show. I'm Hamada Masatoshi.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'd like to introduce myself.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I went to Australia the other day. I picked up a girl, but I failed, so I bought a ***.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm Yamasaki Hosei.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm Edson.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I look like this, but when I go back to the company, I'm in a pretty good position.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm Kenji Suga.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Our work is really hard.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yesterday, I swallowed a big sponge.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's true. I almost got ***.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm Matsumoto.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's go.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Read the Atakamo!

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think you know the rules, but please read the Atakamo and pass it on to the next person.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here's the first topic.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How to make a ***.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's ***?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You don't know ***?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't know ***.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
***?

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Read it! Read it!

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How to make a ***.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How to make a ***.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
At one point...

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
At one point...

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How to make a ***.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
At one point, there was a mother and a father.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The father loved sex.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's a great book.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's a great book.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The father had a child.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The child was named Peatan.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When the child grew up, Peatan became a pirate.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The child wanted to be a pirate.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is a big story.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is a big story.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Peatan was born and became a great adult.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What should I do?

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Peatan wants to be a pirate.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Peatan went to look for his friends.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Passed.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Peatan asked Peatan something.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Peatan asked Peatan something.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a bandage in my back.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It wasn't Peatan.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Which Peatan?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
First, to make this Peatan...

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
First, to make this Peatan...

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I enlarged it.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In it...

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There was a cell...

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There was a cell...

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There was a cell...

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Peatan was out of season.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You said it was a bandage.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is a big story.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's continue.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It wasn't Peatan.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It wasn't Peatan.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Peatan was...

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think it was a chick or a chick.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Peatan was Peatan.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And...

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Peatan...

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You read a book.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I read a book.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's written like that.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you put the 3 like this, it will change from Pi-chan to Pi-tan.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The changed Pi-tan is...

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The changed Pi-tan is...

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The changed Pi-tan is...

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It will be like number 1.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The changed Pi-tan is...

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're the only one who can read that.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're laughing too much.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's already over.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If in your class...

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A bit of a bad guy, Hanikamiya-san, changes his class...

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Will that be Pi-tan?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's move on to the next topic.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The King Sadaharu Story.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's not true, Nagashima-san.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's not true, Nagashima-san.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is this the right order?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah, let's change it.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't like it after Jimmy and Yamaaki.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a bit crazy.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The King Sadaharu Story.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's not true, Nagashima-san.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's move on.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Nagashima Shigeo.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I call him Chou-san.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I see.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Chou-san doesn't know much about the rules.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No-out.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Number 1. Number 2.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The opponent's player...

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Gave a fly to Naiya.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now, what is this?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Eh?

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Eh? I didn't hear it.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's next to you.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Listen.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That will be connected later.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, I understand.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The King...

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Gave a fly to Nagashima.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Eh?

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is that Pi-tan?

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's not true, Nagashima-san.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's not true, Nagashima-san.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's over.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Chou-san.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Chou-san.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's Yama-san.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll bring you Fanta.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was so easy between the two of you.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I see.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
One thing led to another.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There was a big fight.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There was a big fight?

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why was there a fight?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The King was very angry.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why?

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Because...

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The King...

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Was late in the morning.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are you blaming yourself?

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The late King said to Nagashima...

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You...

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I was late and you drank too much yesterday.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He said that.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Nagashima was also drinking with him.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What did you talk about at the bar?

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Tell me the cause of the argument.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Tell me the cause of the argument at the bar.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then...

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The Director of the Ministry of Justice...

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What is the Director of the Ministry of Justice?

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The person who gets in between.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The person who gets in between is the Director of the Ministry of Justice?

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The person who gets in between...

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I said it in a difficult way.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry. I didn't notice.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The Director of the Ministry of Justice...

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
came in...

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and used the money...

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to get rid of him.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Headphone!

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Headphone!

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He put on the headphones.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll play the music loudly.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll tell the next person...

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
what the person is saying...

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
only with the movement of his mouth.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Jimmy.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The subject is...

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
this!

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's good.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Please face this way.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's Jiro no Hamada.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's good.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't understand at all.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Say it.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Calm down.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Stop it!

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Stop it!

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Stop it!

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Jiro no...

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hamada.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Kikou mo Hamada.

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's okay.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's okay.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Kikou...

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
mo...

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A...

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ma...

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
ta!

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't understand at all.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Kikou mo...

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hamada.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Mazo-san, you're correct.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Isozuri Hamada.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Kokon Tozai...

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oketsu ni Monmari!

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you understand the rules?

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We'll play Kokon Tozai.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you can't answer, you lose.

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Mazo-san, if you can't answer,

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Jimmy-chan will come to you.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's so dirty!

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Isn't it raw?

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yamazaki-san, the producer's butt...

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The producer's butt is getting closer.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's go!

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yamazaki-san first.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Kokon Tozai.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Kokumin no Shukujitsu.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Tenno Tanjoubi.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Midori no Hi.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Taiku no Hi.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Kodomo no Hi.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Keiro no Hi.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Setsubun...

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Setsubun...

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Jimmy-chan, start!

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ok!

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What are you doing?

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It looks like a hole.

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ian, hurry up!

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is no good.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's really...

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a good example.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you listen to this,

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you'll lose strength in your body.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But today's guest is always healthy.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Now you can even look at someone's butt.

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're looking at everything.

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Now you're looking at me.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm in a bad mood.

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, no.

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Like you just saw,

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Jimmy's butt came up to there.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Since then, my right half of my body has been numb.

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I know, I know.

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, let's move on.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Is this a new joke?

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not a new joke.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've never said it before.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's one of those 100 jokes.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why?

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm 31 years old, right?

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I've been a cherry boy for 10 years.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I've been a cherry boy for 10 years.

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So what?

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Listen to my reply.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's a good reply.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I had my first experience when I was 16.

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How many years has it been?

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I've been a player for 15 years.

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm a little tired of it.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Is that so?

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've come to understand women's stupidity.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I see.

253
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Women are stupid.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What?

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What?

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What do you mean by women?

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Did someone teach you?

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

259
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is there a manual?

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When you do it?

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes.

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What is it?

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well...

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well...

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's not it.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There must have been something between you and me.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But women always say that.

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well...

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Well...

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well...

271
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What's wrong with you?

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're like a light and a shadow.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You always say the opposite.

274
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you an amateur?

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
No, no.

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You always say, one, one, meow.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I agree with you.

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's strange.

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I want you to say, sit down.

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Sit down.

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Sit down.

283
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sit down.

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What are you saying?

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't hate it when you say, I don't like it.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I see.

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If you don't say, I don't like it,

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
you're forcing yourself.

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, no, no, no, no.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You can't say that.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you don't say, I don't like it,

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
if you don't say,

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't like it.

294
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You can't say that.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, I can.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You always say, I want you.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Who taught you that?

298
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Who taught you that?

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Moe, Moe.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Who taught you that?

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, that's how it is.

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm saying it.

303
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm saying it.

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, well.

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm saying it.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No, no, no, no, no.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's fine.

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What is that?

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What kind of dance is that?

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What?

312
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What kind of dance is that?

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There is a dance called the Matsumoto style.

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is that a dance?

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is that a dance?

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes, there is.

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There are various things.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes, there are various things.

319
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, shall we go to the post office?

320
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Sure.

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The opening is really long,

322
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
it would be a waste if we talk too much.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But you see,

324
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm always on the back of the program,

325
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

328
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

329
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There are a lot of videos.

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You, you,

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time,

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I have to be careful about you,

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You have nothing to do with what you're saying.

336
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You'd better stop that.

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're in charge of the video now.

338
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What is this?

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No.

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It doesn't make sense.

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

342
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're in charge of the video now.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You, you,

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Stop.

346
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You're in charge of the video now.

347
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Stop talking.

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What kind of behavior did you do when you were said that?

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't understand.

350
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're really funny!

351
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm in charge of the video now.

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait a minute.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What kind of behavior did you do?

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What kind of meaningless behavior did you do?

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You did it.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't know what you mean. You should do it properly.

358
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You're funny too.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You should do it properly.

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You should do it properly.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can't do it.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What do you mean?

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I should be careful.

364
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We should do it together.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We should do it together.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Come and do it!

367
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can't do it.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let me do it freely.

369
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't do it.

370
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So in that video...

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't do it.

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I can't do it.

373
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
In that video, there's a lot of it.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's what I mean.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Normally, it's edited a lot.

376
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Please brush your teeth.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know what you mean.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I almost died today.

380
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Why?

381
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I drank spondia.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's why.

383
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Spondia?

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No, it's hanging.

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a game with legs.

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you fall, it's a mountain of sponges.

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you fall, it's a mountain of sponges.

388
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I drank it.

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I ran with a big face.

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I was too excited.

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I was too excited.

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I drank sponges.

393
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm serious.

394
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Are you okay?

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm sure you're okay.

396
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
When Machan eats at home, why does he have 7 chopsticks in his head?

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There are 7 types of food.

398
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Say it.

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Meat or...

400
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Meat or...

401
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Meat or...

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What else do you think?

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You said you had it, so you say it.

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Fish.

405
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Fish or...

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What else do you have?

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Say it.

408
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll tell you later.

409
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Let's put it all in.

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What do you mean?

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Meat or fish.

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
When you eat fish, you say it's okay.

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's almost summer.

414
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I have a weak body, so I can't go to the beach.

415
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
How can I be a macho man like you?

416
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
How did you become a macho man?

417
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll tell you.

418
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'll tell you later.

419
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Let's run.

420
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When did you become a macho man?

421
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll tell you later.

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We came here about 5 years ago.

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You became a macho man in 5 years?

424
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If I started on Monday, I would have become a macho man on Tuesday.

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Pascal says that if Cleopatra's nose was a little higher, the world would have changed.

426
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Mr. Matsumoto, how did it change?

427
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
History is scary.

428
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It changes a lot with a little change.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
With a little change.

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
For example, you are now doing something called Tsukkomi.

431
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's right.

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
For example, if this hand was longer.

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
For example, if this hand was 2 meters.

434
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Only this hand?

435
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If this hand was only 2 meters, downtown's comedy would be like this.

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But at that point, would you choose me as your partner?

437
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A man who is 2 meters tall.

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He's walking with his arms pulled back.

439
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's right.

440
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
From that point of view, downtown didn't exist.

441
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If it was longer.

442
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If it was longer, downtown didn't exist in Japan.

443
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It didn't.

444
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There is a man who is walking with his arms pulled back because of the rumors.

445
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's a scary story of elementary school students.

446
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
A dog often chases its tail and turns around.

447
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What is that? Mr. Matsumoto, please tell us.

448
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
After all, this is a high spirit.

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
A dog?

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
A dog that wants to raise its rank.

451
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
A dog?

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
A dog itself?

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
A dog that wants to move forward.

454
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
A dog that wants to live a life that is one rank higher.

455
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It has nothing to do with a dog.

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
For example, a dog that wants to raise its rank as a talent.

457
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's right.

458
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Everyone wants to be one rank higher.

459
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's right.

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Even a bird wants to fly higher.

461
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's right.

462
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Even a dog wants to turn around.

463
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's right.

464
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
A dog wants to turn around.

465
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
A dog wants to turn around.

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A dog wants to turn around and become an old man.

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What makes you sad?

468
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You can't be an old man.

469
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Ah!

470
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No, no, no.

471
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
My line is...

472
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Aoka, you...

473
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Everyone stops you immediately.

474
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
When a dog turns around, you say,

475
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You idiot.

476
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And you hug it.

477
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Please leave it alone.

478
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
A dog turns around and becomes an old man.

479
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Hamada-kun, you...

480
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's true.

481
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's scary.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You say,

483
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Let's do a lottery.

484
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't have any money left.

485
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
From a dog to a brand new dog.

486
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't have any money left.

487
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I want to see that.

488
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's true.

489
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's amazing.

490
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
When a dog turns around, it's true.

491
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
A dog turns around and becomes an old man.

492
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Can you take a picture of me?

493
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why?

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You have a round face.

495
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's true.

496
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's true.
