1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
First episode!

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,000
The Gaki no Tsukai Alliance, Chikichiki Yamazaki Produce

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is...

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Tantan Keikaku!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You can't produce.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I can!

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can bite it?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can also do a bang!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Like this.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Like this.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's not good.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Lately, I've been slacking off.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, I'm still the same as when I was a rookie.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's not good.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You have to change it!

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But that's not good.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I said that, but did you think it was bad?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I thought it was bad.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What do you usually do?

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What do you usually do?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do you make jokes?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't talk to me again.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You only play games.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's dark!

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can't do that.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This time, you have to go back to when you were a rookie.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You have to make a joke.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A comic?

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
A comic!

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I wrote a joke.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Really.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Can you do it?

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's really your idea, isn't it?

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, it's really my idea.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I thought about it a lot.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The name Downtown is old.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's called Grand Bazaar.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's a combination of our names.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's not good.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, no, no.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to sell it.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What should I do with this?

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Can I write it in my own way?

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Or should I say it one by one?

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As it is.

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's been calculated all the time.

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is Grand Bazaar.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Merci.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not Merci.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Merci.

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's Merci.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do you want to destroy me?

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you want to destroy me?

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
At first.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It comes out like this, right?

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Come out.

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello, this is Grand Bazaar.

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hello, this is Grand Bazaar.

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello, this is Grand Bazaar.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Merci.

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Merci.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Merci.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Merci.

72
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Merci.

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Merci.

74
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is Grand Bazaar.

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, it's bad.

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I thought it was an interesting movement.

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was surprisingly normal.

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is Grand Bazaar.

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I went to the zoo the other day.

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why?

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is it wrong?

83
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll do it a little more.

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why?

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll pull it.

86
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I went to the zoo the other day.

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why?

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm surprised.

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know what to do.

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I didn't say anything strange.

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was pulled here.

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know what to do.

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't do it without shaking it.

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm scared.

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll do it.

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then the girl.

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

99
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know what to do.

100
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll say it.

101
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He says his role.

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He doesn't need a girl.

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He doesn't need a girl.

104
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He says, I don't need a girl.

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I understand.

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then the girl.

107
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll go this way.

109
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This way.

110
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll walk this way.

111
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait a minute.

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I walked.

113
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't stop here.

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't say such a stupid thing.

115
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm stupid.

116
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't know what to do.

118
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is hard.

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
My face is red.

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where is Rori from Asia?

121
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Where is Rori from Asia?

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't do it.

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm wearing a jump suit.

124
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Did you know this?

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Are you inside the car?

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm walking!

127
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey, you're hitting my shoulder.

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What are you doing?

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're doing it!

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is the impersonation of a gorilla.

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Osaka...

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Here, here. Osaka's famous punch, punch, punch.

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What the hell?

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, yes.

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What is that?

136
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean?

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't get it.

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why is it called what the hell?

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Osaka's famous punch, punch, punch.

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What the hell is that?

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Should I go forward?

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What the hell is that?

143
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, yes, yes.

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, yes, yes.

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is there anything to look at the hair?

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, this.

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you okay?

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
At the end, just say, it's over.

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's over.

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Should I say, it's over?

151
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's over!

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's over!

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Be careful at the end.

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Me too?

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

157
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you want to do it together?

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't remember.

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's all over the place.

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's all the other way around.

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's all the other way around.

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You have to talk about it.

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right.

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, well, well.

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't worry about the details.

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't worry about the details.

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The basics, the basics.

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's okay, it's okay.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't think I can do it.

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can do it.

171
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Be confident.

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
More.

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, it's not.

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Be confident.

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not that I'm not confident.

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't be nervous.

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't laugh at all.

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Be serious.

179
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Be serious.

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you do your best, I think you can do it.

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you do your best, I think you can do it.

182
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You guys are the ones who can do it.

183
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, it's okay.

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, no, no, no, no.

185
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right.

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not organized at all.

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wrote a story for downtown.

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'd like you to see that story.

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is a grand buzzer.

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please.

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am an animal hider.

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Healthy.

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Merci.

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,860
Hon madam

195
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
I'm back!

196
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
I went to the zoo the other day.

197
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
What the hell?!

198
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,860
There are a lot of things to learn about animals.

199
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
What do you mean?

200
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Animals are more colorful than humans.

201
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Colorful?!

202
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
Even if you say it's colorful...

203
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
For example, when you go out to pick up girls,

204
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
it's like this, right?

205
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Excuse me, would you like some tea?

206
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Something like that.

207
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Well, at first...

208
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
You can't do that.

209
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
After all, you have to learn about animals.

210
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Animals are amazing.

211
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
How to pick up.

212
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,860
For example, you have to learn about the nine-legged qi.

213
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
That's going to be super!

214
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,860
That's something you should learn about.

215
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,860
But it's beautiful, but it's too flashy.

216
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
No, it's not like that.

217
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Let's try it.

218
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Then the girl, right?

219
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Walk over here.

220
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,860
It's a short tongue, isn't it?

221
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
A person or a human?

222
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,860
And there's no chicken.

223
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,860
But you said the short tongue was pretty good.

224
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Now keep walking.

225
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Excuse me.

226
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,860
Long for me is the age-o

227
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
A woman is a sea

228
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Judy Long! Why?

229
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
What? What do you mean what?

230
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,860
I'm surprised. Girls are troublesome.

231
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
I'm surprised too.

232
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Yes.

233
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,860
After all, animals are amazing when it comes to food.

234
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
What do you mean?

235
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,860
It's amazing no matter what you eat.

236
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
The meat and vegetables are fresh.

237
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
Very healthy.

238
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
Very strong.

239
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Grandfather!

240
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,860
What's wrong with you?

241
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,860
You fight too, right?

242
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
Well, there are many things that make me angry.

243
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Yes. In that case, learn from Gorilla-san.

244
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Gorilla?

245
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Gorilla is amazing.

246
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Yes.

247
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Let's try it.

248
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Yes.

249
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Oh, you hit me in the shoulder.

250
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
What?

251
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
What are you doing?

252
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
By the way, I'm Karate 8 dan.

253
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
What?

254
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
It's a communication karaoke.

255
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
What is that?

256
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,860
That's a fool of communication education.

257
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Don't make a mistake.

258
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Yes.

259
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,860
You do it properly.

260
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Well, I'm walking.

261
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Oh.

262
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Hey, you hit me in the shoulder.

263
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
What?

264
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
What are you doing?

265
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
Do it!

266
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Huh?

267
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Oh, it looks strong.

268
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Osaka specialty, Pachi Pachi Punch.

269
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,860
What?

270
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,860
After all, there are many things to learn.

271
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,860
This is amazing.

272
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,860
Well, there are times when you are busy and you can't eat, right?

273
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
Yes, there are.

274
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
It's hard.

275
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
It's not delicious even if I eat it.

276
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Yes.

277
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,860
But I'll break my body if I don't eat it.

278
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Yes, yes.

279
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
In that case, you should learn Rakuda.

280
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
Rakuda is taking nutrition from kelp.

281
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,860
No matter how busy Rakuda is, it doesn't do anything like eating while moving.

282
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
There is no time when Rakuda is busy.

283
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Really, Rakuda.

284
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
It's a joke.

285
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
It's forbidden.

286
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,860
After all, you can't buy animals.

287
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,860
Well, I used to have a dog.

288
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
Oh, you have to buy it when you come to Tokyo, right?

289
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
No.

290
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Oh, what?

291
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
Have you ever had a pet?

292
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
Of course I have.

293
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
What does it smell like?

294
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
Kijirami.

295
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:59,860
I don't like it.

296
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
It's broken.

297
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
It's messed up.

298
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,860
This is a strawberry.

299
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,860
I told you not to make a mistake.

300
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,860
It's strange, isn't it?

301
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Because I suddenly went to the zoo the other day.

302
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Why?

303
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
That's strange.

304
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
You don't have to go.

305
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,860
And it says pull here.

306
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Why are you wearing this?

307
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
It's cold.

308
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
It's really funny.

309
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
Why?

310
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,860
You're not good at it.

311
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,860
I can't do it.

312
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
You can't do it all.

313
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
I can't do it.

314
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
You did it properly.

315
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
I was sweating when I fell asleep.

316
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
I can't do it.

317
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,860
You're the one who can't do it.

318
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Hey.

319
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Wait a minute.

320
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,860
There's a sub.

321
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,860
Ladies and gentlemen.

322
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,860
That's great.

323
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
It was easy to get in today.

324
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,860
The toilet was good today.

325
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,860
I put a tag on it before I went in.

326
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,860
Because it's their names.

327
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,860
When I'm in, I flip it over.

328
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
I'm using it.

329
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
I've been waiting outside.

330
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,860
It's like a judo club.

331
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
I'm in now.

332
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,860
I have to do my best to talk today.

333
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,860
I have to take back the first half.

334
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
What do you mean by the first half?

335
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,860
I'm wondering if it's okay.

336
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
You'll know if you watch it from the beginning.

337
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
If you turn on the TV in the middle.

338
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
That's hard.

339
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,860
What kind of story are you talking about?

340
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,860
I told you to put it on the screen.

341
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,860
It's a threat.

342
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
It's a threat.

343
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Yamazaki's story.

344
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,860
It's a story.

345
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,860
It's really cold.

346
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,860
It's really cold.

347
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,860
You've been waiting for a long time.

348
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
What did you do at the end of the story?

349
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
Did you go outside once?

350
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Didn't you go out once?

351
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I had to fix it again.

352
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,860
What do you all do at that time?

353
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,860
I smoke outside.

354
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
I smoke.

355
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Do you feel good when you touch your genitals?

356
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,860
I feel good.

357
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,860
I've been touching my genitals for a long time.

358
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,860
Is that so?

359
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I usually touch my genitals when I have a lot of time.

360
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Time flies.

361
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,860
It's completely different from the five minutes I've been touching my genitals.

362
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,860
For me, it's golden time.

363
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
In a sense.

364
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,860
It seems that you're not feeling well.

365
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,860
I don't care.

366
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Wait a minute.

367
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
You're weird.

368
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
You were like that before.

369
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,860
You said you were sick.

370
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,860
You said you had a fever.

371
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
I don't care.

372
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,860
Why are you angry?

373
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,860
I'm saying this as a caretaker.

374
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,860
It's okay.

375
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
It's just a cold.

376
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Did you catch a cold at the end of the year?

377
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
No.

378
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
What?

379
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,860
This is a holiday.

380
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,860
Don't say that.

381
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Why are you angry?

382
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
What is it?

383
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,860
What is it?

384
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
What is it?

385
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,860
I don't care about your height.

386
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
What kind of world is this?

387
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
I don't care about your height.

388
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Who do you want me to tell?

389
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,860
I don't know.

390
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,860
I went to Disneyland.

391
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,860
I don't care.

392
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
I don't care.

393
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,860
No matter how many times I go in, Cinderella Castle is fun.

394
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Do you know?

395
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
I know.

396
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
But I don't care.

397
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,860
I'm scared.

398
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,860
You're the worst.

399
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Please come here.

400
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
I like that kind of thing.

401
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I don't care.

402
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Do you like that kind of thing?

403
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
I like it very much.

404
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,860
What are you doing now?

405
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,860
I'm afraid of water.

406
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,860
I'm afraid of water.

407
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,860
I have a question for Matsumoto, who was chosen by the man who looks most like a cola in Japan.

408
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Please tell me how to drink cool cola.

409
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
I don't know why I don't have a cola commercial.

410
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,860
What?

411
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
How to drink cool?

412
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Please drink it.

413
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Wow!

414
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Old man!

415
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,860
I hit you twice.

416
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Well, that's fine.

417
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Bring a washing machine.

418
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Put the washing machine on your face.

419
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Like this.

420
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
Like this.

421
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
The bottle is flying away.

422
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
No, no, no.

423
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,860
I'm holding it.

424
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
What?

425
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,860
How do you hold it?

426
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Like this.

427
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Put the washing machine here.

428
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Like this.

429
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
I see.

430
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,860
This movement is cool.

431
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
It doesn't matter if you open the bottle.

432
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
Let's go from there.

433
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
I'm a drinker.

434
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,860
You wake up in the morning and open the curtain.

435
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
I wake up in the morning and drink cola.

436
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Of course.

437
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,860
You wake up in the morning and open the curtain.

438
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
And then...

439
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
What?

440
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,860
You wake up in the morning and open the curtain.

441
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
What?

442
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,860
You wake up in the morning and open the curtain.

443
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
That's strange.

444
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
You wake up in the morning and open the curtain.

445
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
Either way.

446
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
And then...

447
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Open the fridge.

448
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
I didn't see it.

449
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
One more time.

450
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
Open the fridge.

451
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
And then...

452
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Why are you laughing?

453
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
Because I have cola.

454
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Why do you look so sad?

455
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
No, no.

456
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
You look sad.

457
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Wait a minute.

458
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Action!

459
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Like this.

460
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
Your face is different.

461
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
You have a refreshing face.

462
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Yes, I have a refreshing face.

463
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
And then...

464
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
And then...

465
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,860
Like this.

466
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
And then...

467
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
You break it.

468
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,860
I'm not laughing.

469
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,860
What's funny?

470
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,860
You look cool and you take an egg.

471
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,860
It has nothing to do with the cola commercial.

472
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,860
It's a breakfast commercial.

473
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
And then...

474
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
You take it.

475
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
What's that?

476
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
This is cola.

477
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Okay.

478
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Like this.

479
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
And then...

480
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
You pull the string.

481
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
And then...

482
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
And then...

483
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Yes, cola.

484
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,860
Someone come here!

485
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
What's yes, cola?

486
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Yes, cola, yes.

487
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
It takes a lot of time.

488
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Really?

489
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
You have a refreshing face.

490
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Okay.

491
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
And then...

492
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
You wake up.

493
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
You have to do it from there.

494
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
You come back.

495
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
What?

496
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
You come back.

497
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
And then...

498
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
You come back.

499
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
And then...

500
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Hey, hey, hey.

501
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
Sakata Toshio.

502
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
Let's be cool.

503
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Let's be cool.

504
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,860
You're a cute old man.

505
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
You open it.

506
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,860
Yes, cola, yes.

507
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
And then...

508
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,860
You cry.

509
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
What are you doing?

510
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,860
Who are you drinking it to?

511
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
There's someone behind you and you're drinking it.

512
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
Your shoulder is all wet.

513
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,860
What are you doing?

514
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,860
Drink it!

515
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
You're trapped in concrete.

516
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Yes, yes.

517
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
You're thrown into the sea.

518
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,860
You're chained and the building explodes.

519
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
You always escape in five seconds.

520
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,860
The voice of the third generation of Hikita Tenko is also loud, Matsumoto-san.

521
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
I'm going to sing a song.

522
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Yes, yes, yes.

523
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,860
A big tsunami is coming from the west sea.

524
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,860
A big eruption is coming from the east mountain and lava is coming.

525
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,860
A huge tornado is approaching from the southern land.

526
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,860
A huge snowstorm is coming from the northern snowy mountains.

527
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,860
When you're in danger, how do you get out of this situation?

528
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,860
To put it simply, when I'm in danger...

529
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
What?

530
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,860
You're mumbling.

531
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,860
I really want to say this to everyone.

532
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
You want to say it, don't you?

533
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
I really want to say this.

534
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Why don't you say it twice?

535
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Because I want to say it.

536
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Do you understand?

537
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,860
You have a mekuso here.

538
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
I want to wear a mekuso.

539
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
You have a mekuso on your right.

540
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,860
I really want to wear it.

541
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
You have a mekuso on your right.

542
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
I really want to wear it.

543
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
No, you don't.

544
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I really want to wear it.

545
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
It's hard for me.

546
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Please remember this.

547
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,860
If you don't like it, for example, bullying.

548
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,860
When you're so involved, what I really want to say is...

549
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,860
When you're in danger, your mind goes, oh my god.

550
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,860
For example, when you're bullied, when you get milk on your head,

551
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,860
your mind goes, oh my god.

552
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,860
I want you to keep that in mind.

553
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Like your jaw is broken.

554
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Do you understand?

555
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,860
There's nothing you can't get away with.

556
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,860
It's not like that.

557
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,860
When you're so involved, when you get milk on your head,

558
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
your mind goes, oh my god.

559
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
I want you to keep that in mind.

560
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
I want you to keep that in mind.

561
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
I won't.

562
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
I'll do it.

563
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,860
Can you pour me some milk?

564
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
Oh my god.

565
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,860
Oh my god.

566
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
Oh my god.

567
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
That's enough.

568
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
That's enough.

569
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Stop it!

570
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
As a sex counselor in the entertainment industry,

571
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
I've been consulted by various entertainers.

572
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,860
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

573
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,860
It's like, I've been waiting for this.

574
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Yes, that's fine.

575
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,860
When you go out for sex,

576
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,860
please tell me the most comfortable way to live in this world.

577
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
What are you talking about?

578
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
How to live?

579
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
How to live.

580
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
I don't know how to live.

581
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,860
For example, what about your face?

582
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
That's a lie.

583
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,860
You know,

584
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,860
you just killed yourself.

585
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Why?

586
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Why?

587
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
Like this.

588
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
I have to put up with it.

589
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
You have to put up with it.

590
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
Absolutely not.

591
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
I have to put up with it.

592
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
You have to completely let go of yourself.

593
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,860
Make a loud voice.

594
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
How?

595
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
It doesn't matter.

596
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,860
More!

597
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
No!

598
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,860
Can't you do it five times louder?

599
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
Ah!

600
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
I'm scared of women who have sex.

601
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,860
I'm not scared.

602
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
I'm not scared.

603
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Women are the same.

604
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Women are the same.

605
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
What?

606
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
I can do it like that.

607
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
So,

608
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
are you ready?

609
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,860
You go to sleep.

610
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
Wait a minute.

611
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,860
Can you see it?

612
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Can you see it?

613
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Like this, right?

614
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,860
What?

615
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
Well, well, well.

616
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
It's okay.

617
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
Do whatever you want.

618
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Right?

619
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,860
When it comes,

620
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Hey!

621
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Don't leave me alone!

622
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Everyone is too embarrassed.

623
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
No, you always say,

624
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Ah!

625
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
You always say,

626
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Ah!

627
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
You always say,

628
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
Ah!

629
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
What else do you say?

630
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,860
You say,

631
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Ah!

632
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
No, I mean,

633
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
You normally say,

634
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Oh, sorry.

635
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm sorry.

636
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,860
Normally?

637
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,860
You sound like a man!

638
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
I'm starting now.

639
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
What?

640
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,860
The high-pitched tone before going,

641
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
So,

642
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
You say,

643
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Ah!

644
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Right?

645
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
Is that okay?

646
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,860
If you say so!

647
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,860
