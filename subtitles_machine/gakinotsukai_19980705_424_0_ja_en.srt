1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the past 3 episodes, the famous people of the entertainment world competed in the black bass fishing tournament.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This time, the fishermen gathered with the pride of men.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the first and second episodes, Matsumoto won the championship in a row.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Last year, Itoi Shigesato won the first prize.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Who will be the winner this year?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the fourth episode, the entertainment world fishers will compete in the black bass fishing tournament.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're here!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes!

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's the first time for me

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the first time for me

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First of all, this person

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Who is it?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Recently, on the weekend, he played a game with his child in the park

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hamada Matsumoto!

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, he's here

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You called me here

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm the host

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm the host

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Nice to meet you

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm an amateur

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No!

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're the 6th year

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Are you okay?

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've never won a championship.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's right.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll do my best today.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please win a big one.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Next,

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He is a man who has recently improved his resistance to fat.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He is Mr. Matsumoto.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dangerous.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I know this.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's dangerous!

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll do my best today.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm aiming for the victory and going home.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes!

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why are you doing that?

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not like that.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's go.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's more popular than your CD.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okada Tamio!

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Nice to meet you!

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Nice to meet you!

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How do you feel about us?

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know yet.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Nice to meet you!

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Every time the long-legger is on the air, the shampoo smells good.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yosuke Inochi!

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you for coming!

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Nice to meet you!

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Nice to meet you!

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing?

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you wait for something?

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, no, no. I didn't ask anything.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you for coming!

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now, the next guest is amazing.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's his first appearance.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's introduce the super big guest.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mr. Yabunagi Yone!

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you for your hard work!

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm so happy today.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've been in the entertainment industry for 11 years and I've been ranked the same as everyone else.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I heard that you're the same age as Eguchi.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right. I'm Eguchi.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Eguchi?

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm a new member of the team.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you know Voice?

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is Voice?

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to sing and drink it.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're a good singer.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll sing next to you.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And then, I'll do the fishing.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the last one.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Itoi Shiritoshi!

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I want to hear your name.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who is it?

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, I see. Itoi-san won the last time.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I did.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, I see.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
While being banned from puns.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
While being banned from puns.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, let's start the meeting.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Tanaka-san, please say hello.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A greeting of the meeting.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A greeting of the meeting.

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Please.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I want to see you guys, B-class talent and C-class copywriters, gather together and do something.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't think I can do it, but I don't know what's fun about fishing when you can't even fish.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's tough.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Anyway, everyone, do your best!

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Amazing!

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Start!

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's been a while since I've been to Kawasaki.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It seems that the situation isn't very good.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just don't want to be around them.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please take care of me.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm going to step up to the top 5, so I'm going to aim for 4th place.

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going to enjoy it.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's been a while since I've been fishing.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'd like to be in 2nd place, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'd like to enjoy it.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey! Why are you so far away?

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey!

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm here!

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
For the sake of the rainy season, there are many people here and Kawaguchiko is in an unstable condition.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Of course, the points to be caught are limited, and the three seats are gathered at one point to start casting.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is the musician duo of Hamada and Okuda.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What about a day with a wind like this?

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The wind is strong and his condition is terrible. He is a very angry person.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Itoi's father seems to be able to catch fish.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is a new father-gag duo, Matsumoto and Itoi.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have a bad feeling about today.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What is it?

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Will you fall off the boat?

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, no, no. I think it's okay.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think so, too.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes!

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The first hit is Shigesato Itoi.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What?

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is it big?

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, it's small.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Itoi-san, I gave it to you.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Really?

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey, hey, hey.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's just as I said.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hamada and Okuda are in a hurry

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And here is Eguchi and Yamazaki's duo

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yamazaki, you're ready to go online?

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm ready to go online

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll save you anytime

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No matter how much

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For some reason, Yamazaki is being polite

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is the first prey?

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's a big one

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
A big one?

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A big one

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is it?

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Huh?

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, it's coming

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Eguchi, did it hit?

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a hit!

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The two feel the impact

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a hit!

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a hit!

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Idiot

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
On the other hand, Hamada and Okuda have no chance of winning

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Come on, Okuda

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm going

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hamada is in a good mood. He looks serious.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you come here, I will throw you.

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go away!

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I will hit you.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
30 minutes have passed since the start. Matsumoto has no fish.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He has not caught anything since the beginning.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If I catch one more fish, I will be relieved.

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Matsumoto is also anxious.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I got a hit!

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is the first hit for Yamazaki.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait a minute.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You did it.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You were ahead of me.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He said that he was tired and had a cold.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
His body is weak.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
His body is very weak.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He got caught by the camera.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Matsumoto also got a hit.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He got a hit.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's not bad.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He got a hit.

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Slowly.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Slowly.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
OK.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was good.

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm so relieved!

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're good.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't believe I caught such a big one.

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hamada and Okuda move to the next spot.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okuda caught something for the first time.

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is so small.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I got something.

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I caught a big one.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is so great.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is great.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Only Eguchi and Hamada are not caught.

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's time to put the fish in the net.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I brought the fish in the net.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you.

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Eguchi's fish was broken.

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll give you a whole fish.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Is this a calcium fish?

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There are still fish.

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is a Japanese fish called calcium.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I thought you would be able to do it.

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What's going on between you two?

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a love-dutch pair.

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
A love-dutch pair?

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Please talk to me.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please talk to me properly.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't talk when I'm drunk.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't have a hangover.

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
No?

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's good.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What a child.

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh no!

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hamada is frustrated. At that moment, the rod is bent.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is this? What is this?

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What is this?

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look at this! This is bent!

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's bent like this.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Damn!

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Seriously?

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What is this?

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why am I like this?

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
On the other hand, Eguchi is also impatient.

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't want to be a stickman after this.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I know.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is bad.

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I know.

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
At that time, Hamada is the first to be hit.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This looks big.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was caught.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Really?

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's okay.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's big.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Should I wind it?

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's big.

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes!

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's big.

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes!

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's big.

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is bad.

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is bad!

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is bad!

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Eguchi is panicking.

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Alright!

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What is that thing you're holding in your hand?

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This is...

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is the V.O. of the brand that Hana-san is promoting.

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to drink this V.O.

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We have a telegram for you, Sabino-san.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Telegram?

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okuda-san, nice to meet you. I'm Koko Riko.

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Nice to meet you.

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You guys?

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We're about to debut as a group on Okuda-san's show.

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you.

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Please support us.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Meanwhile, Itoi hits the second one.

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But it's around there, right?

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's coming!

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's really coming.

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Really?

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm starting to feel the pressure

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
On the other hand, after catching the first fish, Masumoto has no luck

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And Kokoriko appears with a sash

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hey! Big talent!

279
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What do you think?

280
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You caught one, right?

281
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Really?

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mr. Idori is the second place

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What do you think, Mr. CQ Rider?

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
CQ?

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sougo-san is CQ?

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have a photo.

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
First, I have a photo of Toji-san.

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Please ask.

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Since I don't have a sense of humor, I often get to see humor and jokes.

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think that's important.

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Toji-san's remodeling course.

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's good.

293
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the same as before.

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I read the book, but it doesn't get fixed.

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You read it well.

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you very much.

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I have a photo of Mademou.

298
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What is it?

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's the same book.

300
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's not a copy.

301
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thank you very much.

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Thank you.

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You are a pervert.

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You are a pervert.

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You are a pervert.

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You are thinking about weird things.

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm a pervert, too.

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But I can't win against you.

310
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I lost.

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Did you see Hamada's video?

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I didn't see it.

313
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But I heard it was big.

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You said it with your mouth.

315
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was very happy.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's pretty big.

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's as big as the Macadamia nuts.

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you say it's a nut, it's as big as the Macadamia nuts.

319
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Really?

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It looks big!

321
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll stand it up.

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Alright!

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm not in the way.

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're in the way.

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Everyone, it's Downtown Lure Time!

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Downtown Lure Time was introduced last year.

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This time, it was newly developed as a lure that can be caught in earnest.

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Who will be the winner?

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's choose the winner.

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
First, the musician team.

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll take it.

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you want to do it?

334
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll do it.

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then, you do it yourself.

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll do it with Matsumoto Rua.

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, no!

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Ouch!

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I got it!

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I got it at first!

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I got it at the Matsumoto Tour in Hamada!

342
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Then, Matsumoto-san.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes.

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll do it with Hamada.

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Matsumoto-san, Hamada Rua.

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hitoh-san, please do it with Matsumoto Rua.

347
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Eguchi-san, do it with Matsumoto Rua.

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes, Matsumoto Rua.

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Nohoshi-san, do it with Hamada Rua.

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you ready?

351
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

352
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Ready, start!

353
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Start!

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How good is Downtown Lure?

355
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, it's swimming properly

356
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's swimming!

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's really not impossible to catch it

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's not zero

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It might be better than the last time

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The color is pretty plain, Masamodo Lure

361
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
At times like this, the fish are going to be caught

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, it's clear

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's a waste of time.

364
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Time is useless.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can't catch it.

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Good luck. It's 100,000 yen.

367
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You know you can't catch it, so you're saying 100,000 yen.

368
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There is no hit or shit.

369
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The downtown lower time is over!

370
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yay!

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That was great!

372
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yay!

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yay!

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
One person, Eguchi, who can't catch anything.

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can't catch anything.

376
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why?

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is not the end.

378
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Eguchi, who keeps asking himself the same question, is screaming in his heart.

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Ah!

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hmm?

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you coming?

382
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Did he run away?

383
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He ran away.

384
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What?

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That was a big one.

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Did you get hurt?

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well...

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't think I would get hurt this much.

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Ah...

391
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

392
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How is it?

393
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Eh?

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Are you fishing?

395
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why are you eating the bait?

396
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Fish, fish.

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Why are you eating the bait?

398
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Eh?

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I know it's hard to get into that kind of character.

400
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not like that.

401
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
How is it, Tamiyo?

402
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll do my best!

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm coming!

404
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You said it too much!

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry, Tano-san!

406
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You said it too much!

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The exit where he moved repeatedly and looked for the right point,

408
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
changed the lures and went out to the last corner.

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There was a man's will.

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll definitely do it.

411
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The first one to arrive is...

412
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is this how you do it?

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's coming!

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's coming!

415
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!

416
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Wait a minute, the drag...

417
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The drag is hard.

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's huge!

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's huge!

420
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What are you doing?

421
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Reel! Reel!

422
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What are you doing?

423
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Wait!

424
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, it's coming!

425
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's coming!

426
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's big!

427
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's coming!

428
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's big!

429
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's big!

430
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The prey has finally arrived. Will Eguchi's determination be enough to tie itself up?

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Stop for a moment.

432
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's big!

433
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No, not like that.

434
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The Elster has been caught!

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Amazing!

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So no one caught anything with this.

437
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's good.

438
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's dramatic.

439
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Taigu is in a good mood and continues to hit.

440
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The loser and the other members also hit repeatedly until the end.

441
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And finally, the time is up.

442
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll tell you a story.

443
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm going to eat.

444
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know if I can win.

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know what to say. I think it's like, whatever you do, you win.

446
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you for your time.

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The winner is...

448
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The result is...

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
How about you, old man?

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't think I can win.

451
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, really?

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Is this enough?

453
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Here it is.

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is amazing.

455
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm not going to do that.

456
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's not good.

457
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yamanashi-san is...

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
21.

459
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
22.

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
22 points!

461
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Eguchi-kun.

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Eguchi-san.

463
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Eguchi-kun, you should try it.

464
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay.

465
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This is...

466
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
8?

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
8.

468
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's about 8.5.

469
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
8.5.

470
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
8.5?

471
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
8.5.

472
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is going to be 5.

473
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes.

474
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is a little small.

475
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
From there?

476
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That or this?

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's 8, right?

478
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's 8.

479
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What is it?

480
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's huge!

481
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's huge!

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's huge!

483
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is huge.

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's 30!

485
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
30?

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
30!

487
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh!

488
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh!

489
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh!

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hey!

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're so weak!

492
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm not weak!

493
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll try to see through the water.

494
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hurry up!

495
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm begging you!

496
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
2, 2, 25!

497
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh!

498
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
25cm!

499
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't do it!

500
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,020
If you look at the

501
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
big

502
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
big

503
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
big

504
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
big

505
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,020
big

506
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
big

507
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
big

508
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,020
big

509
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
big

510
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,020
big

511
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
big

512
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:04,020
big

513
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
big

514
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
big

515
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Thank you!

516
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Thank you!

517
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
I got the first prize!

518
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
I thought you were lying!

519
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,020
Young lady, you are the 4th Chikichiki Entertainment Contest winner.

520
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
And...

521
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
So cute!

522
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,020
It's the 4th year!

523
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,020
After the election, without reading the surrounding atmosphere,

524
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
without making a big laugh,

525
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
What are you saying?

526
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,020
I hereby declare that the first-year students have achieved excellent results.

527
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,020
On July 1st, the Japanese National Team's producer, Sugai Kenichi.

528
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Thank you!

529
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
This is the number one T-shirt!

530
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Thank you!

531
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
This is a collaboration with everyone.

532
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
This is a trophy.

533
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Thank you!

534
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,020
The prize is a prize for the winner, Hama-chan.

535
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Okudai-san, please take the second T-shirt.

536
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Thank you.

537
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Here you are.

538
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
Number 2 T-shirt.

539
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Thank you.

540
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Number 3 T-shirt.

541
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Thank you.

542
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
Number 3.

543
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Eguchi-san, 25.5 cm.

544
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
Number 3 T-shirt.

545
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Thank you.

546
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
Number 4 T-shirt.

547
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Thank you.

548
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Number 4 T-shirt.

549
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
I got 4.5 cm before.

550
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
Thank you.

551
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,020
And the winner is No.5.

552
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
No.5.

553
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,020
And the last one is 22cm.

554
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
It's a human t-shirt.

555
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
It's a human t-shirt.

556
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Why are you wearing this?

557
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
It's a human t-shirt.

558
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
It's a human t-shirt.

559
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Please watch the video.

560
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
It's a high-class video.

561
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Thank you.

562
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
I think the real hammer is better.

563
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,020
I'll send you this.

564
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,020
I'll be doing this for a couple of days in the fall, so please look forward to it.

565
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:36,020
I was 2nd place, so I'll start again from 4th place.

566
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
4th, 4th, 3rd place.

567
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
I'm a little bit higher than them.

568
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Next time, I'll be in 2nd place and then 1st place.

569
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Thank you for your hard work.

570
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Please continue to support me.

571
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
I'm really frustrated.

572
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I feel like I don't want to be in the top 3.

573
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,020
I feel like I don't want to be in the top 3.

574
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
That's all I want to think about.

575
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Thank you very much.

576
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,020
So, today's victory was a natural victory.

577
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
I can't beat him.

578
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm a TV show host, Tsurijiman.

579
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
I'll come anytime.
