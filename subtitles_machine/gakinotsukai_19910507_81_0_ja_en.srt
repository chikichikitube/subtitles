00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
F1 Grand Prix in Tokyo

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
F1 Grand Prix in Tokyo

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to have an F1 Grand Prix

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We are going to have a race with our cars

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why did you find out?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Everyone knows

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is an antique car

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is a Nissan Impala 630R

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have owned this car for 5 years

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You must have a lot of money

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What is that shop?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is a monster exotic car

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It has a lot of energy

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you want to take a look at the engine room?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't want to

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There is a Ume-kichi inside

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
F1 Grand Prix in Tokyo

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is Mr. Kenji Suga

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What is this car?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is a 1975 911

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Excuse me, I can't look at the camera

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are not an amateur

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How many years have you been eating?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is a 1974 Carrera

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is a 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How is it?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's good, but I'm not good at driving

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are not good at driving?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The staff is going to bite you

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm Ume

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How many kilometers have you driven so far?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The fastest is 220 km

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where do you live?

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I live in Setagaya

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is the nearest police station?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tamagawa Police Station

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How many kilometers have you driven so far?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
80 km

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is a RX-7

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I like your car

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I like your car

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyone, talk

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Open the door when the weather is nice

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't open the door

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is a Nissan Safari

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I heard that you dug a hole on your way home from skydiving

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Did you dig a hole with me?

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The place where the tissue is placed in front of the car is an industrial area

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It can be used immediately

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What is this?

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is a Hilux Surf

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You don't care about this car?

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is this?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You don't joke with me, do you?

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I heard that you dug a hole on your way home from skydiving

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A hole?

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I see

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you want me to write that you don't joke with me?

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is a Takasu

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Takasu

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Stop

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a Takasu

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Take this

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Take this

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hold this

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What is this?

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it funny?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I didn't expect this

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I see

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is a Norias

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is a Aisa

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is a Met-In-Tact

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can fix your helmet here

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Like this

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You came all the way here

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have too much knowledge

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No one can fix a helmet like this

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Even if you lose a helmet like this

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the same as covering a ugly woman

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Shall we start?

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Everyone is standing in front of the car

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Run

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Get on

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The goal is the line in front of you

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Run as far as you can

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The winner will win

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Be careful not to get wet

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Be careful not to slip

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm afraid of hydroplaning

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't joke with me

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The reason why I don't joke with you is because of this rule

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ready

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I made a mistake

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I turned on the radio

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was my favorite song

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mr. Matsumoto

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The winner is Mr. Yanaoka

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's see the winning run again

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm glad

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mr. Yanaoka

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Congratulations

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Can I express my feelings with my attitude now?

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's been a while since I came to Asakusa

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's been a while since you came to this company

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think it's rare for a star like you to come to Asakusa.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You still haven't said it?

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I thought I'd have to talk about this today.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I really don't know what to say.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The other day, I was with a local friend in Aokawa.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I said, I'm going now. I was pretty happy.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In the middle of the night?

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In the middle of the night. It was about 1.30 or so.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was late, but I thought I'd have a cup of tea.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I went down to the house, and I got a call.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
From your friend?

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He said, come out.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I went.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I called him the other day.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I found out later how old he was.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A 16-year-old woman,

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
in the middle of the night,

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
holding a plastic bag,

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
she was walking towards me.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What was that?

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Was she having an affair?

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
At first, I thought she was eating something.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She was eating one by one.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I called her, and I fell asleep.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
At that time, I was completely shocked.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Whoa!

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Tea!

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's tea!

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I said.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't believe it's so late at night.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You don't know that.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Of course I don't.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What am I doing at this time of the night?

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I shouldn't be doing that.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My parents, too,

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
have been working to raise young boys.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're just an old lady in green.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When I was in elementary school,

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was sent to your aunt's house,

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and then I was sent to your uncle's house.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're just an old lady in green.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I said,

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you shouldn't be doing that.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go home.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go home.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I said that.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I called her,

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and she said,

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm home.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I said, okay, I'll be right there.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When I looked at her,

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
she was in my car.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're lucky.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Lucky?

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're lucky.

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you saw me like that,

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
what would you think of me?

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's true, but...

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What are you doing?

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's not good.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Go home.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I said that.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll ask you later.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Go home.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Go home.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I said, okay, okay.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I called her,

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and she said,

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
my friend came.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I looked at the passenger seat.

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What happened?

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That woman said,

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
she's my girlfriend.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't lie to me.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You just met me.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why am I your girlfriend?

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She said,

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
she's my girlfriend.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You brought her here.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
She's my friend from elementary school.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't believe what I say,

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
or what other people say.

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What did you do after that?

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I said,

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
just throw away

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that dangerous thing

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you're holding in your hand.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not dangerous at all.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I said,

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
just throw it away.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you really say that?

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Of course.

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I threw it away.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did you take her with you?

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No.

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I said,

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
go home.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Go home.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I said,

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I won't go home.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I said,

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
take me somewhere.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Come on.

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I said,

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't want to.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't want to?

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
She's 16.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
She's your strike zone.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She's in the middle,

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
if you say that.

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Even if she's a local from Tokyo,

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
in front of the TV,

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
you say,

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I did it.

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No,

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I said,

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I did it.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I said,

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't think so.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I said,

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
did you do it?

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Question.

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm asking you.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Did you do it?

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I did it.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I said,

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I did it.

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
For example,

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
if the police say,

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
what are you doing there?

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They probably won't believe me,

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
if I say that.

257
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I wonder.

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's...

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't get away with that.

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What do you mean?

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If they don't believe you,

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you're doing what you're doing.

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's right.

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm doing something.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They'll think I'm a accomplice.

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In the drama,

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
when I open the door,

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
no one comes out.

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The door was open,

270
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
so when I went in,

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was hit by a vase,

272
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
my head was broken,

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and I died.

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When I was about to die,

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the woman next door,

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
said,

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm going to kill you.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's exactly what happened.

279
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What are you going to do?

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm going to run away.

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can't run away.

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Even if I run away,

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't remember her face.

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
In that case,

285
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have to kill her.

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's what I say.

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When I go to her place,

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
she makes this face.

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to kill you.

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't remember her face.

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When I ran away,

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
she made a normal face.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's nonsense.

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Normally,

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
including that,

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you have to be trustworthy.

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can't trust anyone.

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Normally,

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you have to be trustworthy.

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's a good opportunity.

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's right.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I was shocked when she said,

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm more trustworthy than her.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I got an energy shock.

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Normally,

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
on TV,

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
people make fun of me.

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm lying to myself.

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have to be trustworthy.

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't help it.

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can't use lies.

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have to be trustworthy.

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's a joke.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's a real story.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know anything.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You stole your gasoline.

317
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's a joke.

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't believe you.

319
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's a joke.

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I didn't steal gasoline.

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, my!

322
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Sorry, Maria!

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Sorry, Maria.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Did you steal it?

325
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, no, no.

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I stole it.

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, well, well, well.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't help stealing other people's things.

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I really shouldn't do that.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm not bragging, but I've never stolen anything.

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is funny.

332
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So, what did I steal?

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
First, you went to your housemate's house on New Year's and stole all the New Year's presents.

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You stole it, didn't you?

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Um...

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You stole it, didn't you?

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's good?

338
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You stole it, didn't you?

339
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't push me!

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I thought you were going to come in.

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You hid it, didn't you?

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You stole it, didn't you?

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's all.

344
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What?

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You might have stolen it with you, but I'll return it the next day.

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you serious?

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm serious.

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Are you serious?

349
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm serious.

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I've been told this by my mother all the time.

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I've been told this by my mother all the time.

352
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I've been told this by my mother all the time.

353
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I shouldn't touch other people's things.

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Even if I touch other people's things, I should return them twice as much.

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I've been told this by my mother all the time.

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I've been told this by my mother all the time.

357
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My mother is the one who guides the young men.

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I got it!

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You green lady!

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Didn't you steal the sweets before you went to the New Year's?

361
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I stole them.

362
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What did you steal?

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What?

364
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What did you steal?

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Chocolate and other stuff.

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Poporon and stuff.

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Poporon, ron, ron, poporon, ron.

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's not good.

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You shouldn't steal poporon.

370
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you steal poporon, the next time you're born, you'll be Marimo.

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What about Carl?

372
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't think about stealing Carl.

373
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He's a sea cat.

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What?

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
A sea cat.

376
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sea cats are sad.

377
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He's not even a cat, but he's called a sea cat.

378
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you have any sweets?

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No, I don't.

380
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What the hell are you doing?

381
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What did you steal?

382
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What did I steal?

383
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Potato chips.

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I've had a lot of potato chips.

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why did you steal them?

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not dead yet.

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you're dead, come over here.

388
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Potato chips? What flavor?

389
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't decide what flavor.

390
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's obvious.

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Really?

392
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Potato chips can't be made with Koikeya and Calbee.

393
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's true.

394
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's obvious.

395
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's right.

396
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's true.

397
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What flavor?

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Nori salt.

399
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Nori salt is the heaviest among potato chips.

400
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Please take it out.

401
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Good evening.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What's your name?

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yoshimi Takimura.

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
How old are you?

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
18.

406
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
18?

407
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What's your father's name?

408
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Koji.

409
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What's your mother's name?

410
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Ie.

411
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's your father's name?

412
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Koji.

413
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What's your mother's name?

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ie.

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What's your name?

416
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yoshimi.

417
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you from?

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm Japanese.

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I see.

420
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You know everything about her.

421
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't.

422
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I just heard my father and mother's names.

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I know.

424
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Really?

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll say it instead of her.

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You mean her?

427
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes.

428
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
When was she born?

429
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Koji.

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's your father's name?

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is another interesting thing.

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This kind of thing happens often.

434
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's the question.

435
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you very much.

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you very much.

437
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So...

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's introduce the post today.

439
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I visited Kanda Pansy Hall with my friend and mother.

440
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Until that day, I didn't know which one of us was a fan.

441
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I didn't think about it.

442
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You didn't think about it.

443
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I realized that I was a fan of Hitoshi Matsumoto.

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I went to Matsumoto, who was trying to go home with a pen and notebook.

445
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I thought the staff would say no.

446
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But Matsumoto took the pen and signed it.

447
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
When my mother said thank you, I looked back at Matsumoto's smile.

448
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I can't forget it.

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hey.

450
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Are you a fan of Fujiyama?

451
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He smiled.

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There's another thing like this.

453
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is a cutout from the newspaper.

454
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I received this.

455
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is Shisayo from Aichi Prefecture.

456
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll read the cutout.

457
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was in the newspaper on the weekend.

458
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a famous scene from the 13th.

459
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a famous scene from the 13th.

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's a famous scene from the 13th.

461
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When I saw the last scene of Flanders, Matsumoto said he cried.

462
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But I couldn't help but cry.

463
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It was impressive.

464
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I was moved by this.

465
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Did you come all the way from Sontan?

466
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I thought it would be better for me to be a bit reckless.

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So I changed myself.

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But I could see my true self.

469
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's something you can't hide.

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You can't help but cry.

471
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's very beautiful.

472
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's right.

473
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Have you ever cried for someone?

474
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For someone?

475
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I used to cry a lot when I watched Don't Call Me Papa.

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're talking about such a low-class story.

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You can cry in a drama.

478
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't Call Me Papa.

479
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're wrong.

480
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're wrong.

481
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Isn't there anything you cry about in your daily life?

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
For example, when you go home and twist the faucet, water comes out.

483
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Ah, the faucet.

484
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Can you cry?

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Can you cry like that?

486
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Can you cry when you go home and twist the faucet and water comes out?

487
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can cry.

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't lie.

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Depending on how much water comes out of the faucet,

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
do you think about how many people work to make water come out?

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you think it's natural for water to come out of the faucet?

492
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're wrong.

493
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You need to think about that.

494
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The person who makes water come out of the faucet is called a faucet man.

495
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He's wearing a red cape.

496
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's a good story.

497
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's a good story.

498
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If it was really a woman.

499
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What?

500
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If the faucet man was a woman,

501
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
wearing a red cape,

502
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I would be grateful.

503
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I wouldn't cry.

504
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I would cry.

505
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I've never seen it.

506
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I would cry.

507
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I wouldn't cry.

508
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I've never seen you cry.

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Actually, I don't think it's funny to say this, but I'll say it.

510
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I came to the venue today.

511
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I thought I was going home.

512
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There's no way out.

513
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's the great thing about the faucet man.

514
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was lying.

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The faucet man...

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Please wait a little longer.

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's take a break.

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
People who watch this show are fools.

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If he didn't come, I'd have forgotten.

520
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's not true.

521
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's not true.

522
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's true.

523
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When was it?

524
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Even today's audience was making a stupid face.

525
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's not true.

526
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll tell you a little later.

527
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Please wait a little longer.

528
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's all for now.

529
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
See you next week.

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Goodbye.

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Goodbye.

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't like this part.

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What?

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't like this part.

535
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This part...

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It stinks.

537
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It doesn't stink.

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's a little hard to hear.

539
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There's a dog and a rabbit in the back.

540
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is a present for you.

541
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I see.

542
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Miki Suzuki, 17 years old.

543
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
She's here today.

544
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's give her a present.

545
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Thank you very much.

546
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Here you go.

547
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Here it is.

548
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes.

549
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's on now.

550
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I was going to bring it home and put it on.

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I heard you need electrical work.

552
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a lot more expensive than the general price.

553
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry to say that.

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I have a lot of people I want for the next person.

555
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Do you want to take it home?

556
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll do it.

557
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll do it.

558
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll do it.

559
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll do it.

560
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll do it.

561
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
