00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
High Tension! The Best Ten!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good evening!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's the beginning of the new year!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's the beginning of the new year!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There are a lot of wonderful people here today.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, we're all standing here.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
As a man, I was wondering why you didn't come to say hello.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was wondering why you didn't come to say hello.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I was wondering why you didn't come to say hello.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, really?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was wondering why you didn't come to say hello.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, really?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I see.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're such a bad senior.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, let's go.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
High Tension! The Best Ten.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
First, the 10th place is...

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
50 points!

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Spartandy! Kogoriko! Tanaka Naoki!

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
High Tension! The Best Ten.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, no, thank you, thank you.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, Tanaka-san.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good evening.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Spartandy.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, I wanted to cut off your education.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's why I'm giving you this title.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you doing it?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, the grammar is a bit...

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, Tanaka-san, can I ask you a question?

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, yes.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Ota Daisuke from Chiba Prefecture.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm in my third year of elementary school.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I love baseball since I was in elementary school.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I always play baseball with my classmates.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But no matter how many times I played, I couldn't hit the ball.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everyone made fun of me and I cried a lot.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
At that time, when I saw Tanaka-san's high tension on TV, I got a lot of courage.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The next day, I was able to hit a home run.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, how should I put it?

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm aiming for the small kids.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, I'd be very happy if you could give me such an opinion.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're such an idiot.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, shall we start today?

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, in this way...

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm aiming for the kids.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sure you can hit a home run with such high tension.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, let's get started.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, time is running out.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's get started.

Well, Mr. Koala.

Do you like alcohol?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, I do.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is the famous sake from Niigata Prefecture.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's called Koshinobairu.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is very valuable.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is...

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you like alcohol.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Can I drink this?

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please drink it.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
One more.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
One more.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm getting excited.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can do it.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can do it.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000

As expected, it's 9th place.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's amazing.

It's 8th place.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a little different from the previous two.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a little different from the previous two.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Miyasako-san, did you get married recently?

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How is your marriage?

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My wife's body is so soft.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000

I'm Gokuraku Tonbo's client.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Actually, the two of you can't come to the studio today because of work.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're shooting a VTR in advance.

Osaru-san, before you go to the high tension

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're good at the violin

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But the next high tension is more wonderful

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But the next high tension is more wonderful

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll do my best

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll do my best

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm a very young man

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm a very young man

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm a very young man

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This week's 5th place is...

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The lonely battle of Osaru

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It was good because of the rhythm and tempo

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was good because of the rhythm and tempo

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It was good

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This week's 4th place is...

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
6th place

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hodohara

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hodohara-san, you don't have to go behind

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
4th place

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
4th place

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
359 points

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
359 points

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is unexpected

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Please take a rest

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Please take a rest

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's very quiet

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's very quiet

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm looking forward to the high tension

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm looking forward to the high tension

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This week's 4th place is...

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This week's 4th place is...

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Tai

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Tai

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Tai

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Tai

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Tai

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It was quick

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was quick

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was interesting

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It was interesting

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's difficult to get into the top

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's difficult to get into the top

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you become a 4 member group, you will be able to do it

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If you become a 4 member group, you will be able to do it

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This week's spot light

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This week's spot light

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This week's spot light

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This week's spot light

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thank you

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He hasn't been favored by many people

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He hasn't been favored by many people

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He was always in a side-side position

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He was always in a side-side position

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's been a while

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I thought a lot about the costume

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I thought it would be a big hit

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I thought it would be a big hit

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The moment I came out, I...

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The moment I came out, I...

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What to say...

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Your face was about to cry

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Really?

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So this was a trick?

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was a trick.

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I didn't know that.

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You're treating me like a spotlight.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please leave the spotlight to me.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll do something that will surprise you.

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's another one?

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There's another one.

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll do something that will surprise you.

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll do something that will surprise you.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can't speak.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then, the third one.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why are you so relaxed?

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know.

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's like I'm ranked higher.

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's like I'm thinking of money.

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's start.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This week's spotlight goes to...

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mr. Yamasaki, who ranked 18th.

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It goes to...

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Planet Race DiCaprio.

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, you!

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hey, you!

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey, you!

280
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hey, you!

281
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hey, you!

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hey, you!

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hey, you!

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, you!

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey, you!

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey, you!

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey, you!

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hey, you!

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, you!

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hey, you!

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you very much.

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Now, this one is ranked 18th.

293
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This one is ranked 18th.

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
10th is a common number.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
18th is a common number.

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now, the last one is ranked 3rd.

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Now, the last one is ranked 3rd.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's start.

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This week's 3rd place goes to...

300
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
375,000.

301
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
375,000.

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Human Genetic Power.

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Water Torque.

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have to do three jobs for water.

307
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's not possible.

308
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's not possible.

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't come to the studio.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't come to the studio.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's not possible.

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We'll watch it on VTR.

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Excuse me, Mr. Hamada.

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Mr. Hamada,

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Mr. Hamada,

316
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Mr. Hamada,

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Mr. Hamada,

318
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mr. Hamada,

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Mr. Hamada,

320
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Mr. Hamada,

321
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Mr. Hamada,

322
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr. Hamada,

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Mr. Hamada,

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mr. Hamada,

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Mr. Hamada?

326
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mr. Hamada?

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How are you?

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
How are you?

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Help me!

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Help me!

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Help me!

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because you don't have time,

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We'll join you.

334
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's go!

335
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is this 3rd place?

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think it's wonderful

337
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is it wonderful?

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I understand

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's go! This week's 2nd place is...

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
418 points

341
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hello, Kogoriko-san! Fujii Takashi!

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hello, Fujii-san!

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hello!

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's fun, so it can't be helped

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's right, Viva Jinsei!

346
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Speaking of Fujii-san, I'm Yoshimoto Shinki

347
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I received a telegram from a friend

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

349
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If I slip, I'll go back to Osaka

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Suenari Yumi-san

351
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yadayumi-neesan

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's go to 3rd place

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't know about the tension, but let's go!

355
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This week's 2nd place is Fujii Takashi

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hello, Kogoriko-san!

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
1, 2, 3, 4!

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I walked looking for Kogoriko

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Left and right, left and right

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm glad to have met you here

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're happy and embarrassed

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm happy to have met you here

363
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
One part of my body

364
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Looking at his face

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think that's enough

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Thank you very much!

367
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is wonderful

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's go!

369
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This week's No.1 is...

370
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This week's No.1 is...

371
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No.42

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ai! Hohohohoi!

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Kogoriko! Endo! Shozo!

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You...

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can't do that!

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can't do that!

377
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You have too much fat in your body!

378
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's completely different from when you're naked!

379
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Really?

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're so fat!

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You have a different face today!

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Really?

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're so manly!

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Your eyebrows are so thick!

385
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's hard to do it like this!

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Just the face! If you pull it back a little...

387
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Look! It's so hard!

388
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Excuse me!

389
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No.1 is...

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Ai! Hohohohoi!

391
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let's go!

392
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This week's No.1 is...

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Do you know the samba rhythm?

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you know the samba rhythm?

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you know the samba rhythm?

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank you very much!

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That was amazing!

398
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Endo-san!

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Endo-san!

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
As expected, you're No.1!

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That was great!

402
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The last move was good too!

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
To be honest, I don't know what to say from the perspective of the host...

404
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I can't shake No.1 for a while!

405
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's go!

406
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Ai! Hohohohoi!

407
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Like this?

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Endo-san!

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is...

411
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is inevitable!

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This is no good!

413
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This is no good!

414
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Why are you like this?

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is inevitable!

416
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
In this show

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Sometimes a talent comes

418
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And you suddenly understand it when you're talking

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I was there then

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You were there then

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You were there then

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You were there then

423
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You were there then

424
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You were there then

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You were there then

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I felt like you were telling me to come up

427
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I felt like you were telling me to come up

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Spice Girls?

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You scared me!

430
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Please give a song to Spice Girls and Mariah Carey

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes

432
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm very sorry but...

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I heard Spice Girls are very popular

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Who is that?

435
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're doing a music program and you don't know Spice Girls?

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What is Spice Girls?

438
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's amazing

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I heard there are tens of millions of songs

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Really?

441
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I heard there are 9 million songs

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What are you talking about?

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know

444
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There are 90 million songs

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
90 million songs

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't you think it's amazing?

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Amazing

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You're such a snob

449
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Come here

450
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You're so lazy

451
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't care

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
When are you going to get up?

453
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Get up

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm very sorry but...

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes?

456
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm already bored of the talk show

457
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's how popular it is

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm thinking of a new talk show with a new sound

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But it's true that I'm bored

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You too?

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Please give me a new one

462
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm already bored

463
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Let's record

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This time

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll sing a summer song

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Summer song?

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll sing a song that makes you feel nostalgic

468
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Please

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I want a stand

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry, stand

471
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm sorry

472
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What are you laughing at?

473
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't be silly

474
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll sing a song that makes you feel nostalgic

476
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll sing a song that makes you feel nostalgic

477
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll sing it again and again

478
00:21:35,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's okay

479
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sorry

480
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I was very embarrassed

481
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You've already recorded the chorus, right?

482
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes

483
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll sing

484
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
My stomach is shaking

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
My love is shaking

486
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't sing

487
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I can't sing

488
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I can't sing

489
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I can't sing

490
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I can't sing

491
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I can't sing

492
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I can't sing

493
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's okay

494
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Really?

495
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry

496
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll sing

497
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll sing

498
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
My stomach is shaking

499
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
My love is shaking

500
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm a taxi driver

501
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm a taxi driver

502
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm a taxi driver

503
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm a taxi driver

504
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm a taxi driver

505
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What is a taxi driver?

506
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's an image

507
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's an image

508
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's a taxi driver

509
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I know

I'm a taxi driver

515
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No

516
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll change the part

517
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll change the part

518
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
My stomach is shaking

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
My love is shaking

520
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
