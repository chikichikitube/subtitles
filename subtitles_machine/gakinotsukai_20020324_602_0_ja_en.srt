1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Actually, today, I have a sad announcement to make to all of you who are watching this musical instrument.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have been playing this instrument for the second time since it started.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yamasaki Hosei is going to graduate from this program with this broadcast.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We did something like a prank just a year ago, didn't we?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
After a year, I realized that it was really going to be like that. It was as if I had foreseen it before. I still don't understand it.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, he's a senior to Kokoriko.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He taught me a lot of things that kids can avoid, so I wanted to learn more.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Today's star is Yamasaki Hosei.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As Matsumoto said, I think that the people who are watching the TV right now are probably surprised to hear that you are graduating from this program.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is the reason?

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He said it was the end of the program.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I see. What is the reason for the end of the program? I hope you can tell that to the people who are watching the TV.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's been 14 years since I started being an entertainer.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My wife, Aya, and I have been talking about various things.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My wife is very anxious. She's worried that I won't be able to use her.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I heard that she was very anxious.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She's very anxious.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She's very anxious.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So you're not going to quit?

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, I'm not going to quit.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not going to quit.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's going to be a little long, but is it okay?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I heard that your senior, Mr. Kiyashino, finished eight regular programs this spring.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I was very jealous.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why?

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because he was very slim.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't have to quit.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's why I don't feel like the story is ending halfway.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, let's start from here.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, it's okay.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't like this kind of thing.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Have fun.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is the best five that he chose.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's take a look at it.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, please.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hosei Yamasaki, 34 years old.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's been 12 years since we spent time with you.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've been on the show for 12 years, and you've given us a lot of laughter and excitement.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is the season when cherry blossoms fall.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hosei Yamasaki, the master of children.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Fifth place, Hosei Yamasaki vs. Oonishi Jimmy.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There was a person who was said to be your enemy.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes, it's Oonishi Jimmy, Yoshimoto's senior.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They always quarrel when they meet.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The two of them are now nostalgic memories.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Stop it, stop it.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't drink this.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why did you kick me?

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did you kick me?

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why did you kick me?

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was breathing.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why did you kick me?

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're already a middle school kid.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Stop it, stop it.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're a middle school kid, so you have to drink like this.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're a middle school kid.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're a middle school kid, so you have to drink like this.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Stop it, stop it.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Stop it.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fourth place, Hosei Yamasaki goes back to his hometown.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
When I went to the apartment, it was like this.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing?

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
When we saw you changed, we couldn't hide the same color.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We all went to the mountains to return you.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you surprised?

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You bastard.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What are you doing?

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you doing?

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're a coward now.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're a coward now.

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're a coward now.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're a coward now.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What are you doing?

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What are you doing?

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you doing?

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You bastard.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Third place, Goodbye Hosei Yamasaki.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was really surprised when I heard that you were going to quit the program a few years ago.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But this was a prank on you who likes pranks.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yamagawa.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I won't stop using kids.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What did you say?

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I won't stop, I won't stop, I won't stop.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Never.

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Parfait is a rabbit.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Do you know how much you look like a rabbit?

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think it's my chance now.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Look at the other side.

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yamagawa, you're amazing.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
2nd place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You had another opponent, right?

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes, it's Moriman, who has won many famous matches

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In the end, he couldn't win even once, but he always made us have fun

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
1st place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
1st place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Your sudden marriage announcement really surprised me

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And we all watched your moving wedding ceremony

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:29,000
1st place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a very beautiful video

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Even if you play it in a song, it won't look like this

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No way!

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No way!

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Where did you get this?

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No way!

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
1st place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:29,000
1st place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The laughter and emotions you gave us will be deeply engraved in our hearts

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Goodbye, and thank you for the memories

122
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
1st place, Yamasaki Hosei vs. Moriman

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's 5th place from 1st place that you chose

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Last year, there was a prank

125
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It was a bit ironic

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now, I'd like to say goodbye to the producer, Mr. Suga

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yamaguchi, thank you very much for the past 13 years

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry for saying such rude things on the show

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have very complicated thoughts about having a child next month

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't need anyone I don't need on the show

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't help it

133
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can cut off the circle of using the child

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'd like you to cut off the circle on the Japanese TV

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'd like you to do your best in other songs

136
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you very much

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think Mr. Suga was trying to make you laugh

138
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Please understand that

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is the last time, so let's say goodbye

140
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you very much

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'd like to learn more from you

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is the end of the prank

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
See you next time

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you

145
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's not that I can't see you

146
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thank you for your hard work

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In my case, I can't see you anymore

148
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Please do your best

149
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was a new family

150
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd like you to be friends with my new family

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Finally, I'd like to say goodbye to Mr. Yamasaki

152
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'd like you to say goodbye to Mr. Yamasaki

153
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Here you go

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mr. Yamasaki

155
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Do you think you can get a lot of flowers?

156
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I love you

157
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm thinking about a lot of things

158
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry

159
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know what to say

160
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mr. Yamasaki, do your best

161
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you very much

162
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know what to say

163
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The title of the program was wrong

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know the truth

165
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's over

166
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I heard that he went abroad and became a gay

167
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's be careful

168
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Mr. Yamasaki, don't be a child

169
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Everyone, are you surprised?

170
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I thought I could stop because I did drugs this time

171
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This time, I asked Mr. Kokori and Mr. Yamasaki to do a prank

172
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Mr. Yamasaki, don't be a child

173
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Everyone, are you surprised?

174
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The wind blows and the flowers fall

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Even if you get wet in the rain, the flowers will fall

176
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If it's a blooming flower, it will fall someday

177
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's the love of the same fate

178
00:17:46,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know what to say

179
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Mr. Yamasaki, don't be a child

180
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He asked me to do the same thing last time

181
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to do it again

182
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What is the meaning of this?

183
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Nothing

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What does he want to do?

185
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I want to continue with this and Moriman

186
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm scared

187
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm scared

188
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know if I can stop

189
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I think it's a defense

190
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's go

191
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Mr. Yamasaki is immortal

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll do it again

193
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Before the recording of the talk that ended with the audience

194
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Matsumoto also jumps out of the venue

195
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
For the time being, he returns to the dressing room

196
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Mr. Hamada, are you okay?

197
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The emergency situation that even the elevator will stop

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What is Hamada doing on the 8th floor?

199
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's pitch black

200
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hamada was okay

201
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's been 30 minutes since the power went out

202
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The audience can't hide their anxiety

203
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
At that time, behind the scenes

204
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Lighting is impossible

205
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Lighting is impossible

206
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
This is the only battery

207
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Mr. Yamasaki, please

208
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Mr. Yamasaki

209
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Calm down

210
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's okay

211
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
To reassure the audience

212
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Mr. Yamasaki goes to the stage

213
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyone

214
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The building itself is out of power

215
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I thought everyone was scared

216
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I came with courage

217
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
In a little while, Mr. Downtown will come out

218
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Please wait a little longer

219
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Thank you

220
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry

221
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Mr. Yamasaki

222
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Mr. Yamasaki

223
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Who is this person?

224
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Who is this person?

225
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Who is this person?

226
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The whole area is out of power

227
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
At times like this, the information will go out of control

228
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Please calm down

229
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I came in to see

230
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mr. Hamada was trapped in the elevator

231
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There is no such thing

232
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Mr. Hamada

233
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Where are you going?

234
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Where are you going?

235
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's pitch black

236
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's pitch black

237
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll be surprised if you go down

238
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Why?

239
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well

240
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
An unprecedented event happened

241
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The signal has stopped

242
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The signal has stopped

243
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The monitor is almost pitch black

244
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's almost pitch black

245
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You can't play 30 minutes like this

246
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's right

247
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I recorded the opening

248
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll use it

249
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What?

250
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I can see you

251
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I can't see you on TV

252
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can only talk about scary things

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You were on the 8th floor of the school, right?

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes

255
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You were trapped in the elevator

256
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was on the stairs

257
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
At times like this

258
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Do you know the feeling of being a man?

259
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I was surprised

260
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I was surprised

261
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The window of the school was closed

262
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The window was closed

263
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I don't know why I opened the window

264
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I thought he was going to run away

265
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I thought he was going to die

266
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,400
