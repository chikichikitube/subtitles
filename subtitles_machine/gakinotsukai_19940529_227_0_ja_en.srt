What is that?

151
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
You're talking about money.

152
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
I don't have money.

153
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
It's a loan.

154
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
I did 100 push-ups the other day.

155
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
No, not 100 push-ups.

158
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
I did 100 push-ups.

159
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,740
If it was a long time ago, I would have done this.

160
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
I can do a lot of things.

161
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
You can do a lot of things.

162
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,740
I'm going to get my old self back.

163
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
No, no, no.

164
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,740
You weren't like that back then.

I was.

166
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,740
You always did push-ups.

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
That's why I said I was going to get my old self back.

168
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,740
You're so mean.

169
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,740
I've been doing this for a long time.

170
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Are you drunk?

171
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
No, no, no.

173
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm not drunk.

174
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
I can't do that.

175
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,740
You can't do that?

176
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,740
I'm a cow.

177
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
I'm like a buffalo.

181
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Which one?

182
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740

183
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
No, no, no.

184
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm a buffalo.

185
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Make it clear.

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
I'm a buffalo.

188
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
What's a buffalo?

189
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Are you a horse or a buffalo?

190
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,740
They say I'm a buffalo.

191
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
I don't understand.

192
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,740
I don't care.

193
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
What?

194
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,740
I'm a man who was told that.

195
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
I'll get my old self back.

196
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Please do it.

197
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,740
I think it would be nice if you did it like my body.

198
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
No, no, no.

199
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Try touching it.

200
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
What?

201
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Try touching it.

202
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
It's moving.

203
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,740
You're the one who's been doing this all your life.

204
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
I don't have any chest muscles.

205
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
Touch your chest muscles and you'll have chest muscles.

206
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I don't have any chest muscles.

207
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
I'll do my best.

208
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,740
You have to do your best.

209
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
How is it?

210
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
How is your work?

211
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,740
You're moving with me every day.

212
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
How is it?

213
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm so angry.

214
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,740
I don't understand.

215
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,740
You're lying.

216
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
What are you talking about?

217
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm a comedian and a comedian.

218
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
You're the first one.

219
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
I'm the first one.

220
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,740
I don't understand.

221
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
I don't understand.

222
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm not in the top ranks.

223
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm not in the top ranks.

224
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
I'm not in the top ranks.

225
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
You're lying.

226
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm not in the top ranks.

227
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,740
I should be in the second place.

228
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Your nose is growing.

229
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,740
You're a man.

230
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,740
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
You call me an amateur.

232
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,740
You think I'm stingy.

233
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I don't think so.

234
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,740
I don't want you to believe me.

235
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,740
I'm not stingy.

236
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Your nose is growing again.

237
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Your nose is growing again.

238
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
You're lying.

239
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
You have a mole here.

240
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,740
You have a mole here.

241
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
No.

242
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,740
My nose and my mole are different.

243
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
My nose and my mole are the same.

244
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,740
I can do it if I do something.

245
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
I can't take it off.

246
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
You can take it off.

247
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
I can't take it off.

248
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,740
I can take it off.

249
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Is that so?

250
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,740
I can take it off.

251
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
I can't take it off.

252
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
I can't do that.

253
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Who are you talking to?

254
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
I can't do that.

255
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Why?

256
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,740
I don't care if I'm on TV.

257
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,740
I don't care if I'm on TV.

258
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,740
I don't care if you're on TV.

259
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,740
It's like I'm sticking out my nose.

260
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
That's enough.

261
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,740
Is that so?

262
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,740
It's rude to talk.

263
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,740
What are you doing?

264
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I'm doing it, but I'm being beaten up.

265
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,740
I thought, ah.

266
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Don't do it.

267
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
I won't buy it.

268
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I'm doing it because it's sticking out.

269
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Do it nicely.

270
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Don't put it in.

271
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Don't put it out.

272
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
It's sticking out.

273
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I'm getting a runny nose.

274
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,740
I don't like it.

275
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
What is it?

276
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,740
I'm getting a runny nose.

277
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
It's sticking out.

278
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
It's sticking out.

279
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,740
It's sticking out.

280
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,740
It's sticking out.

281
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
It's sticking out.

282
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
It's shining.

283
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
It's shining.

284
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,740
It's shining.

285
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,740
The audience who comes to see the use of the children here.

286
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,740
What do you usually do?

287
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
I'm working.

288
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
You're a bit of a strange person

289
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
What do you mean?

290
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
You just like to use the kid

291
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740
Ah, I see

292
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Even if you say you like the downtown, it's a bit different

293
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Ah, but you're looking at me with those sparkling eyes

294
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Then when that's over, you'll be like

295
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Ah, this guy is like that!

296
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
That's right!

297
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
This guy is like that!

298
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
He won't break!

299
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,740
He won't even let me get in his car

300
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
I used to be like that when I was in Osaka

301
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
I can't even get in a car

302
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
You're not that old

303
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
That's true

304
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
It's hot

305
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
It's really hot

306
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,740
I'm going to start

307
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
I'm going to start

308
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Hello, Hamada Nii-san and Hitoshi-kun

309
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Hello

310
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I was thinking about this the other day

311
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,740
I want to see your manzai

312
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
But I want to see you two being the opposite

313
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Hamada Nii-san being a joke

314
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
And Hitoshi-kun being a tsukkomi

315
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Ah, I see

316
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
If you think about it like that, it'll be even more interesting

317
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
You see

318
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Hamada-chan's tsukkomi is

319
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
Eh? What is it?

320
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Don't say anything

321
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
Hamada-chan's tsukkomi is

322
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Amazing!

323
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
I'll say that

324
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
I don't do tsukkomi

325
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
But if I do tsukkomi, it's amazing

326
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Are you pretending to be sleeping?

327
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
No, no, no

328
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
No, no, really, really

329
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Let's do it

330
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Can you be a joke?

331
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,740
No, it's okay if it's a yukai joke

332
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
I remember everything

333
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
It's not funny at all

334
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,740
It's just that if there's no mic here, it'll be hard to do it

335
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Give me the mic

336
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
Is there really one?

337
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,740
It's obvious that you're going to do it from the start

338
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,740
I left this for the last episode

339
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Then you come over here

340
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Go on

341
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
That's right

342
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
It's yukai

343
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
It's hard to do it if you don't come out

344
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Shut up

345
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
It's not like that

346
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
Ah, I see

347
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
It's a rough comedy

348
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,740
What are you talking about?

349
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
You've been busy recently, haven't you?

350
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Ah, that's right

351
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,740
Even when you're walking down the street, there are scary things

352
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Ah, that's right

353
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,740
When I'm walking down the street, I take my child with me

354
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
It's scary, isn't it?

355
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I can't stand my parents

356
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
What are you talking about?

357
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Why are you so nervous?

358
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
You're talking very fluently

359
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Really?

360
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
Ah, is that so?

361
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,740
When I'm walking down the street, I take my child with me

362
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
I take my child with me to a stranger

363
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
I'll call him later

364
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I'll call him later

365
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I'll call him later

366
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Hello?

367
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Hello?

368
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Are you kidding me?

369
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Hello?

370
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
Hello?

371
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Where are you?

372
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Yes

373
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Do you have a 3rd grader son?

374
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Yes, I do

375
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
I have a 6th grader son

376
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

377
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

378
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,740
I'm counting on you

379
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
What is it?

380
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
What is it?

381
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
Why are you so desperate?

382
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Why is it like this?

383
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Hello?

384
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Hello?

385
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
How many do you want?

386
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Let's see

387
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
5 million

388
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
5 million?

389
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Is it expensive?

390
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,740
No, is it 5 million?

391
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Is it expensive?

392
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,740
No, is it 5 million?

393
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
Is it expensive?

394
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
No, is it 5 million?

395
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
That's enough

396
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,740
What is that?

397
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,740
What are you?

398
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
What's with that attitude?

399
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Am I slow?

400
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
You're slow

401
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Am I slow?

402
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Listen

403
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
I'll tell you now, so bring it to me

404
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Yes

405
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
I'll tell you

406
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Yes

407
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,740
I'll put 500 million in a green bag and write it in a black bag with yellow paper

408
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,740
If you leave it in a red bag, I'll go get it in a white bag

409
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,740
You're slow

410
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,740
You're slow

411
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
You're slow

412
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,740
How many times do I have to tell you?

413
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,740
No, no, no

414
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,740
It's hard to kidnap people

415
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
Which one is better?

416
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,740
If it's like that, it's easier for the doctor to do it

417
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Doctor

418
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Let's remember it here

419
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
I completely remembered

420
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,740
I see

421
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,740
You're a doctor, you're a doctor

422
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Doctor

423
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
I'm Masao's father

424
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
That's right

425
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
You came the other day

426
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Yes

427
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
I took a photo of the Lendogen

428
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
That's right

429
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,740
I received it

430
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,740
What kind of comment is this?

431
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
It's been a long time

432
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
It's been a long time

433
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
It's not the first time

434
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
I see

435
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
Masao's father

436
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,740
That's right

437
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
You came the other day

438
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
I took a photo of the Lendogen

439
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
That's right

440
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,740
I received a photo of it

441
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,740
I took about 200,000 photos

442
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,740
I sold the number and put it up in the hallway

443
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,740
If you have a number you want, you can tell me

444
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,740
I'll show you one

445
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
This

446
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,740
This is Masao's because he's a soldier

447
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,740
From far away

448
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
There are too many clouds, I don't know what's going on

449
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
I'll explain

450
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,740
The lungs are like this

451
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,740
From here, it's like this

452
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,740
I thought it would be like this

453
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,740
It was more like this than I thought

454
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
I thought I'd say it quickly

455
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
Everyone said it

456
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
Thank you very much

457
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,740
You're annoying

458
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,740
That's all

459
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,740
There's only one line

460
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,740
What were you doing in the car?

461
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
There's a baseball story

462
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
Director

463
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm going to quit baseball

464
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
Okay, quit it

465
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
I'm the director

466
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
Okay, quit it

467
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
You can't

468
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Why?

469
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
You have to stop me

470
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Stop me?

471
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,740
If you don't stop me

472
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,740
In my dad's pajamas

473
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Who are you talking about?

474
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
I'm not asking you to stop me

475
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Why are you wearing your dad's pajamas?

476
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
If you don't stop me

477
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
That's right

478
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Director

479
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm going to quit baseball

480
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Okay, quit it

481
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
What is that?

482
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
You can't

483
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
You have to stop me

484
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
In my dad's pajamas

485
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
Why are you wearing your dad's pajamas?

486
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Why are you wearing your dad's pajamas?

487
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,740
I wonder if I can get in the car

488
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Please show me

489
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,740
Camera

490
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
There are so many people waiting

491
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Have you been waiting this long?

492
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
You should have told me

493
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:46,740
This program was brought to you by these sponsors
