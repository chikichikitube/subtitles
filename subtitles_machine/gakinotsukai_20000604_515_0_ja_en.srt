1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
BAM-BARA!

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,480
Don't...don't...don't fall in love with me!

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,780
BAM-BARA!

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,400
I...I want to go...I want to go answer for our mother hands...

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,000
BAM-BARA!

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be the wind!

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, this is a new version.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hanatan's earring.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think it's very complete.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm thinking of making a CD of this kind of thing.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's called the flower song series.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I think it would be nice if it was a flower song.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, that's right.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's a lyrics.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, that's right.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, I don't want to be told by such a crazy guy.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Really, it's the beginning of the winter.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's already raining.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm shivering.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's refreshing in half an hour.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you see.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What do you want to say?

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, no, I was embarrassed the other day.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
At the time of the drama.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a pretty serious scene.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There are times when you can't read the kanji, right?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a little bit like this.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's about looking it up before you go to the scene.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I just happened to read it.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When I saw the next scene, there were surprisingly a lot of lines.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was a pretty serious scene.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I couldn't read the kanji.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In between the eyebrows.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I couldn't read it.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not a comedy scene.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was surprised.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's over when I heard it.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's called a crotch.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The core of the crotch is completely different.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You should have played the game with your crotch.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was really embarrassed.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's nothing to do with a crotch.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is the core of the crotch.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I didn't mean to make you laugh.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's a serious scene.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's a serious scene.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The scene is frozen.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What happened to everyone?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Everyone was surprised.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What is this guy?

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is no good.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't need this kind of crotch.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Say that.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I didn't mean to make you laugh.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was really embarrassed.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's no good.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was embarrassed because I couldn't read the kanji.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't know why I couldn't read the kanji.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was embarrassed.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I didn't know why I couldn't read the kanji.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I put my crotch on my crotch.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I'm a girl.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm a girl.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's not a mistake.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I really don't like it.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's finally over.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The drama is over, right?

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's over.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're going to start next.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's right.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How long will it take for me to end and you to start?

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It depends.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll take off my wings when I'm done.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Really?

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you going to do?

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going crazy.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you going to do?

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to cross the five continents.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're going to cross the five continents?

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're making a mistake with your words.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't say it all the time.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have a lot of things to do.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have a lot of things to do?

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What exactly do you want to do?

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, I want to be a hard gay.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Try it.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Who's a hard gay?

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm going to sue you.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What part of me is a hard gay?

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you have any qualities?

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, I don't.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then what do you want to do?

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But I'm sure there will be more gays in the future.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you talking about?

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've seen a lot of gays in the city.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Really?

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Listen to my theory.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If there is no war, there will be more gays.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What do you mean?

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
After the war, there will be 50 years of war.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
War may not have been a good thing.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But there was a war.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It was a time when men were strong.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Women were protected by men.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a complicated story that men protect women.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not a story to listen to like that.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You have to be a little more aggressive.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You have to be a little more aggressive.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come on.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're like a waterfall.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think so.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When the war is over, women will become stronger.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Men can't emphasize that they are men.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Then the relationship between men and women is reversed.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Women are getting stronger.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Men are getting weaker.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When men are all weak, they are looking for weak people.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When men are weak, the love between men begins.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why is that?

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's where the hard gays come in.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There are a lot of hard gays.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When I went to Shibuya the other day, I saw a lot of hard gays.

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What do you mean by hard gays?

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do you mean by hard gays?

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll tell you how to distinguish hard gays.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
First of all, it's a tank top.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's a great tank top.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's not all tank tops.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a tank top.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
When I saw a man wearing a tank top, I thought it was a hard gay.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And he's bald.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He's got a lot of skin on his head.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought it was a hard gay.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And he's got a big ass.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know if he's got a big ass.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If you look closely, you'll see.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He's got a big ass.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He's got a big ass.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He's got a big ass.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's got a big ass.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where are you going?

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There's a thing called city noise in the hard gay world.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you listen with your ears focused, you'll be breathing like this.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're an idiot.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's how hard gays are.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's what's been going on lately.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a lot.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's what's happened.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not like I'm going to do anything.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know about that.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know if you're being targeted.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know if there's a hard gay right next to you.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's why I'm saying it's different.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Stop it, you idiot.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to run with the boss.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't like running.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to run with the boss.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't like running, but I'm going to run with the boss.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why are we talking about this?

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You started it.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It doesn't matter if you break it.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know about that.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why?

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know if you're being targeted.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you're being targeted by five people, there's nothing you can do.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then you should say it.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What do you mean by saying it?

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't hide it from me.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He got killed.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's what I mean.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can cry.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know if you're being targeted.

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm not going to say it.

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're talking like this.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's the way it is.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're going to run, right?

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you're talking like this and I'm like, what?

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to say it.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You said, go.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to say it.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, no, no. That's fine.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, really. I'm sorry about this.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No, no, no.

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Now, shall we go home?

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I wrote it down.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Is it okay?

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's a hard game.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I stuck it in.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When I stuck it in, it was 5.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
When Matsumoto-san was in the Amagasaki era,

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I heard that you once grabbed the flower of heaven.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How did you feel about it?

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I haven't talked about this before, have I?

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I did say that I saw a kappa.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I did say that I saw a kappa.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I did say that I saw a kappa.

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I didn't grab the flower of heaven.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I didn't say that either.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why? Why can't you say something so amazing?

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's been about 10 years since it started.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's okay to say it first.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's right.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But if you don't listen to me, I can't say it.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Who would believe that I suddenly came out and grabbed the flower of heaven?

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Did you just fart?

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's okay.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll just fart.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Fart?

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I've even been on the Asahi News.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The Asahi News?

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You must be lying.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school,

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I grabbed the flower of heaven.

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The flower of heaven?

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's amazing.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're treating that as one-sided.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It came out.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't know if anyone has it, but I looked it up.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, so I was about 10 years old.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Where? Where did you see it?

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
On a long-distance trip.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
A long-distance trip?

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A long-distance trip.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
A long-distance trip? I didn't go on a long-distance trip either.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, you did.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We were in the same fourth grade.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What do you mean by the same fourth grade?

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a bit double.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's double!

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's four times more.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, you did.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
At that time, I got lost on a long-distance trip.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
At that time, something like that happened.

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A mountain-like place?

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A mountain-like place.

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wakakusayama.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Wakakusayama?

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's a place full of grass.

249
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There's no place to hide.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's Wakakusayama in Nara.

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There's no place to hide.

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I was asked if there was a place to hide.

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You saw it, didn't you?

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I saw it.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What kind of situation was it?

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was raining heavily.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, yes.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It was raining heavily, and I got lost.

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was walking down the mountain path.

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You were walking down the mountain path.

261
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I fell down.

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
At that time, I grabbed something.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
When you slipped, your hand suddenly...

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I grabbed my hand suddenly.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was just a stick.

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't think anyone would say it hurts.

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's your way of running.

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you grab a stick, you'll know I slipped.

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I grabbed my hand suddenly.

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I thought it was a stick.

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was walking down the mountain path again.

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Suddenly, something hit my head.

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Suddenly, something hit my head.

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I was surprised.

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was just a branch.

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you understand the second time?

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think there's a second time.

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
When did you grab it?

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It wasn't the second time.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
My stomach started to hurt.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
My stomach suddenly started to hurt.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I felt like I was going to puke.

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You felt like you were going to puke.

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, I felt like I was going to puke.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I ran and grabbed the stick.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't have any tissue paper.

287
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I grabbed a leaf or something.

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I grabbed a leaf or something.

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I grabbed a leaf or something.

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I grabbed a leaf or something.

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It was a leaf.

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You knew it was a leaf?

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I knew it was a leaf.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I knew it was a leaf.

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It was the third time.

296
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Then can you do it again?

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I knew it was a leaf.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I knew it was a leaf.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Please touch it again.

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Please touch it again.

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I grabbed a leaf.

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I grabbed a leaf.

303
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was going to puke.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I found something that hit my head.

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I thought it was a stick.

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then, here...

307
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's a bit too much!

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's too much!

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's too much for a video!

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's why you can't touch it in front of it!

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What are you trying to do?

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Is this how you do it?

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
From the back of the mouth...

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's why, leave it to me!

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're the one who's going to say,

316
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm definitely going to do it!

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is weird!

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Then, why don't you just walk out of the room?

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're the one who's going to do it!

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can't do it!

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's you!

322
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's my memory, and I'm the one who's going to talk!

323
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're the one who's going to say it from the side!

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Isn't that weird?

325
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Isn't that weird?

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Then, I can't do it here!

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I can't do it here!

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's weird!

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's not here!

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's not here!

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not here!

332
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's not here!

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's embarrassing!

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's embarrassing!

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Right?

336
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're so stupid!

337
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I thought no one would see it!

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're laughing like, what?

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm stupid!

340
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Wait a minute!

341
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're clearly stupid!

342
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You said that?

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I said that!

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's someone who said that!

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Who is it?!

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you say that, this is already a heaven!

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's a heaven!

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Wait!

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm chasing after a heaven!

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why?

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You weren't scared?

352
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I wasn't scared!

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because I was angry!

354
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
People were laughing at me!

355
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I see!

356
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Right!

357
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I said, wait!

358
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I chased after it!

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A heaven like this, huh?

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I wonder if I can catch it?

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You didn't even touch it!

362
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No, no, no!

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Even a heaven is stupid!

364
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I should have run away like this!

365
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I wonder if I can catch it?

366
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I looked at it like this!

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I caught it right away!

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let go!

369
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's amazing!

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's amazing!

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If it's like that, I won't let go!

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let go!

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let go!

374
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, I won't let go!

375
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a fight!

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a fight!

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That was hard!

378
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's pretty long!

379
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What's long?

380
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The nose!

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's going to grow!

382
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It won't grow, right?

383
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's going to grow!

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you pull it like this!

385
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Really?

386
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Really?

387
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's going to grow?

388
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Then...

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It won't grow that much!

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It won't grow that much?

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's a little longer than I thought!

392
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can tell the difference!

393
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Probably!

394
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then!

395
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I said, wait!

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I can make it a dog!

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When I was young...

398
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
When I was young, I was doing stewardess, Mr. Matsumoto.

399
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I heard that stewardess is trained when she's attacked by terrorists.

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What kind of training is she doing?

401
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sure she's doing that.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Please tell me how to deal with stewardess.

403
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's right.

404
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Then you're a terrorist.

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, I'm a terrorist.

406
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then I'm that terrorist's subordinate.

407
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Alright!

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You!

409
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You!

410
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You bastard!

411
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're scaring me, boss!

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
A terrorist's countermeasure.

413
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not like you're doing the old manzai.

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If you're a stewardess, you won't be able to see any countermeasures.

415
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I understand.

417
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes.

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What should I do?

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll show you my Udon Desu Kai.

421
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll show it to the audience.

422
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I see.

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What do you think, audience?

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is my Udon Desu Kai.

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is my Udon Desu Kai.

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm doing it.

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're doing it.

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're doing it.

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
At that time...

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not motivated.

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can't do it with someone who's not motivated.

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's more about how to deal with it than my acting.

433
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm doing it seriously.

434
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry.

435
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's about people's lives.

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I won't stop.

437
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I won't stop this story.

439
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I can't stop it.

440
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Then, shall we move on?

441
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It can't be helped.

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Please tell us properly.

443
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is it?

444
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How to deal with terrorism.

445
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll tell you later.

446
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I have a question for you, Mr. Matsumoto.

447
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it?

448
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When you go to the hospital when you have a cold,

449
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
do you put a stethoscope on your stomach and listen to it?

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you also put a stethoscope on your back and listen to it?

451
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What is the difference between front and back?

452
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What is the difference between front and back?

453
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I see, I see.

454
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Please tell me.

455
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I have that.

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You don't put it on your stomach, do you?

457
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't you put a stethoscope on your back and listen to it?

458
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But I think it's okay to have one of them.

459
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Not the front and back.

460
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No, no.

461
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't you want to be more sure?

462
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I see.

463
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry to hear the sound of my lungs breathing.

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I think so.

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You try to do this, right?

466
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You do this, so you have to do this again, right?

467
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You should have done this from the beginning.

468
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You should have done this.

469
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Come on!

470
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
As a doctor, you should talk properly.

471
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You should have done this.

472
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You should have done this.

473
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But isn't it too early?

474
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You should have done this.

475
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's fine.

476
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Then I'll go to the bus.

477
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The bus?

478
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm sorry for the distance.

479
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Where?

480
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Where is the picture?

481
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why are you looking back?

482
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Have you ever dried your futon?

483
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, I have.

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Futon.

485
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I do it to kill the mites.

486
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
When I dry this side, the mites run to the back because they don't like the sunlight.

487
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So I have to dry the back side again.

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's the same as that.

489
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
For example, when the wind blows like this.

490
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't want to go to the back, so I run to the back.

491
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's what it means.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So you have to do it quickly.

493
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Old men's doctors do this.

494
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They say, next is the back side.

495
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
At that time, the wind blows again.

496
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, it's the back side.

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Actually, it's like this.

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The wind blows like this.

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Old men's doctors don't do this.

500
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But can you find it?

501
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If the wind blows like this.

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want you to put a lot of soul into it.

503
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The doctor?

504
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The doctor.

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Like this, like this.

506
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay, show me your back side.

507
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If you do that, don't come out.

508
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I know.

509
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, it's moving now.

510
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I know.

511
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I know.

512
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Can I stop?

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Can I stop the page?

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't mind.

515
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't mind that.

516
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll take off my shoes.

517
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Finally, when the terrorists were attacked.

518
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It was the commander's order.

519
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Terrorists.

520
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

521
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They're here.

522
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes.

523
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Usually, they go to the chief or something.

524
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They don't go to the station.

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But we're not three.

526
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
There's no chief role.

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You should be the chief.

528
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hey.

529
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You should have done it right after you got on.

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You should have taken off your makeup.

531
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The chief is doing this.

532
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes, the chief is here.

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What are you doing?

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What are you doing?

535
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm going to New York right now.

536
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm going to New York right now.

537
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Turn back.

538
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Turn back?

539
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You can't do such a stupid thing.

540
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't hit your back.

541
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The more you hit your back, the more your back hurts.

542
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
If you hit your back twice, it hurts twice.

543
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So stop it.

544
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Hey.

545
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What are you?

546
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Turn back.

547
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I have a job to do.

548
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Even if you tell me to turn back, I won't.

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
At that time.

550
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
At that time.

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't do it.

552
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't do it.

553
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Are you Udon?

554
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Hey, you.

555
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Open the door.

556
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Are you Udon?

557
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey, you.

558
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Wait.

559
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Hey, you.

560
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Hey, you.

561
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What are you doing?

562
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Shut up.

563
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This tree is hijacked.

564
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This tree is hijacked?

565
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The life of the king is on our hands.

566
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It doesn't matter.

567
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This tree.

568
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Everyone was looking forward to going to New York.

569
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You can't do such a thing as turning back.

570
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Shut up.

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No.

572
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Return the sword.

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Go over there.

574
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Go over there?

575
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Go over there.

576
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Isn't that strange?

577
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Thank you very much.

578
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
