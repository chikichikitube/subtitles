1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is a little different from usual.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mr. Uraigyou is here.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today is a little more than usual.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today is a special.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are about 20 people more than usual.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It doesn't change at all.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are a lot of people from Tokyo.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
About 5 out of 20 are Filipinos.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's almost the same.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today is an hour.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I can't use the children today.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a special.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If it's a special, I'll use a little more money.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's exactly the same.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It seems that the most expensive thing today is the venue fee here.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It seems to be quite expensive here.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, it's not.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There is only one board.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There are usually three, but today there are four.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There is a special under downtown.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Anyone can make it.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a special.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll tell you this.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's usually at 1 pm on Tuesday nights.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's 40 minutes.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've been told.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's amazing today.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There are a lot of young people here today.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's always a 30-minute program.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you hate about it?

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We have to make this a long-standing manzai.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everyone has a story, right?

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I have to do it at the end.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't react so much.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think it's okay to stop.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's better to put out a young man's manzai.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We have time.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We have time.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's okay.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We don't have a story.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Today is mainly a young man from Osaka.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're here to support you.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's right.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're tired today.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I have a headache.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You have a headache every day.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have a headache every day.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When I was a kid, I ran away from somewhere.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was hit by a car.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've been hit by a truck before.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This guy is amazing.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This guy is serious.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When I was a kid, my father told me to smoke.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
When I cut the curve, it broke down.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The truck slowly backed up on the broken surface.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Goton.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Goton.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Goton.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Goton.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Goton.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Goton.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Goton.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're a bad guy.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I thought I was dead once on a skateboard.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When it was popular in the past.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When it was popular in the past.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I hit my head on the heavy road.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I heard a sound.

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Your head?

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My head. I can hear it.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't like it.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What happened?

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't move.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I heard a sound.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I heard a sound.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Everyone, listen.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I heard a sound.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't tell you what I heard.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I heard it from my head.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't tell you.

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go back to the starting position.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, please.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Seriously.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Today is the opening.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please show me the monitor.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's been a while since I saw you.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can laugh again.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can laugh.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I haven't seen you for a while.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm the manager of Nitta Aso-kun.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Everyone knows about Yoshimoto Kouki.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Everyone knows about Yoshimoto Kouki.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't think many people in Tokyo know about him.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What kind of talent does he have?

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There are many people who say that he played Yoshimoto.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's right.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't think most young people know about him today.

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'd like to explain it to you.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is this?

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yoshimoto Kouki.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yoshimoto Kouki.

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm on it.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is today, June 16th.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
June 16th is now.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's now.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's in the way.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's in the way, so I'll take it.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
First of all, Yoshimoto Kouki.

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There are 50,000 Yoshimoto Kouki talents.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Do you know how many there are?

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There are 50,000 Yoshimoto Kouki talents.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey!

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hey!

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There are about 250 talents.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There are about 250 talents.

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'd like to explain it to you.

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As you all know, there are a lot of talents.

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The top one is...

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yasushi Kiyoshi.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Actually, he's not here.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where is Yasushi going?

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where is Yasushi going?

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yasushi, what's going on?

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What's going on?

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to use the toilet.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yasushi Kiyoshi.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There are a lot of things.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is a big deal.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's a big deal, so it's just...

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you think about the number of years and regular numbers, it will change.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think it's okay to think that there are a lot of Yoshimoto Kouki talents.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yasushi, Kiyoshi, Katsura.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, there are a lot of them.

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There are about 250 talents.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Next,

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will explain it to you.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm going to explain it to you.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think it's about this.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think it's about this.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think it's about this.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's just the number of years and regular numbers.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Just the number of years and regular numbers.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's okay to think that there are a lot of talents.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll explain it to you.

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's like this.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Right?

157
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Ah, ah, ah, no, no.

158
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
And it goes like this.

159
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
It's included in this book, too.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,500
In this book, too.

161
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,000
So, as a senior, Kyo-san is there.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hanshin, Kyojin, Katsura, Bunchin, and so on.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, well, well, that...

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, there's something, isn't there?

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, well, I'll just say it.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like this, look.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You see?

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's there.

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But, well, well, well, well, well.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Isn't it fine?

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's no such thing as that.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Who are you making excuses for?

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know who's watching.

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, well, well, well, it goes like this.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And in this volume, there are a lot of people.

177
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But, well, look.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's do it, shall we?

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This volume, right?

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This volume is also a little bit of a turning point.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Kyo-san is there, but...

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes.

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, well, well, well, well, the time is also the same.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because there's no time.

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, it goes like this.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That sound is good, isn't it?

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right?

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, this is also...

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is all about the business!

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is all about the business!

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can't say that, it's all about the business.

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, well, well, it's fine.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's really just around here.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But, well, well, it's fine.

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's fine.

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's here.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And, well, what changes a little from here is that

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the line extends to the side.

201
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What does this mean?

202
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, there's the Tokyo office, right?

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yoshimoto's office.

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yoshimoto's office.

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And, since it's the Tokyo office,

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
well, well, well, it's here on this line.

207
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a very easy-to-understand story, isn't it?

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right?

209
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's very educational, isn't it?

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think it's very educational.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And, well, Naoko Nozawa is here.

212
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And, well, for some reason, in the Tokyo office,

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
there's this kind of person.

214
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's Marianne.

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Marianne is, well, for some reason, in the Tokyo office.

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is, well, this is the strange thing, isn't it?

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, Hamada-kun, where should I put this?

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is the strange thing.

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You...

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't turn things around like that.

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, what should I do?

222
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, it's the Tokyo office.

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes.

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, what should I do?

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There's nothing, there's nothing.

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is just the present, isn't it?

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know what will happen.

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know what will happen.

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know what will happen.

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But, if you look at it a year later,

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you might not know the difference at all.

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know.

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Right?

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maybe this is, well, okay.

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Uh, she's making a joke by herself.

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What is she doing?

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think I'm a very talented person.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I see.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Koji Imada is in the frame.

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Look at this.

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is Koji Imada.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's in Osaka right now.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you pulling your face like that?

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Wait a minute.

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Where are you looking at?

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Imada, look at the lens.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Imada, look at the lens.

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a lens!

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The lens?

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The lens is the camera.

252
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then where are you looking at?

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Hello.

254
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm a poor man.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm poor, but I don't ever go crazy or go dark.

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you live a bright life, good things will happen to you.

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There's an empty can of coke in here.

259
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
There's some left.

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you, God.

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Good things happened to you, right?

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you for the food.

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Boo!

264
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I thought so, but it was pee inside.

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
There's a pair of long shoes in here.

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's going to be useful.

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let's check the size.

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Perfect.

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Ouch!

271
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I thought so, but it was pee inside.

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I don't take nutrition, so I don't get poisoned.

273
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I have to put on my own shoes.

275
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Here we go.

276
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ouch!

277
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The bug is moving this way.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's take it with us.

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're a good...

280
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's a wild boar over there.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's get rid of it.

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wait, wild boar!

283
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I thought so, but it was pee inside.

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I don't take nutrition, so I don't get poisoned.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But I have something to brag about.

287
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My family is very happy.

288
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We're 15 siblings.

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My eldest son is already 45 years old.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But he's my favorite big brother.

291
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We're home.

292
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm saying this with my mouth.

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm home. How have you been?

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, you're a 4-year-old Hichimi.

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're hiding something.

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Take it out.

297
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a toy.

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't give you money to buy toys.

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What's wrong?

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I see. You stole it from the store.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hichimi, that's a 10,000 yen bill.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hichimi?

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's a 10,000 yen bill.

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's very smart of you.

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're great, Hichimi.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're going to be a great woman.

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Anyway, I have a gift for you.

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a secret.

309
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Actually, I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

310
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I succeeded in stealing the Osudake pot.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Now, the moment of justice begins.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It begins.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's Osudake pot.

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, I'm going to boil the water.

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm nervous.

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Will it come out well?

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It won't come out even if I push it.

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Next, there's not much difference between these two.

319
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You can put them side by side.

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He's a man.

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He has a beautiful face like a comedian.

322
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Wait a minute.

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He's a man.

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't like it.

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm going to be bullied by everyone again.

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's start with the leader group.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What's the leader group?

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't move.

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't move.

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's growing.

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't move.

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The girls are watching.

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Stop it.

334
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Line up.

335
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Line up.

336
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Everyone, line up.

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't hide it.

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't dig a rock.

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's gold.

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It hurts.

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Who is it?

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's dangerous.

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't make me angry.

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is it the leader?

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm going to get angry.

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are you going to do it?

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Are you going to do it?

348
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Damn it.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm getting angry.

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Leader.

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It hurts.

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Damn it.

353
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The leader is strong.

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Damn it.

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't put sand in it.

356
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Damn it.

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm getting angry.

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm going home.

359
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What is it?

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Stop it.

361
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't make me angry.

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What is it?

363
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't like it.

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Why?

365
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why didn't you tell me that you like Hanazawa?

366
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't like it.

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm going to call his house.

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why didn't you tell me?

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I like Hanazawa.

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't laugh.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't hide it.

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't make me angry.

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm going home.

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't make me angry.

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Damn it.

377
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm home.

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What's wrong?

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What's wrong?

380
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The blackboard?

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Who is it?

382
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The one that Hanazawa and I drew?

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't make me angry.

384
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't draw it with white magic.

385
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm going home.

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you having fun with the blackboard?

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Damn it.

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't make me angry.

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't like it.

390
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm going home.

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't make me angry.

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm going home.

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is it the infirmary?

394
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's closed.

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Damn it.

396
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hanazawa.

397
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I've been sick.

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I've liked you for a long time.

399
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Hanazawa.

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, no one is looking.

401
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hanazawa.

402
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, no.

403
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hanazawa.

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hanazawa.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Go.

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Who is it?

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm in the infirmary.

408
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Boss.

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Please be my friend.

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you very much.

411
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's move on.

412
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's move on.

413
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There was one person until now.

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is a combination.

415
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
130R.

416
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
130R.

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
130R sometimes comes to Tokyo.

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I've seen it.

419
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know if there are some people.

420
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This is 130R's board.

421
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This is a man.

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is real.

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is real.

424
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is real.

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is real.

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is real.

427
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is real.

428
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is a real man.

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well.

430
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Please take a look.

431
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is a real man.

432
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, this is.

433
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is very good.

434
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is a man.

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is very popular in Osaka.

436
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is a man.

437
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Good evening, everyone. It's time to get angry when you get beaten up by a big bouquet.

438
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
When you are studying hard in your study room on the second floor like him, you get very angry when you get beaten up by a big bouquet from the room below.

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So today, let's have a lot of people who come to beat up a big bouquet.

440
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This is a study room on the second floor.

441
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
First of all, it's the father's side.

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Takahiro! Takahiro! What is it, father? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. That's good. Hey! That's good.

443
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, it's not good. Father! Please! Takahiro! Takahiro!

444
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What is it? What is it? Wait! Don't ask me! Talk to me! Please!

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Next, it's the mother's side. Takahiro! Takahiro! Taka-chan!

446
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What is it, mother? What is your name?

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What is it? You bastard!

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Takahiro! Takahiro! Taka-chan! Taka-bou!

449
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What is it? There's one more.

450
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Did you hit me? I'm going to take off all my joints.

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Next, it's the dog that lives at home.

452
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Taro! Shut up! Be quiet!

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Takahiro!

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Hey! Get out, you idiot! Don't talk to a dog like that!

455
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What is it?

456
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm talking to you!

457
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What is it?

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What is it? I'm talking to you!

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You scared me.

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's something like this.

462
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Next, it's the police car.

463
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Police car? Did something happen?

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Takahiro!

465
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wow! A police car! A police car!

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Next, it's the American who stays at home.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Takahiro! Takahiro! Takahiro!

468
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Steve! What is it?

469
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Fujiyama Geisha!

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't understand!

471
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Steve!

472
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Fujiyama Geisha! I got it!

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm studying right now. I'm studying history.

474
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Sorry.

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's the second World War. It's complicated.

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Talk to me.

477
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Takahiro! Takahiro! Takahiro!

478
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Steve! What are you angry about?

479
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Apologize to Shinjiwan.

480
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Why do I have to apologize?

481
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why do I have to apologize?

482
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Tiger, tiger, tiger.

483
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, it's fine. Don't go back to the past.

484
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Orange beef.

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Toyota Nissan.

486
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's a Sony.

487
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Steve, I'm sorry.

488
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's fine.

489
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Next, it's the grandma.

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Takahiro! Takahiro!

491
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What is it, grandma?

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm scared!

493
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm scared! You're dry, aren't you?

494
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're dry, aren't you?

495
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You'll get hurt if you stay in my room.

496
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Next, it's the last one. It's the grandpa.

497
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Takahiro! Takahiro!

498
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What is it, grandpa?

499
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm taking a bath.

500
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Grandpa, I'm studying right now.

501
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Grandpa, did you just take a bath?

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Idiot, what have you been doing for 30 years?

503
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What are you talking about?

504
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't know what kind of grandpa you are.

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Idiot.

506
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Takahiro.

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Takahiro.

508
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Takahiro.

509
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Takahiro.

510
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Idiot!

511
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Next, it's the oldies.

512
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Both of you really like women.

513
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Really?

514
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Simply put, we all like women.

515
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Both of you really like women.

516
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's take a look.

517
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What kind of picture is this?

518
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This is Tochino Kimura.

519
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This Kimura has a bad habit of being a woman.

520
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Is that so?

521
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He has a bad habit of being a woman.

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you don't let him do it, he'll kick you down the stairs.

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is that so?

524
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's right.

525
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Did you witness it?

526
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I witnessed it.

527
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He also likes women.

528
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What about Tochino?

529
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He is said to be a girl killer.

530
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Good evening, everyone.

531
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Today, I would like to think about Batamon with you all.

532
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Today, we have the president of the Batamon Research Association, Mr. Kimura Yuichi.

533
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Good evening, Mr. Kimura.

534
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Good evening.

535
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The real and fake in the world.

536
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The fake is called the Batamon.

537
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's right.

538
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There are many people who are jealous of the fake.

539
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Many people are.

540
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Many people are deceived by the fake and buy it.

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There must be some inside.

542
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The fake of Renoma is called the Alema.

543
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There must be some inside.

544
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You'll know if you see it.

545
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's right.

546
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The one I'm wearing is also a fake.

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The one you're wearing today is...

548
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Can you read it for me?

549
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Kikuchi Takeo?

550
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Takeo Kikuchi.

551
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Takeo Kikuchi.

552
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's what you think, right?

553
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes.

554
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Actually, there is a mystery to this.

555
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
To this?

556
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yes.

557
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This is not Takeo Kikuchi.

558
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What?

559
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's Takeo Kigokuchi.

560
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Ah, Kigokuchi is good.

561
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know well about the designer Kigokuchi.

562
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Now, let's go.

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let me introduce you.

564
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes.

565
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Michiko London.

566
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ah, this is popular.

567
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's famous.

568
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes.

569
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
This London in England.

570
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That's right.

571
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The Batamon of this.

572
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Ah, the Batamon.

573
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If you look closely, you can see the D.

574
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The Batamon of this.

575
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Michiko Lonoon.

576
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The D is the king.

577
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The king.

578
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You'll buy this by mistake, right?

579
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I think it's French.

580
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Ah.

581
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
There is a commercial called Cecil.

582
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's famous, isn't it?

583
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Cecil, Ion, Hosonomono, Sosonomono.

584
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like French.

585
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Ah, is that so?

586
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes.

587
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This is well made, isn't it?

588
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Aba House.

589
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Aba House.

590
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a bit of a mystery.

591
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes.

592
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
This is often bought by people who buy dogs.

593
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's said to be bought by mistake.

594
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The Batamon of Aba House.

595
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Pochi House.

596
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The Batamon of Pochi House.

597
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Pochi...

598
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The one who tears the chains and runs away.

599
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The Batamon is one of the A?

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's right.

601
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
There are two Kandas.

602
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Ah.

603
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think I know this one.

604
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Something like this, the one that is not suitable for you...

605
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Is it okay, president?

606
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's okay.

607
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll be able to ask you.

608
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Next.

609
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Vivayu.

610
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Vivayu.

611
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Got it.

612
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This is, for people who often wear it, they like yakiniku.

613
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, for the person who's wearing this, yakiniku.

614
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, this person.

615
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He's laughing.

616
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's go.

617
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Take courage.

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's go!

619
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We're on a plane.

620
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's right.

621
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Biba Yu's Batamon.

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Ho!

623
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Birinba Yukke.

624
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is a bit smelly.

625
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's a bit.

626
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It doesn't suit you.

627
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Let's go to the next one.

628
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's dangerous.

629
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's dangerous.

630
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's a place where it's a spoiler.

631
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oldies?

632
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's about us.

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We're young Kansai idols, aren't we?

634
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oldies also have Batamon.

635
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Is there a Batamon in this group?

636
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's like we're Batamon ourselves.

637
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Is that so?

638
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oldies also have Batamon.

639
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Toha Tohru Riiru.

640
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Is there a Kanji in this?

641
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's hard to tell.

642
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Who would make a mistake like this?

643
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's hard to tell.

644
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's hard to tell, but it's easy to tell.

645
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Let's go to the next one.

646
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let's go to the next one.

647
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Komusa Demo.

648
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Komusa Demo.

649
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's a very chic black dress.

650
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's a nice dress.

651
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oldies also have Batamon.

652
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yes.

653
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Punchi De De.

654
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You only say De.

655
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You only say De in the middle.

656
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's about a man getting dumped.

657
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Komusa Punchi.

658
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No, no.

659
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's fine.

660
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No, it's not fine.

661
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Batamon is...

662
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If you're so angry, let's make you even angrier when you see the next one.

663
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'll make you angry.

664
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You have to be convinced.

665
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Routriamon.

666
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Routriamon.

667
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I often ask for it.

668
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What is it?

669
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You often buy it.

670
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That's right.

671
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yes, yes.

672
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
This is Batamon.

673
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Is this also on the list?

674
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
There are a lot of Enka singers.

675
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Enka singers?

676
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
To be clear,

677
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Suwara Yoichi is often...

678
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Suwara Yoichi?

679
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I was deceived and put it here.

680
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Routriamon is Batamon.

681
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes.

682
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Outside the window is Aman.

683
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This is also Kanji.

684
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Who is this?

685
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't know if it's Batamon.

686
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This tower outside and this tower...

687
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's it.

688
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Until next week, everyone.

689
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Goodbye.

690
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Goodbye.

691
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Now, finally.

692
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is...

693
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I...

694
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Why did I read this guy?

695
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He's really an amateur.

696
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I want you to see the bottom of Yoshimoto now.

697
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This is the bottom.

698
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's why I put it here.

699
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's even lower.

700
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's even lower.

701
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's even lower.

702
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's called Yamada Hanako.

703
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
This is really...

704
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's not enough here.

705
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's right.

706
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's even lower.

707
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I think it's about that.

708
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Onsei-san, step on it.

709
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

710
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's a woman like this.

711
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Let's take a look.

712
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's ugly.

713
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Look.

714
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
This is ugly, isn't it?

715
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This is...

716
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Even though it's a night shift job,

717
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
he made one wallet.

718
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Normally, if it was a woman,

719
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
wouldn't she be able to change clothes?

720
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's so small.

721
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What wallet is that?

722
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's like...

723
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Hangyodon.

724
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Hangyodon.

725
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Hangyodon.

726
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What's with you?

727
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You bit it before it fell.

728
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yes.

729
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If someone like you takes it,

730
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
what will happen to what I've done so far?

731
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Huh?

732
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Hey, why did you bite it?

733
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Even though it was before it fell.

734
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's why I bit it.

735
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
How many of those do you have?

736
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
One.

737
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Wow!

738
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You have a lot of money.

739
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

740
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't.

741
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You have a boyfriend, right?

742
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yes.

743
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Look at that!

744
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Do you do that in the summer too?

745
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Say it again, say it again!

746
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Say it again, say it again!

747
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Do you do that in the summer too?

748
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That's about it.

749
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That was Hanako Yamada.

750
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Now, after this,

751
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
we'll do a little bit of it,

752
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
so please look forward to it.

753
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Then, here.

754
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Right?

755
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This is Dan Dan Hamada.

756
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It stretches out like this.

757
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Isn't that your dad?

758
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's my dad!

759
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Why do you have something like that?

760
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It stretches out like this.

761
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's my sister!

762
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm the one who called her Kako.

763
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That's my name!

764
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sure you all feel the same way,

765
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
but I'm not.

766
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
When I first saw it,

767
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I thought it was a prank camera.

768
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm Dan Dan.

769
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Hello, everyone.

770
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The show is over, isn't it?

771
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's right.

772
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's good.

773
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Right?

774
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The mic was too short for Hanako.

775
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But recently,

776
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
there's one more comedy show, right?

777
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We haven't done it yet.

778
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The quiz show is the most popular, isn't it?

779
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The quiz show.

780
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The quiz show is very popular.

781
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
If you look at the news,

782
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
what was it?

783
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Itsumi-san is doing it.

784
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
She's doing it.

785
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The quiz show is the best.

786
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Is that so?

787
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's right.

788
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm also thinking about a quiz show.

789
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
If I do that,

790
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
it'll definitely get a lot of views.

791
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's the same thing these days.

792
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's the same pattern.

793
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There's a good one.

794
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What is it?

795
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
There's a quiz called Doremi Fadon, right?

796
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll add a normal quiz to that.

797
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
For example,

798
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
there was a quiz about the height of Mt. Fuji.

799
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Fuji?

800
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'll think of a question to answer.

801
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You know it?

802
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You don't even know the question.

803
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It'll get a lot of views.

804
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It'll get a lot of views?

805
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Is that so?

806
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No one can win.

807
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll give you a quiz today.

808
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll give you a question.

809
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

810
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I won't give you a question.

811
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Even if you watch a quiz show,

812
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
you can't think of anything.

813
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Travel or prize money.

814
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Normally, you'd say something like

815
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
how many million or Hawaii trip.

816
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If you do something,

817
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I can't do it.

818
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If you answer the question,

819
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll teach you how to put on makeup.

820
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't need that!

821
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll think of a question to answer.

822
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Why don't you teach me that?

823
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Why?

824
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Why can't I do that?

825
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I can't do that.

826
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Philippines.

827
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If that's the case,

828
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'll take a trip to the Philippines.

829
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's impossible to travel.

830
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Can you become a Filipino from tomorrow?

831
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't need that!

832
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If I get it right,

833
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
how can I become a Filipino?

834
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Why don't you transfer the residents?

835
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Why are you going that far?

836
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Isn't it fashionable?

837
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
If you become a Filipino.

838
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Idiot!

839
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
From now on,

840
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm going to be an ebuki.

841
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
If that's the case,

842
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't want to be a resident.

843
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'll go.

844
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll think about it.

845
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'll go.

846
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Question 1.

847
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Taro-kun went to the flower shop

848
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
to buy flowers.

849
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, what is it?

850
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Peck-peck.

851
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Peck-peck?

852
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
нас free.

853
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You went to the flower shop to buy flowers.

854
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Well, what is it?

855
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
tiングye?

856
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, what is it?

857
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What's that?

858
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
happening with that word.

859
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll ask other people.

860
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What's that?

861
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You went to the flower shop to buy flowers.

862
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, what is it?

863
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Please eat exotic plants.

864
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Come on!

865
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
pues explain pas-pr downloaded

866
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Exotic Quiz.

867
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
What is Exotic Quiz?

868
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What is Exotic Quiz in the name of a quiz?

869
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Simply put, it's the second question.

870
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Well, there's no second question.

871
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, that Exotic Quiz is good.

872
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yoshio-kun went to the bathhouse.

873
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, what is it?

874
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

875
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yoshio-kun went to the bathhouse.

876
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

877
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yoshio-kun went to the bathhouse.

878
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What is it?

879
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Is it different from Yoshio-kun?

880
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yoshio-kun went to the bathhouse.

881
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What is it?

882
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
This is a new pattern.

883
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What is it that Yoshio-kun went to the bathhouse?

884
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What kind of question is that?

885
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's a question that's hard to understand.

886
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No one can answer it.

887
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
If it's hard to understand,

888
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
if you think of it as one rupee and three yen, it's easy to understand.

889
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What are you talking about?

890
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
What are you talking about?

891
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I understand.

892
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let's make it easy to understand the question.

893
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't get angry.

894
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I want to get angry.

895
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This is the first time I've done this.

896
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Why?

897
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm about to lose my temper.

898
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But I'll do it.

899
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Do it properly.

900
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't understand your problem.

901
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yoshio-kun went to the bathhouse.

902
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Listen to this.

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's because Yoshio-kun loves baths.

904
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
There's something like shampoo and conditioner these days.

905
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes, yes.

906
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yoshio-kun doesn't like that kind of thing.

907
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yoshio-kun likes shampoo and conditioner separately.

908
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yoshio-kun...

909
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Well, what is it?

910
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's the same thing.

911
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It has nothing to do with shampoo and conditioner.

912
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's easy to understand.

913
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Executivo quiz.

914
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
What?

915
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Executivo quiz?

916
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes.

917
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What is it?

918
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What is it?

919
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Executivo quiz is...

920
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That's enough.

921
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You can choose the question.

922
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, me?

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Performance, history, society, geography.

924
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes.

925
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You can choose.

926
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's good.

927
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Please choose.

928
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Performance, history, geography.

929
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Geography?

930
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes.

931
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
History.

932
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
History?

933
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Bim bom, bim bom, bim bom, bim bom, chance card!

934
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Thank you.

935
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's a chance card.

936
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If you can answer this, you'll get double.

937
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What?

938
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Me?

939
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You'll get double?

940
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's big.

941
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I want to see it, so I'll get it right.

942
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Do your best.

943
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's history quiz.

944
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes.

945
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I got it.

946
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oda Nobunaga!

947
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What are you doing?

948
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What are you doing?

949
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
What?

950
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't know.

951
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What are you doing?

952
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Change the question.

953
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What? Change the question.

954
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What?

955
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
What?

956
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Do you know?

957
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What are you doing, Oda Nobunaga?

958
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What?

959
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What are you doing, Oda Nobunaga?

960
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Siding Queen!

961
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Bim bom, bim bom, bim bom.

962
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm standing.

963
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm standing.

964
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I said it randomly.

965
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I said it randomly.

966
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm standing.

967
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's a standing quiz.

968
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I got it, Mr. Hamada.

969
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What?

970
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm going to quit the previous quiz.

971
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You said it from the beginning.

972
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Let's make it a choice quiz.

973
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What is a choice quiz?

974
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
There were three choices.

975
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

976
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's go with that pattern.

977
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That's good.

978
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That's easy.

979
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's not fun with three choices.

980
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's a 20-choice quiz.

981
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's even more difficult.

982
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It's different.

983
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Baby, it's different.

984
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
What is it, Mr. Hamada?

985
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What kind of question is that?

986
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's a quiz question.

987
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Are you ready?

988
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The question is very easy.

989
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Let me tell you the question.

990
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The question is

991
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Who is the current Prime Minister of Japan?

992
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Is that the question?

993
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's very easy.

994
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yes.

995
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Wait a minute.

996
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Do you have 20 strange questions?

997
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Do you know the answer?

998
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
When you hear the question,

999
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
press the button and answer it.

1000
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm sorry.

1001
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Answer the question as it is.

1002
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I know the answer.

1003
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You know the answer?

1004
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's not easy.

1005
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Don't worry.

1006
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll ask you until I get the answer.

1007
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That's good.

1008
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's go.

1009
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Tanaka

1010
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Harada

1011
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Haino

1012
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Kusakabe

1013
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Kanami

1014
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Jerry

1015
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's definitely wrong.

1016
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That's wrong.

1017
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Ota

1018
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's wrong.

1019
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Jiro

1020
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's a lower name.

1021
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That's impossible.

1022
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Kaifu

1023
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Pimpo

1024
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Mr. Hamada

1025
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Please give me the answer.

1026
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Kaifu

1027
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Mr. Hamada, tell me the number.

1028
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Tell me from the beginning.

1029
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Tell me from the beginning.

1030
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You can say Kaifu.

1031
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Even if you don't say the number.

1032
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's Kaifu.

1033
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's Kaifu.

1034
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Saichenkui

1035
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Amazing.

1036
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What is Saichenkui?

1037
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Is this China?

1038
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This is the last question.

1039
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Why did you say Saichenkui in the last question?

1040
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's meet again, Saichenkui.

1041
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Saichenkui

1042
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Mr. Hamada

1043
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That's too bad.

1044
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That's no good.

1045
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm sorry.

1046
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Really.

1047
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's enough.

1048
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm sorry.

1049
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
This is the last quiz.

1050
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
This is very easy.

1051
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm going to say all the numbers I've done so far.

1052
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Numbers?

1053
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You can't even get one right.

1054
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's right.

1055
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Good luck.

1056
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
This is really easy.

1057
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Is that so?

1058
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Let's move on to the next question.

1059
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What is the weather like in the Tokyo area on June 16th?

1060
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I think you're going to get it wrong, Mr. Hamada.

1061
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Why don't you say it?

1062
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I want to pinch you.

1063
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Go ahead.

1064
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Why don't you say it?

1065
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Tell me the answer.

1066
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't know.

1067
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm sorry.

1068
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm watching TV.

1069
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I think he's stupid.

1070
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's okay.

1071
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'll give you time today.

1072
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You can go outside and watch.

1073
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's enough.

1074
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know.

1075
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll say it clearly.

1076
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't know.

1077
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You tell me the answer.

1078
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The answer is

1079
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
rain.

1080
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The answer is

1081
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the sun.

1082
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The answer is

1083
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
the clouds.

1084
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'll leave the rest to the editor.

1085
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That's all for today.

1086
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
If you have another chance,

1087
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
this member will be on the show.

1088
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's right.

1089
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There are still other members other than today.

1090
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's right.

1091
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We don't have much time.

1092
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Anyway, this member will be on the show.

1093
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
There are other members.

1094
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's right.

1095
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
This member will be on the show.

1096
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's right.

1097
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This member will be on the show.

1098
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That's right.

1099
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I hope you watch the show.

1100
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Thank you very much.

1101
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Thank you.

1102
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Thank you.

1103
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I love you.

1104
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Thank you very much.

1105
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
How was it today?

1106
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The members who will be on the show.

1107
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That's right.

1108
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well,

1109
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I spent more money than usual.

1110
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You didn't.

1111
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You didn't.

1112
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The members who will be on the show.

1113
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Everyone is cheap.

1114
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's right.

1115
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Everyone is cheap.

1116
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I thought about it.

1117
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Using such cheap members,

1118
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I thought I would make the show more exciting.

1119
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But I can't do it.

1120
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Well,

1121
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Actually,

1122
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I thought I would make the show more exciting.

1123
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That's right.

1124
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's one of the tricks of Mr.Ozaki.

1125
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I don't understand.

1126
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Is that so?

1127
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Who is it?

1128
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No, no.

1129
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
If there is a chance,

1130
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I hope you watch the show more.

1131
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Thank you very much.

1132
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I will come back as usual.

1133
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That's right.

1134
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Please watch the show.

1135
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Well,

1136
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Mr.Sumon will be on the show.

1137
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Please look forward to it.

1138
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Also,

1139
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Mr.Ashishi will be on the show.

1140
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He will be on the show with me.

1141
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Please look forward to it.

1142
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Mr.Ashishi will be on the show.

1143
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
He will be on the show with me.

1144
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Please look forward to it.

1145
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
See you next time.

1146
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Good bye.

1147
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Please look forward to it.
