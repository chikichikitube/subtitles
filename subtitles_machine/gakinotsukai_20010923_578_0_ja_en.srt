Thank you for the food.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The sake is delicious.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The sake is delicious.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Actually, the cooler broke.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I think it's a little hot.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll fix it right away.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please be patient for a while.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's hot.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a little hot.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's hot.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's hot.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's hot.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's really hot today.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The cooler is broken.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's hot.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's really hot.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was hot.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Isn't it hot?

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a little hot.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's still hot.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's hot.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't stand it.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is it hot?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't stand it.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Can you take it off?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's hot.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's hot.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's hot.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can I take it off?

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't care.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The cooler is broken.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's hot.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's hot.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's hot.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's cold.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's hot.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's in front of the pot.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's hot.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's hot.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When I take it off, it's a little hot.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
When I take it off, it's a little hot.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's good.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The staff isn't hot.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's really sweaty.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the hottest place.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is the show.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's hot.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's hot, but it's good.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's hot.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's hot, but it's good.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's hot.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's hot.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you okay?

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm fine.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's hot.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's hot.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's hot.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Really?

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's already spring.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's hot.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's hot.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's hot.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's really hot.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's hot.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's hot.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I blew one.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you okay?

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can't stand it.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You can't stand it.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I understand.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Really.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't stand it.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't have confidence.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's hot.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
My hands are like Onuma's hands.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Really?

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Can I have one?

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sure.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I see.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It looks good.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I can't stand it.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is it hot?

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't stand it.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's hot.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's hot.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's good to wait.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's good to wait.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Crab is delicious.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's delicious.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's the best.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's the best, but it's hot.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's hot.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have a cold.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you have a fever?

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I have a fever.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's hot.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's hot.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Soup is hot.

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's hot to drink soup.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's hot to drink soup.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's hot.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's hot.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's hot.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's hot, isn't it?

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You haven't eaten anything yet.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't stand it.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can't stand it, can you?

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't stand it.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't stand it.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's hot.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can't stand it.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's too hot to stand it.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why do you have to put up with it?

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It was hot, wasn't it?

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It was hot, wasn't it?

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was really hot.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not laughing.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm laughing.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's hot, isn't it?

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, no, no, no.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What is it?

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is it?

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The steam is all on Mr. Nakamura.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's true.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:10:01,000
One more.

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can't stop laughing.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mr. Nakamura, isn't this too much?

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's hot.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's hot.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's hot.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's hot.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's hot.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's hot.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're dirty.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're dirty.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's hot.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's hot.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you take it off?

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I take it off.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I take it off.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's hot, isn't it?

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's hot.

156
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's hot.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's hot, isn't it?

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's hot when you eat it all.

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's hot, isn't it?

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's hot.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's hot.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's hot.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's hot.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's hot.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is not so hot.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's hot.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's hot.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No, no, no, no.

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's hot.

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No, no, no, no.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's hot.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It looks delicious.

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's hot.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's hot.

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's hot.

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's really hot.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's hot.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's hot.

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,880
This is a

180
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
B-H-A-N-D

181
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
It hurts...

182
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Hey! Good evening!

183
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Recently, I don't think I can get angry anymore.

184
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
You can't get angry?

185
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Yeah.

186
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I used to be like that, but I didn't do much.

187
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Ah, I see.

188
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Maybe I don't have enough calcium.

189
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
It doesn't matter.

190
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Recently, I've gotten really angry.

191
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,880
I went to a video store and borrowed a romance novelist.

192
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
I see.

193
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Well, it's a good thing.

194
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
But now it's a week's rent.

195
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,880
I borrowed it, but it's 300 yen, to be honest.

196
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I thought, let's see it today.

197
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I was looking forward to it.

198
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
I dug it up and played it.

199
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
I didn't say a word.

200
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Huh?

201
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
What is this? What is this novelist?

202
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
It has nothing to do with the novelist.

203
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
I thought, I don't have enough calcium.

204
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
It's strange.

205
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
I pulled it out.

206
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
What is it? The back of the neck?

207
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
The back of the neck?

208
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
The back of the neck.

209
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
I opened it and it surprised me.

210
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,880
There's no tape.

211
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
What?

212
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
There's no tape?

213
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,880
No, no. If it was normal, it would be like this.

214
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
What do you mean there's no tape?

215
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
There's nothing on the tape.

216
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
But if you look at it here, it looks like Baumkuchen.

217
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
That's why it's cut off.

218
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
It's cut off, right?

219
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:13,880
If it's normal, if it's me before, if it's me when I was a chimp, if it's me when I was a jackknife, that's why it's cut off.

220
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
No, no, no, it's okay not to cut it off.

221
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
It's okay not to cut it off in response to what you said.

222
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
No, it's not.

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,880
At that time, I thought it was the end, so I called.

224
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Did you call?

225
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I called the video store.

226
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,880
I called the video store and said, Maruto, I'm not angry that it's like this.

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,880
But I said, I have to return it.

228
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
You're saying something big again.

229
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
That's right.

230
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I'm a novelist who has nothing to do with this.

231
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,880
When I asked him why I had to return it, he said, what do you mean?

232
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Why are you laughing?

233
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
You're crazy.

234
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Even if I go to return this, no matter what kind of transportation method I use, it doesn't cost me money.

235
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
You shouldn't say such a thing.

236
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
That's right.

237
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
If I go by car, I have to pay for gas, if I go by bus, I have to pay for the bus.

238
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Isn't it funny? This stupid phone is also my phone!

239
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm going to get 300 yen.

241
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
What is 300 yen?

242
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm going to get the 300 yen I borrowed.

243
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,880
But I don't want to take this video.

244
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
That's why.

245
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
What I'm saying is nothing wrong, right?

246
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
It's nothing wrong, right?

247
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
No, no, no.

248
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,880
You shouldn't say such a thing.

249
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Okay, I got it.

250
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
It's something like that, right?

251
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Then you can take it on my behalf.

252
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,880
But I can't keep the deadline.

253
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I don't know if it will be 5 years later or 10 years later.

254
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
What the hell is that?

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
You just want to wear it, right?

256
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
No, no, no.

257
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
You wanted to wear it for someone.

258
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
No, no, no.

259
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
That's not true.

260
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
So what kind of transportation method should I use?

261
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm not asking you to give it back to me.

262
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm asking you to give it back to me when I go somewhere.

263
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Are you stupid?

264
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Then I have to keep this video all the time.

265
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I don't know when I'm going to go, but I don't know if I'm going today.

266
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I've been holding it all the time.

267
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
When I open it, it's like this.

268
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
It's strange, isn't it?

269
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,880
It's strange, isn't it?

270
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
In the end, I said, okay, we'll keep the deadline.

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
I don't know if it will be a month or two.

272
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
I went to the beginning.

273
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
I don't know if I'm going by taxi, so I'll give you the receipt at that time.

274
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I'll give it to you.

275
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
What did you say?

276
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Well, yes.

277
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Once I went somewhere by car and took a taxi from there.

278
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Do you want me to give you the money?

279
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,880
I'll give it to you.

280
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Really?

281
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I'm not saying this because you say it.

282
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,880
You're the one who made me look bad.

283
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm going to get 300 yen.

284
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Let's say the same thing happened.

285
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,880
You borrowed a love novel.

286
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I borrowed a love novel today.

287
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Wait a minute.

288
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Who are you telling that to?

289
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
No, it's a wife and a child.

290
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,880
It's a child.

291
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Hooray!

292
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Please continue with the trial.

293
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Hooray!

294
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
It's shiny.

295
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
It's shiny.

296
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Okay, then I'll put it in the deck.

297
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Please put it in the deck.

298
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Please put it in the deck.

299
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
What are you going to do?

300
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
I don't know.

301
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
I can't see it.

302
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
It's a child.

303
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Why?

304
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Why?

305
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,880
It's like a slipper.

306
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,880
I have a question for Alphys.

307
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Yes.

308
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Look around in the snowy mountains.

309
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
You'll run into a big tree with that momentum.

310
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You'll hit the tree with your whole body.

311
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,880
And then you'll be buried deep in the snow.

312
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Please tell me how to escape.

313
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
I don't have that kind of experience.

314
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I don't think I'll be told right away.

315
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
No, no, no, no.

316
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
There is.

317
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
What?

318
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
It's a misunderstanding.

319
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Really?

320
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Please tell me what's going on.

321
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I was skiing.

322
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
I was trying to get in the mood.

323
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
I see.

324
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
You were having fun, right?

325
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
And then?

326
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
I was thinking, this is Gelen.

327
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
It's heavier than before.

328
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
I was thinking.

329
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I was sliding.

330
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
I was rolling.

331
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,880
What does that have to do with the flow?

332
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
No, it's not.

333
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I was rolling and I hit the tree.

334
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
And then?

335
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
I was sliding.

336
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
I see.

337
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
I was the one who started it.

338
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
It wasn't just you.

339
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
All the people around you.

340
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
But the people around me.

341
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,880
It was a time when I shouldn't have done it.

342
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
I was at the top of the mountain.

343
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
What?

344
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Really?

345
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Yes.

346
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Skiing on one foot is basically forbidden.

347
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Yes.

348
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
There weren't many people around.

349
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
So.

350
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
When I was sliding.

351
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
I thought everyone liked skiing on one foot.

352
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
And then.

353
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I was hit by the guard.

354
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,880
It wasn't a pool.

355
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
That's not good.

356
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
I was scared.

357
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I understand.

358
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I was scared.

359
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I didn't expect it to happen.

360
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
I was hit by the guard.

361
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
I understand.

362
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
And then.

363
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
The time passed slowly.

364
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Everyone turned their faces away.

365
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I pretended to have two hands.

366
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,880
No one was looking.

367
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
No one was looking.

368
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I tried to ride on my own.

369
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I was the only one.

370
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I was on my own.

371
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
I was on my own.

372
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I was on my own.

373
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
I wasn't even holding hands.

374
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
You weren't even holding hands.

375
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Really?

376
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I was holding hands.

377
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
I was holding hands.

378
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,880
But I was holding hands like this.

379
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Then I went up.

380
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Like a giant tree.

381
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I didn't go up like a huge tree.

382
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I spread it like a strong branch.

383
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Then the enemy started to come.

384
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Awesome.

385
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
That was amazing.

386
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
You've been hoodwinked.

387
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
That's right.

388
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
When did you realize that?

389
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Ichatani did it like that.

390
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Like 5 meters down.

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Think of this ceiling as snow.

392
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
It's like this under it.

393
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,880
It doesn't move at all.

394
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Snow is white. That's a lie.

395
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm the only one who knows this.

396
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Snow is dark.

397
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,880
It's a place to laugh.

398
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
It's dark.

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
What should we do? It's 5 meters.

400
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
How do we reach it?

401
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,880
I've said this many times.

402
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Don't mess around.

403
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I see.

404
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Rather, it feels like a god.

405
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,880
It's like this.

406
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Why is it moving?

407
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,880
I wanted to make it look like a Christ.

408
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,880
I see.

409
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,880
So I waited for 5 to 10 minutes.

410
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I see.

411
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
It was a big deal.

412
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
There were 50 to 60 angels from above.

413
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
It's amazing.

414
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
50 to 60 angels.

415
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I see.

416
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,880
It was like this.

417
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,880
It was like this.

418
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,880
It doesn't move.

419
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I see.

420
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
It doesn't move at all.

421
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
It's like this.

422
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm impressed with that.

423
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
It's like this.

424
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
It's like a rock bath.

425
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
It's cold.

426
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
It's like a rock bath.

427
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
It's cold.

428
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
It's like a rock bath.

429
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
It's like a rock bath.

430
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
It's like a rock bath.

431
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Really?

432
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
It feels good.

433
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
It feels good.

434
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
What is that?

435
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Is that a cigarette?

436
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,880
It feels good.

437
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,880
This hand is also an angel.

438
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Are you helping me with everything?

439
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
When will you come back to your senses?

440
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,880
I can't say thank you.

441
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm going back to my senses with the karaoke box.

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Why did you bring the karaoke box?

443
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
This is also an angel's work.

444
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
What is that?

445
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Tomorrow is the day after tomorrow.

446
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,880
The one singing is an angel.

447
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Are you going to sing?

448
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:24,880
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
