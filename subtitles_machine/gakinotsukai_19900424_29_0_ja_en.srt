1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikichiki Warasube Chouja Daigashisen!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Dun dun dun dun dun dun!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we're going to do a quick exchange.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You and I are going to take a copy of the Japanese TV show

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and go all the way to Akasaka.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For example, this is the product you have.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you take a picture of this broadcast paper...

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is the set of Arai.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is what it looks like.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is pretty nice, isn't it?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's pretty good for children and old people.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It will make a wide range of people happy.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is the set of the Japanese TV show I like.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't need it!

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's too weak.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This!

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But it might be good on a rainy day.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Really?

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's better to take each of these and buy something more expensive.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How much would it be if I bought this?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
About 1,500 yen?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's about right.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, let's go.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Do you have 20 minutes?

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm counting on you.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You spent a lot of time the other day, didn't you?

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's a pretty good deal.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's cowardly.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't want to waste my time.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll give you 400 yen.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's a problem, so I'll do my best.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a problem after all.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, let's go for now.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you have anything you can exchange?

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A tissue.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you kidding me?

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mom, come here.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mom, let's talk.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's a good character.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm going to the supermarket.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll take this.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
3,500 yen.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Excuse me.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How much is it?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
3,500 yen.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Here you go.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's not it.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who's going to do it?

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a Japanese TV show.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to exchange things.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to buy something from your shop.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm doing it.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So I'm going to buy something from your shop.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to buy something from your shop.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The most expensive one.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The most expensive one.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And this.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want you to exchange this with this.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll do it.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you sure?

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You did it.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is a persimmon.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You like persimmons, don't you?

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's delicious.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's delicious.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And this.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is nice.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This bouquet.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm going to exchange it for 4 of them.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please wait a second.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is it okay?

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's okay.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's okay?

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a good thing.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to tell you about the shop.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is in Akasaka.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kirishima Flower.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Akasaka.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm looking for a part-time job.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm not asking for experience. I'm asking for a person with guts.

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Why do you need guts to be a flower gardener?

87
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Thank you very much.

88
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
It's about 3,500 yen.

89
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
3,500 yen?

90
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I can't go anywhere.

91
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
You can't go anywhere?

92
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Can't you go to Kyushu?

93
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Do you have a day trip tour to Kyushu?

94
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
If I'm going to walk, I can.

95
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
You're going to walk? You idiot.

96
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Excuse me.

97
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Well,

98
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,880
I'd like to give you this bouquet of flowers.

99
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
I'll give it to you.

100
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Can you put a perm on my hair?

101
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,880
I can't help but look at you.

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Excuse me.

103
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
This bouquet of flowers.

104
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Can you buy me a more luxurious one?

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
I'll sell this at this store.

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Can you give me a bouquet of flowers worth 10,000 yen?

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
That's a lot.

108
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Is this okay?

109
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
It's okay.

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
You're not saying this is cheap, are you?

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
It's not cheap.

112
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm just showing you the melon.

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Excuse me.

114
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Can you give me a Piero of this pistol?

115
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Which one do you want?

116
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
This one and this one.

117
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
With melon.

118
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Do you want to do it?

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Yes.

120
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Please give it to me.

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
I'll give this to you.

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
This one.

123
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
This is the last one.

124
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Where did you get this?

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
From Jaeger.

126
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Jaeger.

127
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,880
This is a shirt worth 12,000 yen from Jaeger.

128
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Plus Christian Dior's handkerchief set.

129
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,880
In the end, it's back to this.

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Idiot.

131
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,880
You're such an idiot.

132
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
It's Christian Dior.

133
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Well.

134
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,880
This is 12,000 yen and this is 3,000 yen, so it's 15,000 yen.

135
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
I'll stop here.

136
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Then I'll go.

137
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
With this bouquet of flowers.

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
This kind of thing.

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Yes.

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Here you are.

141
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
This...

142
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
What is this?

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
What is this?

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
This girl.

145
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,880
When I said I'll give you this bouquet of flowers, she followed me.

146
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Can you do it with a bouquet of flowers?

147
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Yes.

148
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Yes, I can.

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Really?

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
I really did it.

151
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
You did it with me, right?

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
I did.

153
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
I said I did it.

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Really?

155
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Yes.

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Let me do it, too.

157
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Really?

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
You have to do it.

159
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Three pieces?

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
If you don't have flowers, she doesn't have eyes for flowers.

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
I'll go buy some.

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
I'll run around with flowers.

163
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Yes.

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
That's amazing.

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Yes.

166
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
That's right.

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
If you don't bring me a bouquet of flowers.

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes, I'll go to the center.

169
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
I see.

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
But I brought the manager, too.

171
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Did you do it with the manager?

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Can you do it with me?

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Did you do it with the manager?

174
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Manager.

175
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Manager.

176
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
The manager was good.

177
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Hello.

178
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
What's going on?

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
He's already laughing.

180
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
What's so funny?

181
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,880
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.

182
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
I was thinking about what to do today.

183
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,880
It's embarrassing to make a mistake.

184
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
A mistake?

185
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
The day before yesterday.

186
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
There was an ugly woman who always came to the apartment.

187
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,880
She told me to leave the apartment alone.

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
I didn't care.

189
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
If it was a normal person, I would apologize.

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
I like to lie.

191
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm sorry.

192
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
I'm sorry.

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,880
My fans are usually ugly.

196
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Why?

197
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm really shy.

198
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm walking in the morning.

199
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm walking in the morning.

200
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm scared.

201
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm walking like I'm possessed by something.

202
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I thought this stupid woman would come again.

203
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,880
I stopped the car and opened the window.

204
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
I looked at her.

205
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
She was completely different.

206
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
She looked like you.

207
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
She looked like me.

208
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
I looked at her.

209
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
She was completely different.

210
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Her face was expressionless.

211
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I couldn't do it.

212
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Why?

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Her face was expressionless.

214
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Her face was expressionless.

215
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
What did she say?

216
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
She said,

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Walk on the sidewalk.

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
She said,

219
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
It's dangerous.

220
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
It's dangerous.

221
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,880
She looked like her sister's brother who died in a car accident.

222
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
She was like a parent.

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
She was like,

224
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
It's dangerous.

225
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
She closed the window and looked at me.

226
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
I feel sorry for you.

227
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
I said,

228
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I did something bad.

229
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
You didn't do anything.

230
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
You just came to my house.

231
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
I said that, but I didn't like it.

232
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Why?

233
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,880
I don't know what the middle and high school students are thinking.

234
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,880
There was a man who took a picture of the door of the apartment.

235
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
What did he take?

236
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
You didn't do it.

237
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
I didn't do it.

238
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
That's why everyone laughed.

239
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
He said,

240
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Bring it here.

241
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Bring it here.

242
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
When I came back,

243
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Are you stupid?

244
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
That's all.

245
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
That's not me.

246
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
It's a picture.

247
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I was surprised when I came back.

248
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Well,

249
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Well,

250
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
What?

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
There's something we have to do.

252
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,880
We have to communicate with each other.

253
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Yes.

254
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,880
And I can communicate with anyone.

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
For example,

256
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Let's say Hamada says,

257
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Yuuri.

258
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Then,

259
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Rinsu.

260
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
First of all,

261
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,880
I'm the owner who can always return it with su.

262
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
What did you think?

263
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
He says it's impossible.

264
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
It's impossible for me.

265
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,880
That's why we're going to play a game of winning and losing.

266
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
The loser has to play a penalty game.

267
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes.

268
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
It's like a zoom-in in the morning.

269
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,880
It's like a zoom-in in the morning.

270
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
And we said,

271
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Let's think about it.

272
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Did you think about it?

273
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
I didn't think about it.

274
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I can see your enthusiasm for this program.

275
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I've thought about it a lot.

276
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Penalty game.

277
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
For example,

278
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Alta.

279
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Studio Alta.

280
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Studio Alta.

281
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,880
There's a big screen of Alta, right?

282
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,880
The loser has to come out there.

283
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh,

284
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
That's good.

285
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Yes.

286
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
How do you come out?

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,880
I have to tie the rope.

288
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
SM rope?

289
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Yes.

290
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
The rope is like this.

291
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The middle is like this.

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
The ground is like this.

293
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
One by one.

294
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
It's like this.

295
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes.

296
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
It's like this.

297
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
On the big screen of Alta.

298
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Look at the staff.

299
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Next Tuesday.

300
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Yes.

301
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
At 1.40 pm.

302
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I'll be in charge of the staff of Alta.

303
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Yes.

304
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
What is that?

305
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Don't you have to say that it's hard to tie the rope?

306
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Yes.

307
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Yes.

308
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I see.

309
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
I'll do that.

310
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Yes.

311
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Do you understand?

312
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Yes.

313
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Let's do it.

314
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Let's do it.

315
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll do it.

316
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
You do it.

317
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Yes.

318
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
I'll do it.

319
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Yes.

320
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Suwashi.

321
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
What?

322
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,880
You're at this distance.

323
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Where did you ask me?

324
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Suwashi.

325
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
What is Suwashi?

326
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
It's Suwashi.

327
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
It's a foot that doesn't wear socks.

328
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Shiwasu.

329
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
You're beautiful from the front.

330
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Five, four...

331
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Suito.

332
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Why?

333
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
What?

334
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
It's Suito.

335
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Usu.

336
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Suika.

337
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Suika.

338
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Karasu.

339
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Swimming.

340
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Grease.

341
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Wait a minute.

342
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Wait a minute.

343
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Suetto.

344
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
What?

345
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Tosu.

346
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Tosu?

347
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Wait a minute.

348
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
You've been breaking the rules.

349
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
What?

350
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
You should have told me earlier.

351
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
What?

352
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
You should have told me earlier.

353
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Su?

354
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
I didn't hear you.

355
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
You shouldn't have told me.

356
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
You shouldn't have told me.

357
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I didn't hear you.

358
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
You should have told me.

359
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I didn't hear you.

360
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
I didn't hear you.

361
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm thinking about it now.

362
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
I didn't hear you.

363
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
What?

364
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
What are you doing?

365
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
I'm going to finish this.

366
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm going to finish this.

367
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
You're scary.

368
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Suomachi.

369
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
What?

370
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
What?

371
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
It's in Osaka.

372
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
You can't say the name of the town.

373
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,880
You can't say the name of the town.

374
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
You're breaking the rules.

375
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
You can't say the name of the town.

376
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
You've been breaking the rules.

377
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
I don't care.

378
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm a professional wrestler.

379
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
You're a wrestler?

380
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I didn't hear you.

381
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Say it.

382
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I'm from Scandinavia.

383
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
You can't say the name of the town.

384
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
I'm from Skye.

385
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
What?

386
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
I'm from Skye.

387
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,880
You can't say the name of the town.

388
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Skye.

389
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Is.

390
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Fine.

391
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
I don't care.

392
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Skye.

393
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
What?

394
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
I'm from Skye.

395
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
You're strange.

396
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
You can say the name of the town.

397
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I can say the name of the town.

398
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
You're stupid.

399
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
You're stupid.

400
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm from Skye.

401
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
You can't say that.

402
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm from Skye.

403
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
You can't say that.

404
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Say it properly.

405
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Explain it.

406
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Say it properly.

407
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
What is Skye?

408
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
It's a pronoun.

409
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
It has nothing to do with it.

410
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
You can't say it.

411
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Say it.

412
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Say it quickly.

413
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Shut up.

414
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
I won't listen to you.

415
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
It's been a long time.

416
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Sukiyaki.

417
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Kirigirisu.

418
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Skip.

419
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Prince.

420
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Pan.

421
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Scuba.

422
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Burth.

423
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
What is the name of the town?

424
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Is it strange?

425
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Why?

426
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Is the name of the town strange?

427
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
It's fine.

428
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Don't laugh.

429
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I'm thinking while doing this.

430
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I'm a double young.

431
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Do it quickly.

432
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm a double young.

433
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Do it quickly.

434
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Wait.

435
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
You don't need my song.

436
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Three.

437
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Wait.

438
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Say it quickly.

439
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
It's been a long time.

440
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Scratch.

441
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
What is that?

442
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Chadan-su.

443
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Skate.

444
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Base.

445
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Base.

446
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Base.

447
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Tsukekomashi.

448
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
You can't do that.

449
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Why?

450
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Make it something that can be brought.

451
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Tsukekomashi.

452
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Yes.

453
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Tsukekomashi.

454
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
How many people are there?

455
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
That's small.

456
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Yes.

457
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Tsukekomashi.

458
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Let's end it.

459
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Let's stop it.

460
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Let's end it.

461
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Let's end it.

462
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
What are you doing?

463
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Shihira Kansun.

464
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
I lost.

465
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Sugoroku.

466
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
It's fine.

467
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
You lost.

468
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
No one saw it.

469
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
There's nothing left.

470
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Sugoroku.

471
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Cross.

472
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Sushi.

473
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Shiwasu.

474
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Yuta.

475
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,880
The shiwasu I said earlier is from the day before yesterday.

476
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
It doesn't matter.

477
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
You lost.

478
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
You lost.

479
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
You lost.

480
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
It's over.

481
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
It's not good.

482
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
It's over.

483
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
It's over.

484
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
It's over.

485
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
It's over.

486
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Aruta and Matsumoto-kun.

487
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I'll be with you when you take this.

488
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I'll help you tie it up.

489
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Really?

490
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I'll watch over you.

491
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
It's just the two of us.

492
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Don't make me laugh.

493
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,880
After graduating from high school,

494
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,880
I got a job at Nippon Arbite News.

495
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Matsumoto-kun called me Matsumoto-kun.

496
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Matsumoto-kun, let's go to Yoshimoto together and do it.

497
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Where did you go at that time?

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
What are you going to do with our history?

499
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Why don't we do it together?

500
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
But that's...

501
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
That's...

502
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Matsumoto-kun.

503
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
The two of you are careful with your eyes.

504
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
That's not the case.

505
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Do it properly.

506
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Let's do it together.

507
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
No, I can't do it.

508
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I'll watch over you.

509
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
You're really dirty.

510
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,880
What?

511
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
That's it.

512
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I think it's out now.

513
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I think it's out.

514
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
We'll meet in front of the altar at the time of the event.

515
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Please look forward to it.

516
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
I want you to come to see it.

517
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
That's for sure.

518
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880
The people who are here today are crazy.

519
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
It's true.

520
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,880
You guys are the only ones who remember the face.

521
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Do you have enough time today?

522
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Please give me a postcard.

523
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Today, too.

524
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Assistant.

525
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,880
It's been a long time since I've seen you dressed like this on our show.

526
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Why don't you try to tie your hair?

527
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
I'd like to see that.

528
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Do you have a boyfriend?

529
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
No.

530
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
You're looking for a boyfriend?

531
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Who do you want to see?

532
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Well...

533
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,880
You don't have to tie your hair like that.

534
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
I don't like it.

535
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Thank you very much.

536
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Thank you very much.

537
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I put it in here, too.

538
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Do you have a postcard?

539
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
No.

540
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
This was pretty interesting.

541
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I'll introduce it to you.

542
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
This is a person who says hello.

543
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
What's your name?

544
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Mr. Yasukawa.

545
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Yes.

546
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
I found something similar to Hamada-kun from the textbook.

547
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
This is it.

548
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
This is it.

549
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
It's similar.

550
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
The one in the front.

551
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
What?

552
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
From the left.

553
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
It's similar.

554
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
It's really similar.

555
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
It's similar.

556
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Is that so?

557
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Yes.

558
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
That's about it.

559
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
You talked a lot today.

560
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
It's been a long time.

561
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
It's been a long time since I've seen you dressed like this on our show.

562
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
It's been a long time.

563
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Really.

564
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,880
It's been a long time since I've seen you dressed like this on our show.

565
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,880
I'll do a lot of impersonations next week.

566
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Really?

567
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Yes.

568
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
What are you doing today?

569
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Shut up.

570
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Watch the show.

571

Thank you very much.

572
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Thank you very much.

573
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Thank you very much.

574
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Thank you very much.

575
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Thank you very much.

576
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Thank you very much.

577
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Thank you very much.

578
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Thank you very much.

579
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Thank you very much.

580
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Thank you very much.

581
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Thank you very much.

582
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Also today,

583
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Yes.

584
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
in the rain.

585
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
That's right.

586
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
It was difficult.

587
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Yes.

588
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Is it not gonna rain?

589
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
On Ame-no-Hi

590
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Right?

591
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I am but why...

592
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Let's have some fun.

593
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,880
If you complain about it in the rain, I don't know what to do.

594
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Let's do it.

595
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Before that, more than that.

596
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
What?

597
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I don't feel like I've lost.

598
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
You idiot.

599
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
You're still a kid.

600
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
What are you talking about?

601
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm going to be an adult and be tied up.

602
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,880
What kind of adult?

603
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Well, for the time being, that's what happened.

604
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Let's tie him up.

605
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I hope he doesn't get angry.

606
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
It was out.

607
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Please enjoy the time.

608
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,880
And do you have time?

609
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,880
As usual, I'm an assistant.

610
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
People who help me with my body.

611
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,880
I'll take a picture of the reaction.

612
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm waiting for various questions.

613
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
That's it.

614
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
That's it for today.

615
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Thank you for watching.

616
00:23:37,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Goodbye.
