1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's 6 o'clock in the morning.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What time is it?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's 6 o'clock, 11 o'clock.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today is the 11th of May.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's Hamai-kun's birthday.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I haven't had a bath yet, so I'm in a good mood.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'd like to have a birthday party with just the two of us.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Downtown's two-person birthday party.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's wrong?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's a mess.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Happy birthday to you.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now it's time for the two-person birthday party.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's time for the two-person birthday party.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's time for the two-person birthday party.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Happy birthday.

17
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Happy birthday to you.

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Happy birthday dear Hamachan.

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Happy birthday to you.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Happy birthday.

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What are you doing?

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Happy birthday.

23
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're 24 years old.

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm glad.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Happy birthday to you.

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're 34 years old, but you have a long way to go.

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Eat, eat.

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I thought you'd be a little lonely on your birthday.

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eat, eat.

30
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Happy birthday.

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Happy birthday to you.

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Cheers.

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Happy birthday to you.

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Happy birthday to you.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Happy birthday to you.

36
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Happy birthday dear Hamachan.

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you like yakisoba?

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll make it for you.

39
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What are you doing?

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Should I put in a lot of sauce?

41
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll put in more sauce than usual.

42
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have a lot of things to do.

43
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have a present for you.

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Open this.

45
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Open this.

46
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Do you want to see this?

47
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a little funny, isn't it?

48
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Eat this.

49
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's embarrassing.

50
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How is it?

51
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Go home.

52
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Do you want to play a game?

53
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No.

54
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why?

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's funny.

56
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How long are you going to do this?

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's do it again next time.

58
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Clean up the mess.

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
See you tomorrow.

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's delicious.

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing?

62
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a good timing to wake up.

63
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you don't stop the yakisoba, I'll keep saying it.

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Stop it.

65
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Stop the yakisoba.

66
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's annoying.

67
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can hear happy birthday from far away.

68
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's so far away.

69
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What is it?

70
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm singing here.

71
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know who this is.

72
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a good timing to wake up.

73
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was surprised.

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you doing?

75
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm angry.

76
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you angry?

77
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you angry?

78
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because the staff are still working.

79
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But our senior is still sleeping.

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know what to do.

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's do it.

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm in the upper room.

83
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sleeping.

84
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sad.

85
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm planning to wake up.

86
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm planning to wake up.

87
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's do it one more time.

88
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's scary.

89
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Good morning.

90
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What's wrong?

91
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Everyone is working.

92
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's hot.

93
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What's wrong?

94
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What do you want to do?

95
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Nothing.

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's hot.

97
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's hot.

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know anything.

99
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
My thighs are hot.

100
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't know anything.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know anything.

102
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What's wrong?

103
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
My thighs are hot.

104
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Where are you going?

106
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's hot.

107
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But there was someone else sleeping.

108
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Everyone is working from the morning.

109
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But there was someone else sleeping.

110
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Who is it?

111
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Who is it?

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Kenji.

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Kenji.

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He is a professional.

115
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think I'm going to drop it.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm going to put my butt on it.

117
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Be quiet.

119
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's hot.

120
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's the smell?

121
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's the smell?

122
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Good luck.

123
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's hot.

124
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's hot.

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You guys slept too much.

127
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Everyone is working from the morning.

128
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Everyone is working from the morning.

129
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Everyone is working from the morning.

130
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's finish.

131
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why are you guys sleeping?

132
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's stop.

133
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's stop.

134
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's not fashionable.

135
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not fashionable.
