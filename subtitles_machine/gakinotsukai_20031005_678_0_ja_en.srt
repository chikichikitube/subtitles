1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I've said it before, but...

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yes, yes, yes, what is it?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm still laughing at the opening song.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The staff told us to change the opening song.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I thought it would be better, but I'm still laughing.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're laughing, aren't you?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's it.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I can't go to a drink this year.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's been a while.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's been a while.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've been saying it's been a while, but you're looking at me with such a clouded eye.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's like, wow, really?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's like Romeo and Juliet.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This program is brought to you by five sponsors.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've said it before, but it's not a big deal.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yesterday, I was driving around in my car.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's really small.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's like an L-shape.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It doesn't go all the way to the end of the car.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's hard to turn, isn't it?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This corner is dangerous, isn't it?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You want to go like this, don't you?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What do you call it?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a big circle.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You want to go in a big circle, don't you?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A woman came from the other side on a bike.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
She came like this.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She was waiting for me at this corner.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, I see.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, no, no, no.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to go like this.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I wasn't angry or anything.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you don't come to me, the car is like this.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You have to get used to the car.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't do that.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Those are appropriate words.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I wanted to say that to that woman, but I couldn't.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I wanted to say that to the car's body.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I thought the car's body was strange.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Did you say that to her?

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No, I didn't.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I thought it was a body.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a beaver, isn't it?

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't care.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know if it's a beaver or not.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When you're in a hurry...

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When you're in a hurry, it goes like this.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It doesn't move at all, so I hit it and went.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, no, no.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I said, ah, it's a beaver.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I signed it.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're lying.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How many times have I signed it this year?

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's definitely a lie.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When you're in a hurry, something amazing happens.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Have you ever had a dry throat?

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's different.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Have you ever had a dry throat?

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong?

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's not that big of a deal.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why did you do that?

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When I go to the gym, something amazing happens.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It goes like this.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It happens after you exercise.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was surprised.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My hands were shaking.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My throat was so dry.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was surprised.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you're too hungry, your hands will shake.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ah.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's relaxing.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not that.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's not because you have a throat.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not like that in this day and age.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's not because you're hungry.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not that.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's because you're hungry that you feel sick.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not that.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You want to put something in quickly.

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's like this.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't take it anymore.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My wallet...

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My wallet is like a check.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I put it out like this.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I put it in like this.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I push it.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't push it and say, go down quickly.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, it's better if you drink quickly.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was doing it and it was close to me.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have a broken hand.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I pushed it and it was close.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was pushing it and it was close.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was pushing it and it was close.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was surprised and my coins went like this.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My coins went like this.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It was 240 yen.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you sure?

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll never do that!

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No no no no no!

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is true!

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No no no no no!

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What the hell!

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Ah, yo!

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Did you make the yo?

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You!

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Are you stupid?

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Only the stupid ones come out.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No no no no no no!

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That, Volvic, Volvic.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was expecting Volvic, Volvic.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
5 yen, 10 yen, 5 yen, 10 yen, and so on.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I drank 240 yen.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Are you drunk?

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're not drunk, are you?

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wait, wait.

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm not drunk.

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Shut up.

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're not drunk.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No, but it really does make a sound.

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, I don't know if you're in a hurry, but...

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have to be careful about that.

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You have to be careful.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But you don't have to eat to shake your body, do you?

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's what I do.

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But with that, um...

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I feel like the punishment for this time was a hint.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What do you mean by punishment for this time?

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They say to do it in the Japanese series.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, it could be this time.

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
By the way...

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which do you think will win?

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Me?

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think Hanshin will win.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think Hanshin will win.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Really?

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why? Do you think it's Daiei?

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
To be honest, I think it's Daiei.

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then there's no need to play rock-paper-scissors.

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's right.

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is it okay to decide that?

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So what?

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The loser will be punished.

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why?

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you say that, it's a series of why's.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I still have something left in my ass.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right, Takasu?

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, Takasu.

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, really, really.

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've been watching this on the radio.

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, I don't think so.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And Takasu said, show me.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I said, I don't have any.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And Takasu said, show me.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I said, I don't have any.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you want to see it?

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll see it.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm really gonna hit you.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I understand.

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then look at it.

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why?

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Look at it.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why?

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's just my ass.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't like it even if it's just your ass.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:28,720
And it's a little bit of a

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And it's a little bit of a

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is also a little bit.

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What are you talking about?

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's a little bit.

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, it's okay to see it.

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Then, go.

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Stop it.

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then, what kind of ass can I show?

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's enough.

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You, you, you're an idiot.

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're an idiot.

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're an idiot.

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm just saying, look at your ass.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, I don't want to see it.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm just saying, show me your ass.

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm just saying, look at your ass.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm just showing it.

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Shut up.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm just showing it.

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm just showing it.

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm just showing it.

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm just showing it.

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm just showing it.

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But why do I have to show it?

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Actually, it's the other way around.

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why do you need it?

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll show it to you!

200
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll take it!

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll give it to you!

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll give it to you, so take it!

203
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why do you need it?

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why do you want to show my butt to everyone?

205
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want you to see it this much!

206
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't want to see it!

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then look at it!

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't want to see it!

209
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know!

210
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then look at it!

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Feel my back!

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Look at it!

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like this!

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Look at it or don't look at it!

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Look at it!

216
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Look at it or don't look at it!

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then feel my butt!

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Softly!

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Softly!

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Softly!

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What are you talking about?

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Be firm!

223
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Feel my butt!

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Feel my butt!

225
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's good.

226
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You have a half-body.

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Which is better?

228
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you lose, I'll think about it.

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In the end, you don't have to decide.

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But I think you have a half-body.

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But I think you have a half-body.

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think you have a half-body.

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm surprised.

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you get infected with the most troublesome computer virus in the world, what will happen to your computer?

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you know about computer viruses?

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Something comes in, right?

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's a rough way of saying it.

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's a rough way of saying it.

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's a rough way of saying it.

241
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What will happen to your computer?

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What will happen to your computer?

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you get infected with a really bad virus.

244
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you get infected with a really bad virus.

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is similar to humans.

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What do you mean?

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What happens if you catch a cold?

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You'll get a fever.

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You'll get a fever.

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Humans.

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But what if you use electronic products for a long time?

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You'll get a fever.

253
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Humans are the same.

254
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Humans are the same.

255
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
First of all, when I came back from work,

256
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The computer that got infected with the computer virus is...

257
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's already...

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's already...

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's already...

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's already...

261
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's already...

262
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
From the top of the screen,

263
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
From the top of the screen,

264
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh, that's it.

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But now the mouse is Claire.

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It warms up.

267
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The mouse becomes a tight way.

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Which way?

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're droning

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Which way?

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's tight, now.

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The mouse...

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is the mouse.

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why is it like this?

275
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's fine.

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When you turn around, it's like this.

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're telling me a lie?

278
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's true.

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then if you have a fever, you should just go to the AC and take a look.

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's not good.

281
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That kind of person will die.

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you don't cry, you'll kill yourself. That's what Hototokisu thinks.

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I hate those kinds of thoughts.

284
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't understand this idiot.

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then how do you fix it?

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I taught you how to fix it.

287
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why are you asking such a silly question?

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then how do you fix it?

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What are you going to do if your wife is like that?

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can take it off, right?

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It feels good, it feels good.

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Are you motivated, you idiot?

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

294
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's a good example.

295
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right.

296
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's how you do it.

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, yes, yes.

298
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Excuse me, then how do you fix it?

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The heated computer.

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes, that's fine.

301
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Excuse me.

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you have a computer?

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course I do.

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If that's the case, I'll teach you.

305
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you very much.

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you have a sweater?

307
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think I have one.

308
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Cut the bottom of it into squares.

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
First, cover it up.

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's going to make a noise.

312
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's it.

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So open it up here and cover it up.

314
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, yes, yes.

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Basically, that's fine.

316
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then put it on the side.

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's going to be hard to do this all the time.

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And do you have any ginger?

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think you can find it if you look for it.

320
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Cut it up.

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can eat it.

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, me?

323
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Feel the computer.

324
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who talks to animals and trees like humans.

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mr. Matsumoto, have you ever talked to tofu?

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you have, what did you talk about?

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There's nothing I've never talked about.

328
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Tofu?

329
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Tofu and furisode.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I talked about furisode two nights.

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You've ever talked about it?

332
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Furisode?

333
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Furisode.

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What were you talking about two nights?

335
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's like this.

336
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So it was easy to talk.

337
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We usually look at each other the same way.

338
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I talked a little like a rishoku.

339
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's not easy to talk.

340
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What do you talk about two nights?

341
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
First of all, what kind of person have you been in love with?

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There was a lot of that.

343
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, furisode is fine.

344
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Have you ever talked to tofu?

345
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I have.

346
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Tell me what you talked about.

347
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You talked about tofu, didn't you?

348
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I did.

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Then tell me what it was about.

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Basically, it's all about the bad things about soy milk.

351
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you talking about?

352
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What are you talking about soy milk?

353
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can't say this on TV.

354
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I was talking about it a lot.

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Soy milk is annoying.

356
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Soy milk is annoying.

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You said it was annoying.

358
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right.

359
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's all about the bad things about soy milk.

360
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's bitter.

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's bitter.

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I was talking about it.

363
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you laugh at it?

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No, I don't laugh at it.

365
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll get angry if I laugh.

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're the one who's laughing.

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's right.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why are you laughing?

369
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There's a lot of tofu.

370
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What is it?

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There's a lot of tofu.

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you on bad terms with your parents?

373
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
My parents are on bad terms with me, too.

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What are you talking about?

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
My son says he's a bad boy.

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He's a bad boy.

377
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why don't you talk a little more?

378
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're talking a lot.

379
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's right.

380
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You're talking a lot.

381
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's right.

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's the same for everyone.

383
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto, the Indy Jones of Gotanda.

384
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who's Gotanda?

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Gotanda didn't go to the station.

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
As much as you think.

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's the only thing I'm not happy about.

388
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not as much as you think.

389
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know.

390
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's written.

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Gotanda's Indy Jones.

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's all right.

393
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

394
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Please tell me why Neanderthals are extinct.

395
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's all right.

396
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I finally got a real letter.

397
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What should I do?

398
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've been reading all the stupid letters.

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Neanderthals are really stupid.

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I see.

402
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's really stupid.

403
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is that so?

404
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What should I do?

405
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I was stupid.

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I see.

407
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't help it if I die.

408
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You were that stupid?

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I was stupid.

410
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
For example, how can you say that?

411
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What?

412
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
How can you say that?

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I was really stupid.

414
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I thought I shouldn't have pooped.

415
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm stupid.

416
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I thought pooping was the devil's servant.

417
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I see.

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's why I've been pooping all the time.

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
At home.

420
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
At home or in the village.

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It was amazing.

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Neanderthals are really stupid.

423
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I heard that I was pooping all the time.

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Neanderthals are really stupid.

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
They are old.

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They can't even poop.

427
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I said that.

428
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Everyone said that I was stupid.

429
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I couldn't do anything about it.

430
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Everyone said, get together.

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I thought I shouldn't have pooped.

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I see.

433
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You are amazing.

434
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When I pooped, everyone was looking at me.

435
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was envious.

436
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I said that.

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I said, that's good.

438
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I said, that's good.

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I said, that's good.

440
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Who said that?

441
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right.

442
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I said, that's good.

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I see.

444
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What do you mean, that's good?

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's like Haratetsuo.

446
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Come here.

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He said that.

448
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was about to poop.

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then he pooped again.

450
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There is a long history.

451
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's right.

452
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There are people who pooped before.

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's right.

454
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's why I pooped.

455
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But I was envious.

456
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's right.

457
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's all because of the bad anal.

458
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,500
Ah, is that so?

459
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
But, everyone will slap Anaru.

461
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Your Anaru...

462
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not your fault!

463
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's not your Anaru's fault!

464
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,500
Who's that? Who's that?

465
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's Chorou.

466
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,500
Ah, Chorou.

467
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,000
Chorou.

468
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Everyone, wait!

469
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Eh, wait, wait, wait.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Chorou's not waiting for that.

471
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,500
Everyone, wait!

472
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
It's not this guy's fault!

473
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's this guy's Anaru's fault!

474
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Bring me the pachinko.

475
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Bring me the pachinko that you hid from Kanete.

476
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
There's no need to hide it!

477
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Where did you put it?

478
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
There's no need to leave it there.

479
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Bring it to me.

480
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Chorou's a bit big.

481
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,000
The ball?

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,500
The ball.

483
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
The village guy's ball is this small.

484
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,000
Wait!

485
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Here it comes!

486
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
This is my big ball!

487
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
It's not your fault!

488
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
I've been telling you!

489
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
It's your Anaru's fault!

490
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
I know that, that's why everyone's doing it!

491
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Here I go.

492
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay.

493
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
E, R, San.

494
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
What are you doing?

495
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
That was, that was a terrible thing to do.

496
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
You don't eat it much, right?

497
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
If I eat it, it'll come out.

498
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
If you eat it, it'll come out.

499
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
No, that's not it.

500
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
What I'm asking is why you're asking if it's rotten.

501
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
If it's rotten, I know that you think it's bad.

502
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I know that Anaru's saying bad things and doing this.

503
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Why?

504
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
I want to destroy it.

505
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
What?

506
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I want to destroy it.

507
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
That's right.

508
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
What's right?

509
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
You'll destroy it.

510
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Why?

511
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
First, you can't eat it.

512
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Yes, yes, yes.

513
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
If you don't eat it as little as possible, the devil's servant will do it.

514
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
That's right.

515
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
You can't use the devil's servant.

516
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
That's right, that's right.

517
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
If you have small hands, it'll look like that.

518
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
It'll look like that.

519
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
That's a terrible thing, if it looks like that.

520
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
That's right.

521
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
That's why everyone should eat as little as possible.

522
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Right?

523
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
In the end, you can't eat anything.

524
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
No, that's not it.

525
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
What I'm asking is why you're increasing the number of ancestors.

526
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Yes, yes, yes.

527
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Right?

528
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Yes.

529
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
No, but...

530
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
This is what I'm talking about.

531
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
No, it's not.

532
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
You can do it while holding back your poop?

533
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Right? That's what I'm saying.

534
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
But you have to eat as little as possible.

535
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Yes.

536
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
What are you going to do about this?

537
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I don't know.

538
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
And the child that's born will be like,

539
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
The baby will be like,

540
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It'll come out like this.

541
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
You just did it.

542
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I won't forgive you even if you're a baby.

543
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
You hid it after it was born.

544
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
It'll come out like this.

545
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
That's right.

546
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
There's a way.

547
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Let's just leave it there.

548
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
You don't have to hide it.

549
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
It's not your fault.

550
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
No, it's Anaru's fault.

551
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
It's not your fault.

552
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I know that. I know that.

553
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Mine is a big ball, so I'll hold back a little.

554
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
That's what I'm saying.

555
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Bang!

556
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
And then the child, right?

557
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
It's too small.

558
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
You can't react to that, can you?

559
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
I see.

560
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
It's a real problem.

561
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It's amazing.

562
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
That's why you died?

563
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
It's amazing.

564
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
It seems that everyone came out of nowhere at the end.

565
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,500
It's a dirty story.

566
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I see.

567
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
I don't really want to hear about it.

568
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,500
If that's the case, I'd like to hear more about Choro.

569
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Do you want to hear about Choro?

570
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Actually, I'll tell you now.

571
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Choro was silent to everyone.

572
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
That's right.

573
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
I can't stand it until I'm that old.

574
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Where do you do it?

575
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Everyone woke up at 7 o'clock tomorrow and said, I'm going to sleep.

576
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,500
By the time everyone fell asleep.

577
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Bang!

578
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
It's amazing.

579
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
There's a lot of boiled eggs.

580
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Boiled eggs.

581
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,500
It's like Neanderthal.

582
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
That's right.

583
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
That's why it's connected to the opening.

584
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
What is it?

585
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,500
It's not good to put up with it today.

586
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Yes, yes, yes.

587
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
If you put up with the thirst of your throat, you'll drink 220 yen.

588
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Yes, yes, yes.

589
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
That's what happened, isn't it?

590
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
I didn't drink it.

591
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Do you want to say it again?

592
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
You said you drank a lot.

593
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I didn't drink that much.

594
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
What kind of 220 yen do you think 220 yen is?

595
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
What do you mean?

596
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I think it's 220 yen in total.

597
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't think it's 220 yen for two 100 yen bills and two 10 yen bills.

598
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Oh, is that wrong?

599
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,500
One 100 yen bill, two 50 yen bills, two 5 yen bills, and one 10 yen bill.

600
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
And the number of bills changes completely.

601
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
No, but you didn't drink it.

602
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
What I drank was very fine.

603
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
It's even finer.

604
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
There was 5 yen in it.

605
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,500
If you don't write that down at all, you're saying 220 yen, two 100 yen bills, two 10 yen bills.

606
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
I can't forgive you for that.

607
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,500
But it's not your fault.

608
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,500
It's your own fault.

609
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:12,500
This program was brought to you by five sponsors.
