1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Gaki no Tsukai's famous show, Hichihenge

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Up until now, there have been 19 heroes who have challenged

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Despite being under a lot of pressure, their sense of humor, acting ability, and courage have been tested

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Some have cried, some have cried

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And tonight, this man will challenge Hichihenge

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who will it be?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikichiki, Chihara Yasushi, Hichihenge!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Chihara!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Eh?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Seiji!

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come here!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come here!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wow!

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow!

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, this time

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's amazing

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're acting weird!

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I am!

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not!

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I just came from home!

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's nothing weird about it!

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What is this?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good style!

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This time, it's the 20th person

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ah, the 20th person

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Bob Sapp is a bit...

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, I'll do it so I'll aim for it

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Really?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But!

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Even though it's low, it doesn't mean that I'm not funny

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why?

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The result

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Of course

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Even if it works, the next one is Junior

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ah, I see

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sorry, in a few months

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, please

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Junior has already changed three times with the power of medicine

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's true

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What will it be like?

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know if everyone will laugh or not

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's true

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Really

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's like an occult movie

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not funny at all

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When I was filming

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The cursed dog came and looked at me twice

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He looked at me and said, what?

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What should we do?

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What should we do?

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What should we do?

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's amazing that we're facing each other

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What does that mean?

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dauntaro-san will show his face

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And he will choose between the younger or the older

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ah, I see

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He will choose

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes, yes, yes

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, I'm fine with it

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He will definitely be chosen

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How many people will be chosen?

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How many?

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What should we do?

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Tanaka, do you want to try it?

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ochi musha, wakahage, erogappa, suichu

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you going to do with this?

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I used to do it with Jin-san

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, yes, yes

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You almost died

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, yes, yes

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't want to do it

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't want to do it

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Really?

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What should I do?

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What should I do?

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What should I do?

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is this for real?

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What should I do?

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is this for real?

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I haven't been to the gym lately

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can't do it

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't do it

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can't fit in here

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've been to the gym for a while, but I don't know much about it

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, what should I do?

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If I don't do it right, it won't end

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What should I do?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What should I do?

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What should I do?

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When I was making the second one, I did it with a roll

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It took too much time

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you don't give me an opinion, I'll let someone else do it

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll do it at that meeting

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't do it

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't do it

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can't do it

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Should I call him a human dog?

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's good, isn't it?

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't stand up on my own as an old man

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll give you a piggyback ride

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Excuse me

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Please give me a piggyback ride

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Please give me a piggyback ride

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you crying?

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you crying now?

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not crying

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are you crying?

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not crying

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're not crying

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's go over there

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Excuse me

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Please

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Are you crying?

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you crying?

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not crying

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you crying?

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not crying

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you crying?

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm not crying

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm not crying

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not crying

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have to do my best

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The first impact was a big explosion

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I thought it was bad

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I felt it

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That face

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There's no place to throw it away

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But it's true, isn't it?

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's definitely my fault

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's definitely my fault

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's definitely my fault

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's definitely my fault

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's definitely my fault

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You'll be surprised

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's definitely my fault

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why is it my fault?

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What should I do?

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's definitely my fault

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's definitely my fault

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What is it?

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can only imagine

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's definitely my fault

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's definitely my fault

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's definitely my fault

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's definitely my fault

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I endured it

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's obviously coming out of the water

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's coming out of the water

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What is it?

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That hat

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, this is the way

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is that so?

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's the way

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Subi Subi-chan!

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hey, hey, hey! Wait, stop! Don't move!

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Stay right there!

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Subi Subi-chan!

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Subi Subi-chan!

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Subi Subi-chan!

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Subi Subi-chan?

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Subi Subi-chan?

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Subi Subi-chan?

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Subi Subi-chan?

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Subi Subi-chan!?

172
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Subi Subi-chan?

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Subi Subi-chan?

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Subi Subi-chan?

175
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What's up, Arotea?

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Damn, you're here.

177
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
When you're hanging on the wall, you look like Marco from Agnese Bay.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There's a door next to the hallway.

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes, that's right.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You did well.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's still dark.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello? Akira?

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you here now?

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No way, everyone's here.

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay, I got it.

187
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah.

188
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Wait a minute.

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Are you watching now?

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah.

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm watching.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm being watched.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm doing it.

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm doing what you told me to do.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, I'm doing it.

196
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, I'm watching.

197
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I got it.

198
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is pretty good.

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Did you get it?

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I got it.

201
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I got it.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I got it.

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
40,000 yen and 3,000 yen.

204
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Wow, that's amazing.

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you very much.

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's amazing.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But...

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What is it?

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't want to do this.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm serious.

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What?

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you dreaming lately?

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't dream.

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Once in a while, I have a really big dream, but when I woke up the other day, I laughed so hard.

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The moment I woke up, I was like, hahahaha!

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Was it that fun?

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It was amazing!

219
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You were in it too!

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What?

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It was a dream, so I was a bit dazed.

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But that was probably in middle school.

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It felt like middle school.

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Everyone was like, get together!

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It was me, Hamada, Ito, and Wada.

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I was gathered with 5 people I'd never seen before.

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And there was this scary person who said, get together!

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I think it was Adachi-sensei.

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ah, I see. I'm really sorry.

230
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I get it, I get it.

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I think it was that model.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And they said, you guys are too messy.

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You guys are messing up the atmosphere.

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So you have to choose one of you guys, and you have to die today.

235
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That was sudden.

236
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's right.

237
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Normally, I'd be like, well, whatever.

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But it was a dream, so I was like, I see.

239
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Right?

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then they told me to announce the winner.

241
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I was like, first of all,

242
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Say!

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's how you decide?

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Say!

245
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I was like, yeah!

246
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's how you decide?

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah!

248
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're going to get killed.

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The other 4 didn't care.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah!

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And in the end, Ito and you were going to die.

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why?

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Really?

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then, this is where it gets interesting.

255
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why did you say there was only one?

256
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Ito and you.

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Just the two of us?

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know why, but it was just you and Ito.

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then we decided to go to the infirmary.

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So the guy who was going to get killed was going to the infirmary?

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, and then they gave us an injection.

262
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They gave us an injection, and 30 minutes later, we were super sleepy.

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So they told us to go to sleep, and that was it.

264
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then Ito and you were like, what?

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They gave us an injection.

266
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And we were like, don't be so depressed.

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And then we went to the park.

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We still had time.

269
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So the 5 of us went to the park.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And out of nowhere, 5 guys from Kusamura showed up.

271
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And they were like, who the hell are you guys going to kill?

272
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And we were like, whoa!

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And we were like, whoa!

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And then we looked at Ito and you, and this is what happened.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We were about to die!

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We were about to die!

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And unfortunately, I woke up.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And I was like, whoa!

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Isn't this dream amazing?

280
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You didn't watch it until you died, did you?

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It was really funny.

282
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I mean, why are you guys fighting?

283
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We were about to die!

284
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We were doing this, but...

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So you're pushing this?

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I can imitate Taketsu-san.

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Taketsu-san!

288
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why are you pushing the staff?

289
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I want to do it!

290
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What's the difference between Careless Smith and Aerosmith?

291
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What's the difference between Careless Smith and Aerosmith?

292
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They're exactly the same.

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Doesn't that make any difference?

294
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They're exactly the same.

295
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They're completely different.

296
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Aerosmith?

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Do you know Aerosmith?

298
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Who is Aerosmith?

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He's in a band, right?

300
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's right.

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Careless Smith?

302
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's Careless Miss.

303
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The leader of Careless Miss.

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You don't know Gaitare, do you?

305
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't.

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's rude.

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I've heard of Aerosmith.

308
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The name, Aerosmith.

309
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know.

310
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I've heard of Careless Miss.

311
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They're exactly the same.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a different name.

313
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's not a different name.

314
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Back in the days of the Indies, it was Careless Miss.

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It became a major name?

316
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It became a major name, Aerosmith.

317
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then it's Kaenri!

318
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I used to do it in front of a department store.

319
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Gaitare, right?

320
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I used to do it in front of a shop.

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then it's Gaitare, right?

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I used to do it in front of a shop!

323
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I used to come and do my best.

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I stayed in front of Teichiku's eyes.

325
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Teichiku?

326
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're only going to Teichiku's eyes?

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't say that!

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're going to Teichiku's eyes!

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're going to get in trouble!

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I was going to debut.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But I didn't have the punch.

332
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I went with Aerosmith.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The leader, Careless Smith, didn't like it until the end.

334
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The name, Kaenri.

335
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The name, Kaenri.

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We've always done it like this.

337
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We've always done it like this.

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Gaitare, right?

339
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I've been to Tohoku!

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You've never been in Tohoku, though?

341
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I've never been to Tohoku, though?

342
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm traveling here these days.

343
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's go and see Careless Smith, shall we?

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ok, if it's not real, we're going to see it.

345
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Really.

346
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What if it's not real, then—

347
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's definitely going to be someone.

348
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
A strong challenger.

349
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He's going to give you electric gender事情.

350
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is that right?

351
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Rock.

352
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Me?

353
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why are you calling your partner rock?

354
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Careless Miss is rock?

355
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Careless Miss is not rock

356
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's not rock? Then what is it?

357
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Acapella

358
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then it's not a band

359
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's not a band

360
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why?

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's a cappella

362
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's not a band

363
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What do you want to know?

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You're going to see Careless Miss, aren't you?

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Aren't you going?

366
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm going, so what is this?

367
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's Two Days

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What do you know?

369
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You're saying something I've never heard before

371
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's Three Days

372
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Which is it?

373
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If you say something good, it's Three Days

374
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
For the time being, it's Two Days. Try it

375
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I was listening to what you were saying

376
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Then your cell phone rang

377
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Careless Miss

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was wearing it

379
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Your cell phone rang and you said, I'm sorry

380
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Why did you sit down?

381
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's not like you're with a woman

382
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm a caretaker, so I said, I'm sorry

383
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Then I went to the front door

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, try it on the second day

385
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
DVD 4th edition is about to be released

386
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The last of the four months of release

387
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's a masterpiece talk that includes an unpublished scene that couldn't be broadcast on TV

388
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
In addition, the 15-year confrontation and punishment game will be released

389
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Please look forward to it
