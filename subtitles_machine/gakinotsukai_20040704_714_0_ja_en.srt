1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Everyone!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I have a letter for you.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What is it?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's from a mother in elementary school.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll read it to you.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Nice to meet you, downtown kids.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I am a mother with a son who is in the second grade.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My son is playing baseball in the Little League.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But he had a fracture before his first official game.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He is very depressed because he lost his regular seat.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My son's name is Minoru Okada.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Minoru is a big fan of Gaki no Tsukai.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I watch his videos every week.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Would you please cheer for him?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's from a mother named Kiyoko.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm moved.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He is a fan of Gaki no Tsukai.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I hope we can cheer him up so that he can play baseball again.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm moved.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've never been so moved.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The hospital is nearby.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's go to the hospital.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you very much.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is a hospital.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you for coming.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My mother gave me a letter.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's from Edo, isn't it?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, it's from Edo.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I hope we can cheer him up so that he can play baseball again.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He is a big fan of Edo.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is that so?

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I watch his videos every week.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is that so?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here are some flowers.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you very much.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is amazing.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's beautiful.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you very much.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I heard that you are playing baseball.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes, we are.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Really?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good luck.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you very much.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Can I open it?

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, please.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Open it.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I wonder what it is.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I wonder what it is.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm looking forward to it.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a globe.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's done.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you very much.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're welcome.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm glad.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The end.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can you sign it for me?

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Of course.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Can I?

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You are a big fan of Edo, aren't you?

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'd like to ask you for this.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a treasure of Minoru.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is from a long time ago.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How did you get it?

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Did you buy it on TV?

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, I bought it.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you selling it now?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's called Dynamite Shikoku.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I see.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wow, it's Edo's signature.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's my Edo's signature.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Edo's signature, isn't it?

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, it's not.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm glad.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm glad.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's getting better.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's getting better.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you so happy that you bought it?

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What should I do?

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Can I ask you something?

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is Edo's favorite character, Hohohoin.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is that so?

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's enough that you bought it.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you can, can you cheer him up with your Hohohoin?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, it's okay.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you okay?

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Please.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Are you okay?

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's been a long time.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please do it in your usual outfit.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can't do it in this outfit, can I?

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You look good in your usual outfit.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you want to see Emi-no-roko?

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, I do.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Really?

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, then...

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, then...

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have this, too.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Please use it if you like.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're actually wearing it, aren't you?

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, please.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Please.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't help it.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll take this and use it.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then, I'll get ready.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm a big fan of Edo.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm glad.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I like Edo.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's rare.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's rare.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right.

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm glad.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Today is a good day, isn't it?

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you ready?

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes, I'm ready.

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll be around here.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Minoru-kun, please get well soon.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Please get well and do your best in baseball.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please get a regular.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Please.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Please do it.

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Minoru-kun, please get well soon.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Minoru's smile is amazing.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm glad.

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm glad.

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you very much.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's about time.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you.

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Please do your best.

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please do your best.

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Actually, I wrote a letter to you.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Actually, Minoru has been depressed since she had a fracture.

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because of that, she couldn't sleep well.

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I see.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
At the Hollywood audition of Mr. Endo,

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you imitated Takeshi, didn't you?

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you show that in the video,

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you'll sleep better.

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll sleep better?

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Since Mr. Endo came here today,

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
can you imitate Takeshi in front of Minoru's eyes?

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What should I do?

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The doctor said that if you don't sleep well,

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you'll get better late.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That may be true.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please do it.

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
After this, I'll record it.

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you understand?

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please do it.

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm glad that you'll do it, Minoru.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I did it.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can see Takeshi today.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can see him.

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's the matter with Takeshi and Minoru?

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're going to sleep soon, aren't you?

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you for always supporting me.

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to sleep now.

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to sleep.

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Please do it.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Dan-kun!

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Dan-kun!

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dan-kun, you bastard!

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Get out of the car, Dan-kun!

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why aren't you turning?

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Are you sleeping again?

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Get out!

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Get out!

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're going to sleep naked.

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Stop it!

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Turn the car, Rakkyo!

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Which one do you want?

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Turn the car, you bastard!

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why are you like that?

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I told you to turn the car, Rakkyo.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Turn the car, Dan-kun!

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why aren't you turning?

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're sleeping, you bastard!

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why are you like that?

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Turn the car!

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Turn the car!

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Turn the car!

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why are you like that?

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Tell me why you're sleeping.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,540
Turn the car,

208
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,000
rottenunno!

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,960
You're sleeping, this爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛

210
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Come on! Come on!

211
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Come on!

212
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Hurry up and put your pants on!

213
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Hurry up and put your pants on!

214
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
What the hell are you doing?

215
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
What's with that look in your eyes?

216
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
What the hell are you doing?

217
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
If you're going to run away, then don't do that!

218
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
You idiot!

219
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
What the hell are you doing?

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
What are you doing?

221
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
What are you doing?

222
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm always here!

223
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Hurry up!

224
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
I'm always here!

225
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Aren't you?

226
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm always here!

227
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Taka!

228
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Taka!

229
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Taka, come on

230
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Hurry up and get out of here!

231
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Come on, Taka!

232
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Hurry up and get out of here!

233
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Hurry up and get out of here!

234
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Tell me something, you idiot!

235
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
You can't say anything, you idiot!

236
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
What the hell are you doing?

237
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,960
What's wrong with you?

239
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Why are you here?

240
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
What's wrong?

241
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,960
What's wrong?

242
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,960
What's wrong?

243
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Tell me, Rakkyo.

244
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
What are you doing?

245
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Rakkyo!

246
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Rakkyo, what's wrong?

247
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,960
What's wrong, Duncan?

248
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,960
What the hell are you talking about?

249
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Mori! Mori!

250
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Mori, come here!

251
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,960
You're the one who made me angry!

252
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Why do you want me to turn the car?

253
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Why don't you turn it?

254
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Hey!

255
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Don't do it!

256
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I said don't do it!

257
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,960
What the hell are you doing?

258
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,960
What the hell are you doing?

259
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,960
I said don't do it!

260
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Hey!

261
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Someone turn the car!

262
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Why do you want me to do this?

263
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I said turn the car!

264
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Don't do it!

265
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I said turn the car!

266
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
I said turn the car!

267
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,960
What the hell are you doing?

268
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,960
What the hell are you doing?

269
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Hurry up and turn the car!

270
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I said turn the car!

271
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,960
What the hell are you doing?

272
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,960
What the hell are you doing?

273
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Taka! Taka!

274
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I said come here!

275
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Turn the car with Taka Drusher!

276
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Hurry up and turn the car with Taka Drusher!

277
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I said turn the car with Taka Drusher!

278
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Why don't you turn the car?

279
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,960
What the hell are you doing?

280
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I said turn the car!

281
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,960
What the hell are you doing?

282
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,960
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Turn the car!

284
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
I said turn the car!

285
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Are you a witness?

287
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Are you a witness?

288
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Are you a witness?

289
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
What the hell are you doing?

290
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
I said turn the car!

291
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Hurry up and turn the car!

292
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
What are you doing there?

293
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Turn the car!

294
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,960
There is a big car!

295
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Hurry up and turn the car!

296
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,960
What the hell are you doing?

297
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Turn the car!

298
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I said turn the car!

299
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Hurry up and turn the car!

300
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Why don't you turn the car?

301
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,960
What the hell are you doing?

302
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
What are you looking at?

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Why don't you turn the car?

304
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Why don't you look at me?

305
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Why don't you look at me?

306
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Why are you looking at me?

307
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Tell me!

308
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Why don't you look at me?

309
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Why are you acting like that?

310
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Why are you like that?

311
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Turn the car!

312
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Let's go!

313
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,960
The band that Mr. Matsumoto used to work with, the blood-soaked handsome boy, was one of the members.

314
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
What kind of member was he?

315
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,960
For example, if you ask for his name, there was someone who said, there was that person?

316
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
What?

317
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
If you ask for his name, there was someone who said, there was that person?

318
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Of course, of course.

319
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Really?

320
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Of course, of course.

321
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Well, the members were active separately, so I don't really want them to say it.

322
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Ah, I see.

323
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Yes.

324
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
It was a bad past, wasn't it?

325
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Well, it was a bad past, so I don't know.

326
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I see.

327
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Then, tell me.

328
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Well, there was a boy from L'Arc-en-Ciel who was a vocalist.

329
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
You did it together, didn't you?

330
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I did.

331
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Say his name.

332
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
What's a vocalist's son?

333
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
You don't know even if I say it, do you?

334
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Why don't you just say his name?

335
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Well, I called him by his real name.

336
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Ah, then you can say his real name.

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Sasada.

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Ah, so Sasada was the vocalist?

339
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
No, Sasada was the vocalist.

340
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
I was the vocalist.

341
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Because he was the most handsome boy.

342
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,960
He had a voice like a peeled egg.

343
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
That's not funny.

344
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
What was Sasada doing?

345
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Sasada was a guitarist.

346
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
A guitarist?

347
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Which one?

348
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
He was a bassist and a guitarist.

349
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Say it.

350
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Say it.

351
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm a bassist and a guitarist.

352
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Say it.

353
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Say it.

354
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I'm a bassist and a guitarist.

355
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Say it.

356
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I'm a bassist and a guitarist.

357
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
You're the vocalist.

358
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm the vocalist.

359
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
What about the others?

360
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Eh?

361
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
I was the most handsome boy.

362
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
What about the others?

363
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Amamiya Ryo.

364
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
That's old.

365
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
That's old.

366
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
That's old.

367
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
No, no, no.

368
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
I was an electric guitarist.

369
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
I was a synthesizer.

370
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Which one?

371
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I was an electric guitarist and a synthesizer.

372
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I was an electric guitarist and a synthesizer.

373
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I can't say it.

374
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
What was it?

375
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Amamiya Ryo.

376
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
I was an electric guitarist and a synthesizer.

377
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Everyone is different.

378
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Then what?

379
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Even if I'm lying, I have to say what everyone knows about the members.

380
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,960
My memories have to be changed into what you all know.

381
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Please tell me the others.

382
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Who was the singer?

383
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Amachi Shigeru.

384
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
I was an electric guitarist.

385
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
That's old.

386
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
That's old.

387
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Then what?

388
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Even if I'm lying, I have to say what everyone knows about the members.

389
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,960
My memories have to be changed into what you all know.

390
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
That's what I have to say.

391
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Vocal, bass, guitar.

393
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Who was the drummer?

394
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
The drummer was Kato Go.

395
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
The tambourine was Tani Hayato.

396
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
That's right.

397
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Right?

398
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
You're always in front of guys.

399
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,960
You should definitely put Kato Go in front of guys.

400
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Matsumoto-san has done a scene-stealing game three times before.

401
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Where did he do that?

402
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:19,960
He was standing in front of a ramen shop with a long line of people.

403
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,960
That's when I finished my scene-stealing game.

404
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
That's it for today.

405
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
That's it for today.

406
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
That's when I did my first scene-stealing game.

407
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
What kind of situation was that?

408
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Who did you do that to?

409
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
That was the ramen shop owner.

410
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
To the owner.

411
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
That's it for today.

412
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
He apologized to me.

413
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,960
That's when I did my scene-stealing game.

414
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
What does that mean?

415
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I don't know what that means.

416
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Can you do it again?

417
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,960
What happened to your father when you did that scene-stealing game?

418
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,960
The scene-stealing game...

419
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
was terrifying!

420
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I think that's it.

421
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
I still have two more scenes to do.

422
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
You did three scenes?

423
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
That's right. I didn't forget.

424
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Then I'll do two more.

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
What did you say?

426
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
The scene-stealing game...

427
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,960
If you say it like that, I'll do the fourth scene today.

428
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
No, no, no.

429
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
You can't do it for me.

430
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
You can't do it for me.

431
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
You can't do the scene-stealing game.

432
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
I can't do the scene-stealing game for my partner.

433
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I can't see the picture of your scene-stealing game.

434
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Where did you do the second scene?

435
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
It's an old story.

436
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
The first scene was when I was in the second grade of elementary school.

437
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I did the scene-stealing game for an old lady at a restaurant.

438
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Why did you do the scene-stealing game for an old lady?

439
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,960
I took the leftovers to the restaurant.

440
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,960
I was told that I left a lot of money.

441
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
I see.

442
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
I didn't leave the money.

443
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I took the leftovers to the restaurant.

444
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
At that time, I was very angry.

445
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I was very angry.

446
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
What?

447
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
What did you say?

448
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I was very angry.

449
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
That's dangerous.

450
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
You shouldn't be angry.

451
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I was scared.

452
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I didn't say I was scared.

453
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
But I was angry.

454
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
That scene has already been shown.

455
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Where?

456
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
When I went to the violence room.

457
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I don't know.

458
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
How old were you?

459
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I was 19 years old.

460
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
And?

461
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,960
I drank two glasses of water.

462
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I was told that I had 500,000 yen.

463
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
I was paid 500,000 yen.

464
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
That's right.

465
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
After that, I got angry.

466
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
I got angry.

467
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I was told to pay 500,000 yen.

468
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,960
I took out a piece of paper from my wallet.

469
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
I took it out.

470
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I took out a piece of paper from my wallet.

471
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I took out a piece of paper from my wallet.

472
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Can I tell you the truth?

473
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Can I tell you the truth?

474
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Yes.

475
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I had a lot of fun until the end.

476
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Why is it like this?

477
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Why?

478
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,960
I don't think it's a good idea to write a letter.

479
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Why did you take out a piece of paper from your wallet?

480
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

481
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I couldn't see what it was.

482
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
It was just an old man and an old woman's reaction.

483
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
After that, I took out a piece of paper from my wallet.

484
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Everyone was surprised.

485
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I was eating in front of my eyes.

486
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
After that, I took out a piece of paper from my wallet.

487
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
I see.

488
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,960
My reaction was different from everyone's reaction.

489
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
It was different.

490
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Do you think it's a good idea to write a letter?

491
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I think it's a good idea.

492
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I think it's a good idea to write a letter.

493
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm sorry.

494
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I think it's a good idea to write a letter.

495
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I think it's a good idea to write a letter.

496
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
What?

497
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
I see.

498
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
I can't write a letter now.

499
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
I've been asked to write a letter.

500
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
What do you want me to write?

501
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
I want you to write a letter.

502
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I have a letter.

503
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
You don't have a letter.

504
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I have a letter.

505
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
You can't write a letter now.

506
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I have a letter.

507
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
I have a letter.

508
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I didn't expect you to write a letter on the stage.

509
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
So I always leave it to you.

510
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
You can write a letter now.

511
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I don't think you can buy sesame dumplings while we're talking.

512
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It's not sesame dumplings.

513
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
What is this name?

514
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
It's a letter.

515
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
It's a letter.

516
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,960
There was no Japanese confectionery shop nearby.

517
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
What?

518
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
There's a letter here.

519
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I have a letter.

520
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I have a letter.

521
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I have a letter.

522
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
I don't care.

523
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
I have a letter.

524
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I have a letter.

525
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
I have a letter.

526
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
I have a letter.

527
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I have a letter.

528
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
I have a letter.

529
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:27,960
You ate it again.
