1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you know where we are today?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We are in front of a Buddhist temple.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are in Tawara-machi today.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Tawara-machi.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Asakusa is right there.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've been there before.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As you can see behind me, there is a Buddhist temple.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the Buddhist temple you mentioned earlier.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There are many Buddhist temples about 1 km away.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's called the Buddhist temple street.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So it's safe to say that this is the Buddhist temple street.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's...

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's a long story.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
From the temple.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I see.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Look at the name of this shop.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What is it?

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I just happened to see it.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hamada Shoten.

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hamada Shoten.

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Right.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They're doing bad business.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's the same here.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right.

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's all the same.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Look at this.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's closed.

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's like when Umekawa was arrested.

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's like the Mitsubishi Bank.

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well...

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's been a while since I had oden there.

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What? Oden?

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oden.

37
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Radish and egg.

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And my father's love.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I heard something earlier.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They're doing bad business.

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is the 5th floor.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That supermarket over there.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Where are you going, old man?

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What?

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Where are you going?

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm done for today.

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Idiot.

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Idiot.

50
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Idiot.

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We don't have any money.

52
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We don't have any money to pay the children.

53
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's on the 5th floor.

54
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can try asking around at Place 24.

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's the plan.

56
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Enjoy until the end.

57
00:01:39,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This program is brought to you by Sanraku, Toyosui-san, and Oyama International Products.

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please come this way.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good evening.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Good evening.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Today's guest is famous.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why?

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Today is the 9th day.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The 9th day?

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, today is the 9th day.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The most uncooperative guest.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why?

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't know what makes you laugh.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, no.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He has been working hard until now.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really?

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know why you say that.

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The weather is bad today.

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't think everyone is in a good mood.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, you got a watch today.

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What?

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bandai or something.

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I got a watch.

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
An Ultraman watch.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, yes, yes.

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't need it.

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, yes, yes.

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who is the 26-year-old man?

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't need it.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I threw it away.

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't need it.

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't need it.

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm grateful that this program is popular.

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
These days, TV is not interesting.

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's being pushed to movies.

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Really?

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Video is the same.

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can watch movies on rental.

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But there is no Japanese movie.

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't like it.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
These days, there is no Japanese movie.

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You like it.

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There are a lot of movies that I liked.

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Really?

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I used to watch a movie called Ogata Ken Shuen.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I was impressed.

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was impressed.

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
KAI.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a difficult word.

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know if I should write it.

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know if I should write it.

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't like Japanese movies.

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know the meaning of the title.

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't want to watch it.

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know what KAI means.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But it's Ogata Ken Shuen KAI.

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And there is a Ketsu on it.

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why?

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What kind of movie is Ogata Ken Shuen KAI?

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's funny.

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There is a Ketsu from Ogata Ken.

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's over when the blood comes out.

119
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You are stupid.

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've been writing Ketsu all the time.

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What do you mean it's over when the blood comes out?

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
KAI is interesting.

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't like the title.

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There is also YASHA.

125
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Takakura Ken.

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
YASHA.

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yakuza movie.

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
YASHA.

129
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Takakura Ken Shuen YASHA.

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know the meaning of YASHA.

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But there is a KANAWANYO on it.

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's WA-SHA.

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WA-SHA and KANAWANYO.

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's an action movie.

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think it's a good movie.

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Takakura Ken Shuen WA-SHA and KANAWANYO.

137
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What kind of movie is it?

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's funny.

139
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There are many strange movies these days.

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But the title is interesting.

141
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What is strange?

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Orgol.

143
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Orgol.

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's Tsuyoshi Nagaguchi.

145
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Orgol is the first main character.

146
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want to watch it.

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What kind of movie is it?

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What kind of movie is it?

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's RURUGORU.

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right.

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is a picture of the stupid Tsuyoshi.

152
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He is saying,

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I want to go!

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He is eating the butter.

155
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He is eating the butter.

156
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
RURUGORU?

157
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is RURUGORU?

158
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't want to watch that movie.

159
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't want to watch that movie.

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'd like to watch it if it's a movie.

161
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But I think the radio is more interesting.

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The radio is interesting.

163
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a child's phone call.

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He's quite popular.

165
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He doesn't listen to his friends.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He doesn't understand what his friends are saying.

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He doesn't listen to his parents.

168
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He calls them.

169
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hello?

170
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hello?

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What?

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He was busy.

173
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That happens sometimes.

174
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hello?

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hello?

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hello?

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What's wrong?

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hello?

179
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Be quiet!

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's like a phone call for a child.

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hello?

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You speak too fast.

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't talk to me like that.

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
A little more.

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A little smaller.

186
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hello?

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello?

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello?

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hello?

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's your name?

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Matsumoto.

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's your name?

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sato.

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sato?

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's your name?

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Matsumoto.

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Matsumoto?

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Matsumoto?

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's your name?

201
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sato.

202
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sato?

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sato?

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sato?

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Matsumoto?

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

207
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Matsumoto?

208
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Where's Sato?

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's the meaning of that?

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Matsumoto Sato.

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Matsumoto is your name?

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is ridiculous!

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't think of me like that!

215
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's the meaning of that?

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why didn't you say Sato?

225
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why didn't you say Sato?

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hello?

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What's wrong?

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have something to ask.

229
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's why you called me.

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm a Buddhist monk.

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What?

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why are you concerned about children?

233
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't care what you are.

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I want to know what you are.

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ask me something child-like.

236
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're a Buddhist monk.

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why are you worried about this?

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to know something more.

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Something child-like.

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hello?

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes?

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know how to say it, but it tickles my tongue.

243
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe I should drink some water.

244
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What should I eat?

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Ask your mother!

246
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't call me all the time!

247
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you do that, your mother will be angry!

248
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If you want to say something, just say it.

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What are you doing?

250
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's better to ask your mother.

252
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to ask something childish.

253
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's a good question.

255
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's my first time.

256
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Say it again.

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

258
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's not a neck.

260
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't call me a giraffe.

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't want to call you a giraffe.

262
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A giraffe's neck is very relaxing.

263
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's why you can't wait for a snack at 3 o'clock.

264
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's why it has a long neck.

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's true.

266
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's true.

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's true.

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Who is the turtle?

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm not a turtle.

270
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm a bear.

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not a bear.

272
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm a turtle.

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What?

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm a snake.

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm a bear.

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm a bear.

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you talking about?

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm a woman.

279
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you talking about?

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're a elephant.

281
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're a fool.

282
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you say such a complicated thing, I'll be in trouble.

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm a child.

284
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're a man.

285
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Brrrr.

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hello? I'd like to ask you something.

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What do you want to ask?

288
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm a stone.

289
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A stone?

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No one calls a stone.

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A stone?

292
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Brrrr.

293
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hello? I'd like to ask you something.

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm a fax machine.

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A fax machine?

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why do you call a fax machine?

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hello?

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hello?

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hello?

302
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hello?

303
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'd like to ask you something.

304
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What is it?

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm a child.

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm a child.

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm a fax machine.

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'd like to ask you something.

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What is it?

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm...

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sorry. A fax machine just came in.

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm waiting for a fax machine.

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why don't you play the recorder?

315
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't use Kachiyo!

316
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We're talking politely to each other!

317
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hello? What's up? It's Onii-san.

318
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is it okay?

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes, it's okay.

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is Kachiyo okay?

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's okay.

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hello?

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes, what is it?

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You know...

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

326
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have something I want to ask you.

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, yes, yes.

328
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How can a baby be born?

329
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Ah, I see. How can a baby be born?

330
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

331
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A baby is born.

332
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ah!

333
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What kind of phone call is that?

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
A baby is born?

335
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's not how it works.

336
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you mean by a baby is born?

337
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What?

338
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you mean by a baby is born?

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Think of a way to say it!

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're talking to a child on the phone.

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You should say, a baby is born!

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You should say, a baby is born!

343
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You shouldn't say that.

344
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You should ask something childish.

345
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Childish?

346
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Childish.

347
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hello? What's up?

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hello? Onii-san?

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

350
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I have something I want to ask you.

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

352
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How can a baby be born?

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hmm.

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's a great question.

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is it a great question?

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Onii-san is very tired.

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see.

358
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

359
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How can a baby be born?

360
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's right.

361
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is a very difficult question.

362
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is that so?

363
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So, Onii-san, I'm going to look it up.

364
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't hang up. Wait.

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Ah, yes.

366
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll be out soon.

368
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes.

369
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Wait for me.

370
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Does he know the answer?

371
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I think he doesn't.

372
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think he doesn't know the answer.

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How much longer?

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
How much longer?

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't hit me!

376
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Shut up!

377
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hurry up and play!

378
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hurry up and play!

379
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is a very difficult problem. Can you wait a little longer?

380
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry!

381
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll wait.

382
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's already fallen.

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Can you wait a little longer?

385
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It disappeared!

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is the first time you've seen a new story on TV.

388
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Everyone doesn't understand this tension.

389
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You can't experience it for the rest of your life.

390
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm an amateur.

391
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I said this before, but it's like you're driving for the first time and getting a license and getting a high speed.

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're good.

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know if I'm good or not.

394
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's like that.

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have a sense of tension.

396
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's hard.

397
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know how to react.

398
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I've never done it in front of anyone.

399
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm in a very bad condition physically.

400
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yesterday in Osaka, the radio was over, and today I came here by car.

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It took seven hours.

402
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The manager was already out, but no one came home.

403
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
My butt hurts.

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

405
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Your butt.

406
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It hurts!

407
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Suddenly I'm like this.

408
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I saw your butt.

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Even if I can't see it, I can't see it.

410
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You're sick.

411
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're doing the ultimate choice in the middle of the car.

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Choice?

413
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Ultimate choice.

414
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Speak clearly.

415
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Which one do you choose?

416
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't have a name.

417
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You don't have a name.

418
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't have a name called Hamada Masatoshi.

419
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No one calls me.

420
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They only call me Oi or Kimi.

421
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Even my mother calls me Masatoshi.

422
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They only call me Anta.

423
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't even call the woman I like.

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't have a name.

425
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Even the manager doesn't know my name.

426
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because you don't have a name.

427
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's right.

428
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Also,

429
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have a name called Piyo Piyo-man.

430
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I knew it.

431
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Piyo Piyo-man.

432
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I wouldn't have known if I didn't have a name.

433
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There are a lot of cool scenes with that name.

434
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
When I become a crab in a mental video, I look cool, right?

435
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No, you don't.

436
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You look cool even in a hospital waiting room.

437
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
When you go to the doctor, you say,

438
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Piyo Piyo-man-san.

439
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Even then, if you wait in the waiting room,

440
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
it's better than being called Oi.

441
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey, you there.

442
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hey, you there.

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Right?

444
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It happens in traffic accidents.

445
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There are a lot of things that happen.

446
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In traffic accidents.

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You crash your head.

448
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You crash your head.

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You can't see the whole machine.

450
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You can't see the whole machine.

451
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There's no spare machine.

452
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No one has a spare machine.

453
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There's no spare machine.

454
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You're covered with a transparent mat.

455
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's a machine.

456
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's a machine.

457
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You can't see the whole brain.

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You crash your head.

459
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You can't see the whole brain.

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You have a hat like a ping-pong ball.

461
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You drew the bear's picture.

462
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And you have a ball.

463
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh, that's right.

464
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're a ping-pong ball.

465
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're a bad-looking guy.

466
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can't stop thinking about everyone's brainwaves.

467
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When I think of something, I can't stop thinking about it.

468
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, he's thinking of something now.

469
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And when I exercise hard, I can't stop thinking about it.

470
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm going to introduce a little bit.

471
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry, Akiyo.

472
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why did you catch a cold again?

473
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, I caught a cold.

474
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't go home today.

476
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I can't go home right away if I catch a cold.

477
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm going to introduce a little bit.

479
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm Masami Takatani from Chiba prefecture.

480
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Good evening, Masumoto-san.

481
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you for your hard work every time.

482
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There is a saying that there is a different way of saying the word eat on the radio.

483
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There are only two people who eat.

484
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There are only two people who eat.

486
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll give you a little bit of food.

487
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's the same for girls.

488
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I gave you a little bit of food yesterday.

489
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I gave you a little bit of food.

490
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why are you so quiet?

491
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know if it's a little different from Osaka-pen.

492
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's candy.

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Candy ball.

495
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What do people say about this?

496
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you call it candy?

497
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What do you call it?

498
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Just candy?

499
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Do you eat candy?

500
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't have candy, but I don't eat it.

501
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I can't say I don't eat it.

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I can't say I don't eat it.

503
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Osaka is different.

504
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There's a candy in Osaka.

505
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Candy-chan.

506
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You think this is a lie, don't you?

507
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Really?

508
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's true.

509
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is definitely true.

510
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not just young people.

511
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Old people are overbearing, too.

512
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's right.

513
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There was a yakuza last time.

514
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
He's got a lot of eyebrows that look like they're going to break.

515
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll give you a punch.

516
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
A yakuza came and said,

517
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I caught you candy-chan.

518
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's true.

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's true.

520
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You're lying!

521
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's really candy-chan.

522
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you have any relatives in Osaka, ask them.

523
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's not really a lie.

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The poop is also called poop-chan.

525
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's true!

526
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's true.

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's true.

528
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is also true.

529
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's true, right?

530
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is true.

531
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Everything is chan?

532
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Everything is chan.

533
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What else is there?

534
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Huh?

535
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Ame-chan.

536
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Ame-chan, right?

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Poop-chan.

538
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Huh?

539
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is...

540
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hama-chan.

541
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This is...

542
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is match-chan.

543
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Huh?

544
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is te-chan.

545
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is match-chan.

546
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's obvious that it's poop-chan.

547
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Touching dirty things.

548
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Everyone runs away.

549
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
This is true.

550
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is true, right?

551
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is true, right?

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is true, right?

553
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is true, right?

554
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Right?

555
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What is this?

556
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Huh?

557
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Huh?

558
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
En-gato.

559
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
En-gato?

560
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
En-gato?

561
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
En-gato?

562
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
En-gato?

563
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What was Osaka again?

564
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oi.

565
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Huh?

566
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Bebenjo?

567
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Bebenjo?

568
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This is...

569
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This is too dirty.

570
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Bebenjo, Kanjo, Kage, Shimeta, right?

571
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Which one is better?

572
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Kansai.

573
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Kansai, right?

574
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Bebenjo is better.

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Bebenjo is better.

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Bebenjo is better.

577
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This one is dirtier.

578
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There's a coffee shop, right?

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
When you go to a coffee shop,

580
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
what do people ask you to do?

581
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
In Osaka, they ask you to eat char siu baku.

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
When you go to eat gyudon.

583
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
When you go to eat gyudon, do they ask you to eat gyudon?

584
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's interesting.

585
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
In Osaka, they ask you to eat gyu shi baku.

586
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Gyu shi baku.

587
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Gyu shi baku.

588
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Gyu shi baku.

589
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Today, we'll ask these two questions again.

590
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We'll ask them to answer.

591
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's right.

592
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Today, we'll ask them to answer.

593
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Here we go.

594
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When you go to a coffee shop?

595
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Char siu baku.

596
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
When you go to eat gyudon?

597
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Gyudon.

598
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sick of it.

599
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Gyu shi baku.

600
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I can't go home.

601
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's right.

602
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's do it again.

603
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
When you go to a coffee shop?

604
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Char siu baku.

605
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
When you go to eat gyudon?

606
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Gyu shi baku.

607
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What about this?

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Gyu shi baku.

609
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's right.

610
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's all for today.

611
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Goodbye.

612
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you.

613
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That was fun.

614
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You know,

615
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't like it when people misunderstand me.

616
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But next week,

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm thinking of doing a comedy show.

618
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What do you mean?

619
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Why did you get misunderstood?

620
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You know,

621
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't like it when people misunderstand me.

622
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's not like that.

623
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's not like that at all.

624
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's not like that at all.

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It can't be helped.

626
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You're right.

627
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You know,

628
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we've been talking all the time.

629
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Right?

630
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We don't use our bodies

631
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
so much in the free talk.

632
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's why people who are watching

633
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
think of us as lovely people.

634
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It seems that the opening

635
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
will be canceled next week.

636
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Really?

637
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm so happy.

638
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It was hard in the rain.

639
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's amazing.

640
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's so cold.

641
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It'll be much easier if it's canceled.

642
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It'll be easier.

643
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can concentrate on the next time.

644
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's all.

645
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's all for today.

646
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Goodbye.
