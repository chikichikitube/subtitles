1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Kono Music

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Kono Music

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's Kono Music

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is this, suddenly

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is this, suddenly

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is this, suddenly

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's pretty much the same

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's pretty much the same

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I also want to rehearse

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I also want to rehearse

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I also want to rehearse

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I also want to rehearse

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Music start

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to dance

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What are you doing

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't say it

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm doing my best

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't say it

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm laughing

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's fun

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's not a tree

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's written

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I see

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's hard to be a choreographer

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Merry Christmas

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's almost over

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Today

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
2005 Gaki no Tsukai

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Funny VTR

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Best 10

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you mad?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not mad

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This year

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
8 years in a row

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I was chosen

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Downtown manager

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My name is Kojiro Koryuki

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's cut

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not cut

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What is this?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's the most important part

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not cut

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's stop here

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not cut at all

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's broken

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There were many good things

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Downtown's DVD

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The DVD

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
1.5 million

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's amazing

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't imagine DVD

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Kojiro

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is this?

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You have a good reaction

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There are not many people

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
who can make a good reaction

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in Hamano's room

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Today

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We have a special member

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
New face

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you there?

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why are you there?

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please tell me

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Help me

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Someone stop this bus

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This program

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is sponsored by

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the sponsor

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Slowly

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's dirty

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you tear this

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I see

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is a success

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a success

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's me

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's me

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's me

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's amazing

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's broken

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's broken

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Stop

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You have no right

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now, Yamaram, it's time for you to go to sleep.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She came here on purpose, right?

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I was working with Kona, but what was that?

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's going on?

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's going on?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yamaram...

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's going on?

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yamaram suddenly became quiet.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's going on?

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yamaram...

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Good night.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll do my best like this.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A big event once a year, the celebrity fishing competition.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This year, five guests gathered in Kawaguchiko.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They want to catch a giant black bass and have a serious fight.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This time, Eguchi-san couldn't participate due to work.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Next year, we'll be waiting for you.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The winner is Matsumoto!

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Matsumoto wins!

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is the fourth time in two years.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's a lot.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I haven't seen this.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Really?

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hamada, the boy who works as a waiter, gets the members involved.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A heavy metal band, Souseiki, is formed.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And the practice is almost over.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Souseiki is Misato's...

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why did you do that?

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's too much.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is this?

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What is this?

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is the worst.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is the worst.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is the worst.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm addicted to Souseiki.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm laughing so much that I'm going to faint.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're a fool.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're a complete fool.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I love it when Hamada-san is suffering.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Everyone in the family is laughing.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please hug me.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Can I take off the lever?

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The enemy's loyalty is 100%.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The enemy's loyalty is 100%.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The miracle lever fortune teller, Piccadilly Umeda...

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The miracle lever fortune teller, Piccadilly Umeda...

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
...kills the members with a dangerous prophecy.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He kills them.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The prophecy about Matsumoto is...

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
...that if he doesn't get married this year, he'll die.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The studio is filled with tension.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What advice did Piccadilly Umeda give to avoid this?

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The prophecy about Hamada is that he's in danger of divorce.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
To prevent this, he tells his wife that he loves her once a day.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is where Endo's line came from.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think everyone will agree.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Shouldn't you say his name?

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't have to say his name.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a joke.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a joke.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a joke.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a joke.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Chiaki.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I love you.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Itao has been asking for money since he appeared on the show.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This time, he came to sell the format of the quiz show.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This week's quiz has started.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a quiz between his wife and Itao.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's a quiz between his wife and Itao.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's a quiz between his wife and Itao.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The Itzy dance has started.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Everyone, please give your answers.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Say safety, safety, Yamazaki-san.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Safety, safety.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yamazaki-san, safety, safety.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He has been completely locked up.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please sit down.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Please sit down.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please sit down.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's 1,100,000 yen.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And the assistant's wife won for some reason.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He has been asking for money and the format of the show.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's here.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you going home, wife?

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I didn't have that idea.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No, it's different.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course it's different.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's different.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's different.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
While playing a game on the bus, they go around the city.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
However, the winner of the game has to kiss Madonna who is waiting for him at the destination.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Who is Madonna?

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The first one is Kochouran Abeko.

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Who will be the loser?

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What is it?

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Abeko!

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's here.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The size of her face is different.

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The next Madonna is Tsubaki Funako from Mahaha Honpo.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The game resumed with 6 people other than Matsumoto.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Who will be the next loser?

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Shinji!

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Shinji!

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Who will be the next loser?

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Matsumoto.

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's me.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Wow, it's amazing.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is the most difficult.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is the most difficult.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can only see the salaryman.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
10 years couple.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Tanaka's kiss is decided in the last game, Kokon Tozai.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Who will be the last Madonna?

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Madonna.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's Mimata.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's Mimata.

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's a fierce face.

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a fierce face.

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's here.

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's here.

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's hard.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's different from here.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's different from here.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's a separate place.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's a separate place.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Look at this.

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a separate place.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a star that I gave birth to.

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's right.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why do you two work together?

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's amazing.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's from here.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The third place is the project that encouraged the boy who was left alone in the room.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Murayama Toinichi will be appointed as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Japan.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Everyone will have their opinions.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can't do that.

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is he an actor?

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's an actor.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mr. Murayama will be appointed as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Japan.

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There is a party in here.

225
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He's happy.

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This was a long time ago.

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm not going out anymore.

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
End! End!

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
End!

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hide! Hide!

231
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Join! Join!

232
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Join!

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hide! Hide!

234
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What are you doing?

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What are you doing?

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What are you doing?

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Suddenly, in the form of the western police, Daimon, the Suga chief producer appeared.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because one person alone is not enough, he told the other members to decide in the game.

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The staff and the talent challenged various games, and one person was taken away with another person.

240
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Finally, the 5 people of the western police were decided.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm hungry.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Right hand, right?

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a pot.

244
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a pot.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I see.

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I see.

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Most people with black eyes appeared, right?

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I wanted it to be like that

249
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Is it 1st place?

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know

251
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know which one is 1st place

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Downtown

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't underestimate it

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is it

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is it

256
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is it

257
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Inoue and Maa are the ones who are going to play football

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The end of this year

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Wait a minute

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Wait a minute

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Who did you lose to?

262
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You

263
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Who did you lose to?

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Who?

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is

267
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yaman is laughing

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He's laughing

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He's laughing

270
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's laughing

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was behind Endo

272
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I was behind Endo

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I only stretched my legs

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I only stretched my legs

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I only stretched my legs

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Excuse me

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's it

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's it

279
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's it

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's it

281
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Isn't that it, you?

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Isn't that it, you?

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know

284
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think Endo said a lot

285
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't know

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Actually, he said a lot

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Endo

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Endo

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a bad guy

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Finally, the prank has reached its climax.

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay.

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Thank you for your hard work.

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Thank you for your hard work.

294
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you for your hard work.

295
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't know what to say.

296
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I feel like I'm going to be licked.

297
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I feel like I'm going to be licked.

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Should I go?

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, it's okay.

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I think they think it's me.

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Why?

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think they think it's me.

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
For some reason, he declared that he was the culprit.

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Kohori goes to Hamada's dressing room.

305
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What did Hamada show in the climax of the prank?

306
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Excuse me.

307
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Excuse me.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I feel like I'm going to be licked.

309
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I feel like I'm going to be licked.

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I feel like I'm going to be licked.

311
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Kohori.

312
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Kohori.

313
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What are you doing?

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What are you doing?

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you drunk?

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm not angry.

317
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're not angry, but you're going to hit me like that.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Next, he calls out to Iwao, who doesn't know anything.

319
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What will happen?

320
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What are you doing, Iwao?

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What are you doing, Iwao?

322
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
In the end, Hamada himself hits the dressing room where the other three are.

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You guys are different.

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey.

325
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You guys are different.

326
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey.

327
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's useless.

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's useless.

329
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's useless.

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's useless.

331
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It was a great face.

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What's wrong?

333
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What's wrong?

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's wrong, Goto?

335
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What's wrong, Goto?

336
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's wrong, Goto?

337
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
In addition, he makes another prank on the late Karate face target.

338
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This time, all five young people are the target.

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Matsumoto is angry.

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's right.

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Irie is angry.

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't be angry.

343
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:36,260
And as planned, the riot begins with the beginning of the Hanataba

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And as planned, the riot begins with the beginning of the Hanataba

345
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Everyone is running away.

346
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They're all running away.

347
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Stop it.

348
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Stop it.

349
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You can't do that here.

350
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm not tired.

351
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Stop it.

352
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You need to take off your mask.

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If I take off my mask, I'll be laughed at.

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:03,280
In the same order as before, they gradually drive the Karate face into the fear of the

355
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
They gradually drive the Karate face into the fear of the

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And Matsumoto 마지막 attacks tão

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And finally Yabe goes to Matsumoto's dressing room to apologize.

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
They lose Yabe.

359
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yabe comes andarsi, Yabe leaves.

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan

361
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Obe-san

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yabu-chan

363
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
In the end, Matsumoto goes to Irie who doesn't know anything

364
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan

365
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan, Yabu-chan

366
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What's wrong?

367
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because it was really scary

368
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Who were you?

369
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Aoi

370
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Aoi

371
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I see

372
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I see

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is interesting

374
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It is

375
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But the image of downtown is really bad

376
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's not that scary

377
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's just that Kokoriko is being teased

378
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I heard it during the meeting

379
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Kokoriko might go a little

380
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If you don't go a little, you might get caught

381
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I thought it was ok

382
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not a little at all

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Everyone was beaten up during my time

384
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm sorry

385
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
How many times did you get beaten up?

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry

387
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Lastly, we will say goodbye while watching this

388
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Everyone, have a good year

389
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Thank you

390
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What is this sound?

392
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
No matter how you look from here, it's a hard game

393
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can't move at all

394
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is not good for this program

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This program was brought to you by the sponsor of this program
