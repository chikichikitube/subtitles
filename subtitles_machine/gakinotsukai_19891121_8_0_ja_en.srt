1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Today I came to a great place.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
I'll go around from a great place.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Today I came to Jujyo station.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Behind that is Jujyo station.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Do you know that these two stations are in Saitama?

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
I see.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Everyone's cheeks are red.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Mr. Komewarashi.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Mr. Komewarashi.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I can laugh.

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
No, it's not.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
It's good.

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
It's not good.

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
It's not good.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
It's not good.

16
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
It's true.

17
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
It's not a joke.

18
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
I'll bring this.

19
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
It's true.

20
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
It's true.

21
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
What is it?

22
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Let's have a talk.

23
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Please.

24
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
If you're buying rice,

25
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Kunimatsu.

26
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
What?

27
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Kunimatsu.

28
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Kunimatsu.

29
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
What?

30
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Cut it out.

31
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
We're at Jujyo today.

32
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Shinohara Engeijo.

33
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,500
The theater of Mr. Komewarashi was here a while ago.

34
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
The playground.

35
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:05,500
In fact, there are still people who are acting here all the time, but they can't go out for us now.

36
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Because they are staying here.

37
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Is that so?

38
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm really sorry.

39
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Well, let's do it here all year round.

40
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
There is no place to stay.

42
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
This is great, isn't it?

43
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Great.

44
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,500
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

45
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Let's do it in front of the audience while sitting on the tatami mat.

46
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I think it's the first time.

47
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Let's go to the dressing room.

48
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Thank you very much.

49
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I'm going to wear it.

50
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm going to wear it.

51
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm going to wear it.

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
This program is a product of Toyo.

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Ooyama International Product

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Sponsored by Sanraku

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
This is the eighth time today.

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Today is a great day.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Today is a great day.

58
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
You guys are laughing a lot.

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
You laugh in the theater before you see the story.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Today is worth working hard.

61
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
If you work hard, I think you'll get a twist.

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I think you'll get a twist.

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
That's great.

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Aren't you a little tired?

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
I don't know if I'm a little tired.

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
The atmosphere of the atmosphere is not enough.

67
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
But if you gather like this, there are people who have bad feet.

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
You have to be careful.

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Today is the eighth time.

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I've done it eight times.

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I've already stopped doing it last week.

72
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I've already stopped doing it.

73
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I said I'd do it again on the sixth time.

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I said I'd do it again on the sixth time.

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
But when I think about it, there's no joke.

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
I've already stopped doing it.

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I'll do my best today.

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I'll do my best today.

79
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I don't know what to do next week.

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I've been to Tokyo and Osaka.

81
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Osaka's power is still not enough for Tokyo people.

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Osaka's power is still not enough for Tokyo people.

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Osaka's power is still not enough for Tokyo people.

84
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Osaka's fans are amazing.

85
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm a little out of it.

86
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I'm a little out of it.

87
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
So we're in Tokyo now.

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I think I ran away from Osaka's fans.

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm scared.

90
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm scared.

91
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm scared.

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
If I'm not good, I'll be in trouble.

93
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I've been a little out of it.

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Especially when I first started, I didn't know what to do.

95
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
You too, Mr. Rotarin.

96
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
The phone was terrible.

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
It was terrible.

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I got a phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning.

99
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
I picked it up and saw a pipe organ on the other end of the phone.

100
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I was surprised.

101
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
The phone was real.

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm sure it was a rich girl.

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
I was surprised.

104
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
I bet you're playing it in a big house.

105
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
I bet you're playing it in a big house.

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
When I hung up the phone, I thought it was out.

107
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
But I didn't know it was playing.

108
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I was surprised. I thought he was a death-ler.

109
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
You idiot.

110
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Really.

111
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
He's a death-ler.

112
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
It was disgusting.

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I was wondering what would come next.

114
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
I called him again.

115
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
It was even more disgusting.

116
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
What?

117
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
He was reading the holy book.

118
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
In the middle of the night?

119
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Yes, he was reading the holy book.

120
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
It was disgusting, but I wanted to ask him.

121
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
But if I asked him, he would hit me with a bat.

122
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
What?

123
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
It doesn't matter.

124
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
I closed my eyes and asked him.

125
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
It was disgusting.

126
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
He was very serious.

127
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I didn't mean to call him.

128
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I asked my friend if he was serious.

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I wanted to confirm it.

130
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
You didn't confirm it yet.

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes.

132
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I wanted to confirm it.

133
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He said his name was good.

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I asked him if he was a fan of Yamada.

135
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
If he was a fan of him.

136
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I asked him if he was a fan of him.

137
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
He said no.

138
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I asked him who he was.

139
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I didn't know who he was.

140
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I asked him if he was a fan of Yoko.

141
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I wanted to confirm it.

142
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I asked him if he was a fan of Yoko.

143
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
He said he was a fan of Harada.

144
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I see.

145
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
He was like this.

146
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Wait.

147
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
You said it before, didn't you?

148
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
He said he was a fan of Harada.

149
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I asked him what he was.

150
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I was surprised.

151
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I thought it was not true, so I asked him if he was a fan of Harada.

152
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
He said he was a fan of Yoko.

153
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I asked him who he was.

154
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
He said he was a fan of him.

155
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,500
He said he was a fan of Yoko.

156
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,500
He said Yoko-san, but what you said was Yoko.

157
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
I changed my phone number.

158
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
What I did next was, I sold telephones.

159
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
You didn't have a phone number to contact.

160
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
On the contrary, you knew the address, so you sold telephones.

161
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I sold telephones.

162
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I sold telephones.

163
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
If I didn't have a phone number, I came to the telecommunications office.

164
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I said that I received a message, and I changed it.

165
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
You received a telecommunications message.

166
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Yes, so please call me when you come back.

167
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I received a message.

168
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I came back.

169
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
I left it there, so I called the telecommunications office.

170
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Hello, I received a telecommunications message.

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Oh, are you Matsumoto-san?

172
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Yes, I will read it, so please wait a moment.

173
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
He is about 50 years old.

174
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
I waited a moment, and I came back.

175
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Yes, I will read it now.

176
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
I love Matcha.

177
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Ufufufu.

178
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I read it.

179
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Such a middle-aged man says,

180
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I love Matcha.

181
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Ufufufu.

182
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I'll send it to you.

183
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
No, no, no.

184
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
And the one who takes things.

185
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
This is the worst.

186
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
It's called business in Tokyo.

187
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
We call it Yogyo.

188
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Yes, yes.

189
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
We go to the countryside, right?

190
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
For example, we go to supermarkets like Daiei.

191
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Yes, yes.

192
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
And we play games and go home in front of everyone.

193
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Yes, yes.

194
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
If that happens, there will be people who are still standing.

195
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
We come to the station home, right?

196
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Yes, yes, yes.

197
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
When we go home, we steal things that people are wearing.

198
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Yes, yes.

199
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
For example, if you wear sunglasses on your chest,

200
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
we steal it.

201
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Wow!

202
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
You are a thief.

203
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Yes, I am.

204
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
And the one who takes things.

205
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
If you lose to a crowd,

206
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
you try to break your thumb.

207
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
What are you doing?

208
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
What do you mean by that?

209
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
What are you talking about?

210
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
When I was on TV,

211
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
you said,

212
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I had a fracture.

213
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm glad you said that.

214
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I was there.

215
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I don't want you to do that.

216
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Last year, when I went to Himeji,

217
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I took a new pair of sunglasses.

218
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Yes, you took a new pair of sunglasses.

219
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
You said, this is only Kota.

220
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Yes, I said that.

221
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I took a new pair of sunglasses and ran away.

222
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Normally, I would give up.

223
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
But they were expensive sunglasses.

224
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I said, wait a minute.

225
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I was embarrassed.

226
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I said, wait a minute.

227
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
I took a new pair of sunglasses and ran away.

228
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You are lying.

229
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
You are lying.

230
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
No, I'm serious.

231
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
You stopped like this.

232
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Yes.

233
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
You said, this is only Kota.

234
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
I said, wait a minute.

235
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
I said, wait a minute.

236
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
You said, Mr. Balma fell.

237
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
There are such things.

238
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Yes.

239
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
There are many people in Osaka.

240
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I came to Tokyo.

241
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
When I see people in Tokyo,

242
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
they have a great sense of fashion.

243
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
They are different from us.

244
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
It's great.

245
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Boys are thinking about fashion.

246
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Yes.

247
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
They are fashionable.

248
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
When I was a student,

249
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
there were only three patterns.

250
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
There are three patterns of clothes.

251
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Yes.

252
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
IB, Yankee, and Saffron.

253
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Yes.

254
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
There were only three.

255
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I had to choose one.

256
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
But it was difficult at that time.

257
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Yes.

258
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I had to choose IB.

259
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I had to choose IB.

260
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
If you were in the middle, it would be cool.

261
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Yes.

262
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
You could be looked down on.

263
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Yes.

264
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I had to choose IB.

265
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I had to choose IB.

266
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I had to choose IB.

267
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I had to choose IB.

268
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I had to choose IB.

269
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I had to choose IB.

270
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I had to choose IB.

271
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I had to choose IB.

272
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I had to choose IB.

273
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
There was no such a time.

274
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
There was no such things as food.

275
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
No other things.

276
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I had to mix home made ¡¬.

277
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It was IB.

278
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
¿¬

279
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
It seems that the things we eat are массive.

280
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
I don't know why.

281
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
What?

282
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
It were not all IB.

283
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:36,820
I have to

284
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Why are you eating it when it's cold?

285
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
You're eating it from the top to the bottom with the I.B.

286
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
That's not good!

287
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
That's not good, I.B. eating it from the bottom to the top!

288
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
That's not good!

289
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
It's delicious!

290
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
That's not good.

291
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
What do you drink?

292
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
What do you eat with I.B.?

293
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Do you eat it from the bottom to the top?

294
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
I.B. eats popcorn.

295
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
You can't decide that!

296
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
What's popcorn?

297
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
What do you drink with I.B.?

298
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
What do you drink with I.B.?

299
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
You can't decide that!

300
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Why do you drink cola?

301
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Surfer is difficult.

302
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
What's difficult about surfer?

303
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
I don't know what to eat.

304
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Surfer is amazing.

305
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
You look healthy.

306
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
You don't get sunburned.

307
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
If you have a weak body, you look cool when you're on the wave.

308
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm working out.

309
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I don't have thick arms.

310
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
I have muscular legs.

311
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
I have muscular legs.

312
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
I have muscular legs.

313
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Muscular legs?

314
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Muscular legs?

315
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
What are muscular legs?

316
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
When you see universities, you see catfish-like feet.

317
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,820
You see catfish-like feet.

318
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
I've heard this.

319
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Catfish-like feet!

320
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
I have 컨tacted feet with catfish-like feet.

321
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
What are you talking about?

322
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
You're the one who said it!

323
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
You're the one who said it in the live stream!

324
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
You're an amazing guy!

325
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
You can't say it one by one, right?

326
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
You're like Kamoshika's foot!

327
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm like a lizard in front of the town.

328
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
If you say that, I'm like a lizard's face.

329
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
You can't say that from here!

330
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
You can't say that one by one!

331
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
No one says Kamoshika's face from here!

332
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
You can't say that one by one.

333
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Then what do you eat?

334
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
What do you eat?

335
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Sea food.

336
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Are you stupid?

337
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
What's sea food?

338
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
What's sea food?

339
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,820
There's a lot of things like Korot.

340
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Who doesn't know?

341
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
You don't know Korot, right?

342
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
It's the oil of a whale.

343
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
The top is black and the bottom is white.

344
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,820
It's like a sponge, don't you know?

345
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,820
You don't have to eat it.

346
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
What do you drink?

347
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
What do you drink on the surfboard?

348
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Drink sea food.

349
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,820
What do you drink on the surfboard?

350
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
It's called seawater.

351
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,820
What do you drink on the surfboard?

352
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
The most difficult thing is to be a Yankee.

353
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Everything is difficult to be a Yankee.

354
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
You have to be a Yankee around you.

355
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
You have to be a Yankee from your family.

356
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
It's not good to be a Yankee.

357
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
You're usually alone with your family.

358
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Why is your family like this?

359
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,820
My mother was a Yankee.

360
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,820
My mother was different from a Yankee.

361
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
She was short-tempered.

362
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
She was a Yankee.

363
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
She was short-tempered.

364
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
She was a Yankee.

365
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm sorry.

366
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
I'm sorry.

367
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm sorry.

368
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
She was a Yankee.

369
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Your mother was short-tempered.

370
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
She was a green aunt.

371
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Her father was a green uncle.

372
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
I was a Yankee in elementary school.

373
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,820
I went to my mother after my father passed away.

374
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
I was scolded by my father.

375
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
My mother said,

376
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
This is strange.

377
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
This is strange.

378
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Why is my mother a Yankee?

379
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
My mother was a Yankee.

380
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
I was scolded by my father.

381
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
My father was a kind man.

382
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
He was a Yankee.

383
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
My mother was a green aunt.

384
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
She was short-tempered.

385
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
My mother was a green uncle.

386
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
She was short-tempered.

387
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
My mother was a green aunt.

388
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
She was short-tempered.

389
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
She was a green aunt.

390
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
What is your name?

391
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
What is your name?

392
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
Let me tell you something.

393
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
I cut my hair at first.

394
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,820
Then my bangs fall down.

395
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
My bangs fall down.

396
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
It's annoying.

397
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
My bangs fall down.

398
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
It's a little annoying.

399
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Then my bangs fall down.

400
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
I went to the hospital.

401
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I became a sports person.

402
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
How long have you been doing this?

403
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
About 10 minutes.

404
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
You've been doing this for about 10 minutes?

405
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
About 10 minutes.

406
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,820
What is this?

407
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
The fan letters that you get from fans in Osaka and Tokyo are cold.

408
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Really?

409
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
How is it?

411
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
The fan letters from fans in Osaka, for example, if you write a phone number,

412
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
they write, it's okay to call, so please do it.

413
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,820
In Tokyo, they write a phone number and say, you can do it.

414
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
That's great.

415
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,820
It's a bit of a high-profile type of fan letter.

416
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Let's introduce the fan letters today.

417
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Is there anyone here who has been in a relationship with Ashii-san?

418
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Yes.

419
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
You're such an honor student.

420
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Oh, you've been in a relationship?

421
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Oh, is that so?

422
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Are you studying or not?

423
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Everyone knows that you have a girlfriend.

424
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Oh, is that so?

425
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
You have a girlfriend, right?

426
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
I don't have one.

427
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,820
It was taken, but it doesn't matter.

428
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Is there anyone in Mach-chan?

429
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
This is really...

430
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,820
How can I get a girlfriend?

431
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I want a girlfriend.

432
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Really.

433
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
That's great.

434
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
No, no, no.

435
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
What's great?

436
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Really.

437
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Really?

438
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
I don't have anything to say anymore.

439
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
I really want a girlfriend.

440
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Why don't you have one?

441
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Why don't you have one?

442
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
I wonder why.

443
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Huh?

444
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
After all...

445
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,820
I don't have a chance to know.

446
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
So I'm thinking of sleeping with her next time.

447
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Oh, that's...

448
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,820
I'm thinking of sleeping with her next time.

449
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I'm having a lonely night.

450
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
I heard from you.

451
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Normally, when you go to a disco, you go dancing, right?

452
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
I don't dance well, so I can't go.

453
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Well, for the time being, I'm dancing like this.

454
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Can I really say that?

455
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
No one dances like this.

456
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Well, well.

457
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I'm dancing like this.

458
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
I usually dance.

459
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
No.

460
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I'm sitting down.

461
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I go back to the back.

462
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I smoke while wearing glasses.

463
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Really?

464
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Really?

465
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
I'm Kinji Sawada.

466
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,820
I'm a back-up dancer.

467
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Everyone is dancing in the middle.

468
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
I smoke while dancing.

469
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I go to this place where I'm dancing.

470
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
And if I don't like it, I go to the next place.

471
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Like this.

472
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Like this.

473
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
What?

474
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
What?

475
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Such a guy.

476
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Such a guy.

477
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Such a guy.

478
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Such a guy.

479
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Such a guy.

480
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
From bottom to top.

481
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Such a guy.

482
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Such a guy.

483
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Such a guy.

484
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Such a guy.

485
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
I never dance like this.

486
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I don't like it.

487
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
I want to know человек abomen.

488
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Let me teach you Osaka dialect.

489
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Yes, please.

490
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Everyone did it.

491
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
A person from Tokyo.

492
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
You put some words we use in our speech,

493
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
for example,

494
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
if you watch TV drama,

495
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
there are a lot of things we don't understand.

496
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
For example,

497
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,820
Torihada.

498
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,820
You have a sword in your hand!

499
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,820
What's so funny about Torihada?

500
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Torihada, eh?

501
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Osaka Torihada is...

502
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Torihada...

503
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
I'll say it, but...

504
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Don't say it too much.

505
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Osaka is...

506
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Sabuibo.

507
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
This is...

508
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
That's why...

509
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Don't say zoku zoku zoku!

510
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,820
For example, if an old man touches you, you say zoku zoku zoku, right?

511
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
You say something like Sabu, right?

512
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
And then you say something like Sabuibo.

513
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Just like that!

514
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Sabuibo.

515
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
I don't say this.

516
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Also, you see...

517
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Osaka's Marudachi is...

518
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
That's it.

519
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
If a child goes waaaaah!

520
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
I don't know what to say about this, but...

521
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
If a child goes waaaaah!

522
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
You say, I-chibirina!

523
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
I-chibiru.

524
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I-chibirina.

525
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
You say, I-chibirina.

526
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
You say, I-chibirina.

527
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,820
If you're in the house, you say, I-chibirina!

528
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
I-chibirina, I-chibirina!

529
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Tokyo's mothers are kind, right?

530
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
You say, I-chibirina.

531
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,820
You say, I-chibirina.

532
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
Osaka is different, right?

533
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Osaka is...

534
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,820
You say, I-chibirina!

535
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
You can't say it right away.

536
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
If you're angry, you go waaaaah!

537
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
You say, I-chibirina!

538
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
No, seriously.

539
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Seriously, right?

540
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
You put out your hand, too.

541
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
You put out your hand, too.

542
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
You say, I-chibirina!

543
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Osaka's mothers are easy to get excited.

544
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Osaka's people.

545
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
You can't tell the difference on the way.

546
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,820
If you do that, I-chibirina!

547
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
Osaka's mothers are easy to get excited.

548
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
You can't tell the difference on the way.

549
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,820
If you're angry, you go, I-chibirina!

550
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
I-chibirina!

551
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
You say, I-chibirina.

552
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
You touch it, I-chibirina.

553
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Osaka's mothers are easy to get excited.

554
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,820
If you're angry, you go, I-chibirina!

555
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Also, what Matsumoto-kun often says is about poop.

556
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
It's in the middle of the night, so it's fine.

557
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
I didn't know about this at all.

558
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
I thought it would work here, too.

559
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
Is poop poop here?

560
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Well, poop is poop.

561
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
You can't call it that.

562
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
No, it's different.

563
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Osaka is, you know, baba.

564
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Yes, yes, yes.

565
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,820
I was a kid before, and when I said baba, it didn't work.

566
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

567
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
It's called baba.

568
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
There's something called baba, right?

569
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
That's the name.

570
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,820
That's poop.

571
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,820
Osaka says baba, so I say, hello, I'm baba.

572
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
It's true.

573
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
No, seriously.

574
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:14,820
It's not that strange now, but when we were kids, we used to say giant baba.

575
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
It's a bit of a joke, though.

576
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,820
It's a bit of a joke, but it's true.

577
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Giant baba, you know?

578
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,820
Everyone is holding their asses.

579
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
That's how it is.

580
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
Don't you have to sing together today?

581
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
One last word.

582
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,820
If you do that, again.

583
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,820
If you do that, again.

584
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,820
Let's drink and say goodbye.

585
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Do you understand?

586
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
If you don't say yes, I won't be able to hide it.

587
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I'll leave it to you.

588
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Do you understand?

589
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Do it like this.

590
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm serious.

591
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
Osaka is serious.

592
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,820
If you do that, again.

593
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Now, let's say goodbye.

594
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Let's go.

595
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
One, two.

596
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:19,820
It's over.

597
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,820
To be honest, I wasn't sure if it was a good idea.

598
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
It was a good idea.

599
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
It was a good idea.

600
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
I've only done it once or twice.

601
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,820
I'm addicted to it.

602
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,820
It was about six years ago.

603
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
I'm addicted to it.

604
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
I'm addicted to it.

605
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I don't know how the audience will react to this show.

606
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
I'm scared.

607
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
What will happen next week?

608
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,820
What are you going to do next week?

609
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
What?

610
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
What?

611
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,820
You're going to say that right before the show.

612
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,820
I have six regular shows in Osaka.

613
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,820
It's the most painful show.

614
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,820
Even though the staff is free.

615
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,820
The staff says, today's assistant is cute.

616
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
When people are holding their heads.

617
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,820
They say, he was cute before he left.

618
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,820
I didn't see it.

619
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
I didn't see it.

620
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
I didn't have the courage.

621
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
I'm happy.

622
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,820
But it's been a while.

623
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
It's been a while.

624
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,820
Let's do our best for now.

625
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Good-bye for now.

626
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,820
