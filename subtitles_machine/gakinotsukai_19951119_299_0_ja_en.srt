1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the fall of 1995, Gaki no Tsukai was broadcasted 299 times from the start.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Therefore, this week is the 300th anniversary of Gaki no Tsukai.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
1990, the start of the program.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Many opening programs have been deepened by inviting various famous entertainers.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The appearance of Kin-chan's virtual grand prize, the punishment game, and many other memories have been engraved.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In 1991, the program received a huge response and broadcasted day and night from late at night.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In 1992, the famous So-chan-ka Grand Prix was born this year and became a hot topic.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In 1993, the program reached a viewing rate of 20%.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In 1993, the program reached a viewing rate of 20% and had a fun time with many people.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And from 1994, let's start today's Kouyuu-roku.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The fourth episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Tsuki-tsuki, Guts-tataiten, how many points will it get?

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The entertainer who was invited as a talk show, how many points will it get?

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They were two people who were very nervous about the former world champion, Guts Ishimatsu-san.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing?

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We've met quite a long time ago.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you remember, Gaku-san?

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, I do.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why?

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What kind of arm is that?

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think it was about 10 years ago.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We had an interview once.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Arm wrestling.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Arm wrestling?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's good.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have a big arm.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Excuse me.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It was Guts Ishimatsu-san. Thank you very much.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you very much.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The eighth episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Tsuki-tsuki, entertainer, Omae So-chan or Grand Prix?

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In the popular show, Omae So-chan or Grand Prix, we have invited such a rare guest.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Come on out! Ota-san! Ota-san!

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come on out, Marina Watanabe-san!

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Have you ever been caught at a traffic inspection?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ah, it's a girl? So it's only for girls?

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Eh, that's right!

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What do you mean I'm Tama's running guy?

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I get it

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Next is this!

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're a minor!

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're only in elementary school!

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're only in elementary school!

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Next is this!

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You eat 8 meals a day!

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're only in elementary school!

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're only in elementary school!

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're only in elementary school!

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't say it like that!

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When I write it, it seems like I'm writing something bad

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's wrong? What's wrong?

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're Tama's running guy?

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Tama's running guy is really bad!

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Next is Mako-chan!

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Surprisingly, there are a lot of people like this

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's good about it?

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're a minor!

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ah, I don't know about that

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Marina!

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, I really, as an image...

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
As an image, I say, I'll go to your place

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't say that!

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now, Matsumoto-san

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know your name, but

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're the weirdo of the Comedian Club

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hikari Ijuin from Wato

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Matsumura Kunihiro

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yamata Kuniko

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Matsumura

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Matsumura

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Matsumura Kunihiro

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Matsumura Kunihiro

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Matsumura Kunihiro

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yamata Kuniko-san

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah, wait a minute!

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're pretty good at English

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry to bother you today

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No problem

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Today, Tama's running...

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I heard that you've been studying for a long time

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I've already studied

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I came here on purpose

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And we co-starred with Tama's running

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You've seen a lot of things

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's a rare creature

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's right

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oops, I took the book

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's moving fast from here

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
First of all, the internal organs

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The internal organs are all out

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you looking at?

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you looking at Gaten?

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Gaten?

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Huh?

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's Gaten

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What kind of magazine is Gaten?

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Gaten is a work magazine

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a work magazine

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's bad

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's trying to get rid of Tama

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Regarding this magazine

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't show the erotic part at all

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's scary

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll show you the erotic part

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Excuse me

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you for waiting

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's unnatural for a woman to be angry

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's amazing

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He's laughing

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's laughing

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's laughing

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And with the world's Ryuichi Sakamoto

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This kind of project

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm the world's Sakamoto

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Who are you?

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why are you here?

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm the world's Sakamoto

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Why are you here?

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What's wrong with you?

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm a man without a reason

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Even if it's hot in summer

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't lose to summer

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a great opponent

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
To prevent summer

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have to say something useful

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Say something useful?

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Matsumoto-kun, do you have something useful?

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Leave it to me

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Something useful?

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You have a serogun, don't you?

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I have a medical license

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Shut up

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You've been doing this for 1000 years

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think it's good to have a serogun

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have to move your body in summer

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even if I move my body, I can't lose to summer

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Matsumoto-kun, what kind of sports do you do in summer?

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've been thinking about this

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What have you been doing?

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I've been talking

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What have you been doing?

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Skiing

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Skiing?

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Skiing is good

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Skiing is good

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's dive together

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's dive

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
One, two

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Feels good

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What do you do when you talk?

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can't talk

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can't talk?

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't talk in the water

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ah, I see

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In that case

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You have to give a signal like this

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You have to go up and talk

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's annoying

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It can't be helped

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ah, I see

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's go again

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What happened?

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The video I took a long time ago looked good

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're annoying

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And he also got to know a lot of youkai living in the entertainment world

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
First of all, you can't see youkai

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Today, youkai

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's said that there are a lot of youkai that have disappeared

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The youkai that live in Japan now

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Youkai

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There are 5.6 million

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's a lot

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's a lot

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Are you everywhere?

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm walking around

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's not funny

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is that?

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What is that?

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What is that?

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What is that?

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look at that

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What is that?

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What is that in the middle?

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey, come on

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Come on

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What is that?

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is this youkai?

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is youkai

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't come too close

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What is that?

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Youkai cat girl

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is funny

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's funny

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's funny

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Try to hit it

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What is this?

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm scared

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What is this?

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What is this?

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
There's something

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What is this?

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What is that?

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's my bag

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's my bag

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What is this?

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What is this?

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What is this?

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What is this?

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Youkai cat girl

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Get the water from the other side

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Get the water from the other side

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is not good

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is not good

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Come here

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is not good

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is not good

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come here

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What is this?

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's not sliding

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What is this?

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is not good

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What is this?

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hey

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sing a song

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Please

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's youkai

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Youkai

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What youkai

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What's wrong?

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What's wrong?

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What?

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's youkai

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why are you so nervous?

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not nervous

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're nervous because you're shining

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're nervous because you're shining

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You bastard

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're nervous because you're shining

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If you hug me, it's over

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If you hug me, you won't say anything interesting

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Clear

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm a little fatter

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're noisy

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He's familiar with Chi-Chi

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He has a deep relationship with her in private

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Good evening

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Good evening

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Chi-Chi

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What is it?

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's Chi-Chi's otaku

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're so cheeky

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a great house

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's not

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a great house

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's a great house

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's a great house

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's a great house

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hello

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hello

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are you his wife?

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you doing?

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Thank you

274
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ma'am, this is a little boring

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank you

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What are you doing?

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Please sit down

280
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Excuse me

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'd like to have a special sushi

282
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Please sit down

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you really do that?

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You don't have to do anything

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What is it?

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Since you're here

288
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What is it?

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'd like to help you

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's right

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Plus

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We can only think about others

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've helped you a lot

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you doing?

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Today

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'd like you to lend me some money

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Today

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Since it's a new house

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd like to check the power

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why do you want to check the power?

302
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Downtown means checking the power

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Originally

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I see

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
When you use a vacuum cleaner

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You use a lot of electricity

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm tired

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're tired

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm tired

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll give you a massage

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why do you look so sad?

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Chiichi

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What is it?

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm doing nothing

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm checking the power

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm doing it for you

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll put on a dryer

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's put on a dryer

319
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The power is okay

320
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's go to the microwave

321
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Switch on

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is pretty

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I've been waiting for you

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Thank you

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Today

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'd like you to help me

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'd like you to see a lot of things

328
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
For his friends

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He will cook for them

330
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a warm-hearted project

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hey

332
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Stop

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Stop

334
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What kind of mind play is this?

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's boiling

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is good

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The fish is melting

338
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Wait a minute

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
How is it?

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's crispy

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It tastes like Koya

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This is good

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is good

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is expensive

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is expensive

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll put this

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Stop

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wait a minute

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What is this?

352
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's like an art

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's like an art

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's like a teacher's self-made dish

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Are you going to eat this?

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please eat it

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm doing something useless

358
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
After the commercial

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Wada Akiko and Ume Miya Tatsuo have a good time

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And the host of the entertainment world

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Wada Akiko and Ume Miya Tatsuo

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
To clear up the suspicion

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This kind of project

364
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Wada Akiko and Ume Miya Tatsuo

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The defendant, please come in

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Wada Akiko and Ume Miya Tatsuo

367
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Wada Akiko has started the trial of a man

368
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
After the trial

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'd like to ask Professor Matsumoto to come in

370
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And I'd like to verify a lot of things

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Professor, please come in

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Nice to meet you

373
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Nice to meet you

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'd like to take a picture of evidence

375
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Wada, look at this

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm going to take off your monster face today

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's take a look

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is the picture of the pilot Wada

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If you look at it like this

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not much different from the picture we usually see

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's right

382
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And using a computer

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I tried to get closer

384
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You were closer

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes, I was

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then I found out a terrible truth

387
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You bastard

388
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I knew it

389
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I got a great video

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Is that so?

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you look at this

392
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's going to be a big decision

393
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Understood

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I think it was last year when I was crying

395
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I was a little drunk

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
My wife took me to the hospital

397
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I was also diagnosed three or four times

398
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But the real Wada was more manly than I saw on TV

399
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can go home at least three times

400
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's already decided

401
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's decided

402
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Excuse me

403
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is that a woman?

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's a woman

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a woman again, you bastard

406
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
First of all, I would like you to see the proof photo

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Please take it out

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Please take it out

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is funny

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Is this before the show?

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm wearing this

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You're still wearing it

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Next

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We have a video

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Umeda station

418
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This is the doll in front of us

419
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This is the 10th floor

420
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Is that a doll?

421
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Next

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is a doll

423
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This is a doll

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This is a doll that looks exactly like Tatsu Umemiya

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's right

426
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That means

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is a replica

428
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We saw that this is a doll

429
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Please bring the proof photo

430
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Is that so?

431
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This is it

432
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Everyone, if you pass by a Harajuku store, please take a picture

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Like this

434
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
D Haisho

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Masabuchi

436
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Also today

437
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:27,000
From Robin Hood

438
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The famous Thai actor

439
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is a story

440
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So today we're going to test it out.

441
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Professor, Sumi is here!

442
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Sit down, Sumi!

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Professor, is this the machine?

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This is the machine. Let's take a look.

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Baseball is a pitcher, but at night it's a batter.

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's out!

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's already out?

448
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Professor, what's going on here?

449
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's this?

450
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This is my meal today.

451
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Who's your meal?

452
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You're making me sick!

453
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sit down!

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The results are out!

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The results are out?

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay!

457
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The results are out!

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But the meter is moving!

459
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What is that thing in the east?

460
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's huge!

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's nice!

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's creepy!

463
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Isn't this Nausicaa in the wind valley?

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's coming out!

465
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What kind of show is this?

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What's going on here?

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's white!

468
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What are you guys doing?

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The first episode of the Gaki no Tsukai Arahenji, Chikitsuki!

470
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Sokessan in 1994, the natural botanist grand prize!

471
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
In 1994, there were people like this who can't be missed in variety shows.

472
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is the judge, Mr. Matsumoto.

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm the judge.

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's right.

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What is it today?

476
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Well, I don't know.

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry, I don't really know.

478
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm the judge.

479
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
For the time being, it's a very easy-to-understand project that we're going to decide on the best natural botanist of the year.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I see.

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's introduce the three nominees.

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yamasaki Hosei.

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And next to him is Kouda Shin.

484
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Nice to meet you.

485
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And last but not least, Tetsu-chan from Dega.

486
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Nice to meet you, Dega.

487
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Sokkyo Utagassen!

488
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Japan Passing.

489
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Come on!

490
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Dega-san!

491
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You're fast, Dega!

492
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Go ahead!

493
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Ah, Japan Passing!

494
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You're Japan Passing!

495
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
How are you going to live in this cramped city?

496
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What do you want to do?

497
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Are you okay?

498
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
When I was in 3rd grade, you were in 1st grade.

499
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That was in 11th grade.
