1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good morning

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Kiyomoto

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Who?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ats конц, she has another boyfriend

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,100
boyfriend

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
What?

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,100
Hayate

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Do not know

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Still gone

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
I wonder

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,100
Oh, wait

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Hey, Hamada.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,100
Can you stop smoking?

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Why?

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
I don't like the smell of the collar.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Turn it off.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
He's smoking.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,100
He's cool when he's smoking.

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,160
Hello

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,120
Eyes though

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,860
I'll take it seriously

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,520
Is that a woman?

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,520
There's nothing wrong with that.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
I know.

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Yamagaki has been here a few times.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Oh, really?

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Eri, do you want some food?

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm fine.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
No, you're not.

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Which one?

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Tanaka!

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Choose one.

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
You can bring it over here.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Oh, okay.

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Which one do you want?

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Which one is better?

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Which one is better?

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Then, let's decide which one is the best.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay.

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Ready, set...

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Huh?

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
It's the same!

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
It's the same!

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
The numbers are different.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
The numbers are...

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Huh?

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I think it's a little bit related to the lunch box.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
It's not related.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Here.

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
This?

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Oh, there's beef and chicken.

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Okay.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Looks delicious.

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Please give us a briefing for tonight.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Hello.

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Hello.

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Today, we're going to do owner-atelier.

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
How many times can we do this?

61
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
One time?

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
One time.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,520
For now, we'll do it a few times.

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
What is this?

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
So you mean 5 people?

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Yes, 5 people.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,520
I think I've done this 50 times.

68
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,520
You went to the Fukuoka festival with me the other day, right?

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
I took a picture of you.

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Really?

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Yes. Do you want to see it?

72
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Yes, I want to see it.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Let's see it together.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
It's like a miracle.

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
It hurts.

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Amazing.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
It's like a miracle.

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
It's good that you're here.

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Well, someone else, put in a different one!

80
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Like Tajima, that kind of guy.

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,520
He looks like he can't do it.

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,520
It's a question of how to succeed.

83
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
That's good.

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I was a little scared.

85
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
It's like something's coming up.

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
How many people are there if you put in two?

87
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
There are about 40 or 50 people.

88
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Oh, look at this.

89
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I've seen Puget.

90
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Puget.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,520
What are you doing?

92
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm standing.

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm watching the show.

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Yesterday I went to the museum and found something really nice.

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
What is it?

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Can you see it?

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
This.

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
I'll show you.

99
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
What is it?

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I wonder what it is.

101
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
What is it?

102
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
A present.

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Really?

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Yes.

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Thank you.

106
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Everyone worked hard.

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
How is it?

108
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Wow, wow, wow.

109
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
This is the room.

110
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Wow, it suits you.

111
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Really?

112
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
It looks really cute.

113
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
It suits you.

114
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,520
I think this is good for the students.

115
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,520
This is perfect for today because it's cold.

116
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
It's for 5 people.

117
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
It's really good.

118
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
This is good.

119
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
It's like a girae-sa.

120
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm glad.

121
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

122
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Thank you.

123
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
It's nice.

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Then, shall we go to the Super Town?

125
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Yes.

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Let's change.

127
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Thank you.

128
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
Thank you.

129
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
I...

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,520
I think I'll go with this.

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
Why?

132
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Why?

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Why?

134
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I'll go to the toilet.

135
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You'll go to the toilet?

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Yes.

137
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
It's easier to do it in a jersey.

138
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
I'm wearing this because I'm wearing a jersey.

139
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
But it's a little weird.

140
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
It suits you.

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
It suits you.

142
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
It's a natto so it's easier to wear a jersey.

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
What do you think?

144
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
I think this is good.

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
I think this suits me.

146
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I don't know if you can change it right away but...

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
For now, this is good.

148
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
In short, you can hold this.

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Yes, yes.

150
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Later, yes.

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Then, will you see my pocket?

152
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
I'll be right there.

153
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Yamaguchi-chan, this is for you.

154
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Where are you going?

155
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
I'm going to the toilet.

156
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Oh, really?

157
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
What should I do with Eri?

158
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Eri's car...

159
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
It's a car, right?

160
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
What do you mean?

161
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I want to go with her.

162
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Eri's car is coming, right?

163
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
So...

164
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Yamaguchi, can you drive?

165
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
No, no, no.

166
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Can you come with me?

167
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm going to take the bus with Eri.

168
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Can you come with me?

169
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm going to drive.

170
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
No, no, no.

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I don't want to go home.

172
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Don't come.

173
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Don't be so funny.

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I drive Audi.

175
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,520
I quit smoking.

176
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
You quit?

177
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes.

178
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Thank you.

179
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
And I'm a gambler.

180
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Yes, you're a gambler.

181
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Let's go.

182
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Yes.

183
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Please.

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Please take care of me.

185
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Please.

186
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Please take care of me.

187
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
What do you do in the movie?

188
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Oh, my cell phone is missing!

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Really?

190
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
No, what should I do?

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
It's somewhere in the back, right?

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
It's not here.

193
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,520
No, I can't go there.

194
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Please, look for it.

195
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
It's silver.

196
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
No, what should I do?

197
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Endo, look for it.

198
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
I can't go there.

199
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Look around.

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
I can't go there.

201
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Tachibana!

202
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Put your phone down!

203
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
It's my silver phone!

204
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm telling you it's your phone! Why don't you put it down?

205
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Where's the last one?

206
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Where's the last one?

207
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Ah!

208
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
There it is!

209
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Sorry!

210
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Ah, there it is. That's good.

211
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
There it is.

212
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Sorry.

213
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
That's good.

214
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
That's good.

215
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Let's go, let's go.

216
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,520
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

217
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
You scared me.

218
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,520
I haven't done so.

219
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Errp.

220
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Dam Phu Yen.

221
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,220
Youanız, I haven't done it before.

222
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Then why would only you and I find it interesting?

223
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Haha...

224
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I really enjoyed it.

225
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,940
So the song has to be heard by last, Matsumoto, at the end...

226
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,440
Yes, yes.

227
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
And, for now, let's go to the 50th floor.

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,940
The 50th floor.

229
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
It's that far?

230
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,940
It looks like a car.

231
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,440
What?

232
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
It's cold.

233
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
It's 4 degrees, and we're having a meeting.

234
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,940
Hurry up, it's cold.

235
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm so stressed out from driving.

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,940
So why did you come with us?

237
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,940
They're old people.

238
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,940
They're old people.

239
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,940
They're old people.

240
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Will you come, Azuma-san?

241
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
Please.

242
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Azuma-san, it's the 5th floor.

243
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,340
We'll do a meeting, so you'll be the fifth.

244
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,240
Fifth.

245
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,140
The fifth in the order of the meeting.

246
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,340
If you succeed, you'll get 100,000 yen.

247
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,540
Eri and Ton, you know.

248
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,440
Of course, I'll get red.

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
If it's just the five of us.

250
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,940
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,440
You're looking at me.

252
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Excuse me, the stand-in.

253
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,840
Mr. Amasawa, please come to the stand-in.

254
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Where am I?

255
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,340
You're lying.

256
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
It's not like that.

257
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,840
It's starting.

258
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm sorry for wearing it.

259
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm sorry. I'll bring it.

260
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I'll take a picture.

261
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Don't touch it!

262
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,840
The first owner's jump competition!

263
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Yay!

264
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Thank you!

265
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Are you ready?

266
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,840
This time, the five of you will go in order.

267
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,840
If you can get 50 times, the prize money will be 100,000 yen.

268
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
It's difficult.

269
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
It's about the same as a school request.

270
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
It's difficult.

271
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
50 times.

272
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,840
If you succeed, it's 100,000 yen, so each person gets 20,000 yen.

273
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
That's right.

274
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I'll do my best!

275
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Thank you!

276
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Alright!

277
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Thank you.

278
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Are you okay?

279
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Are you okay with the opening?

280
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm not okay.

281
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Let's start from here.

282
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
1, 2, 3, 4.

283
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Mr. Asaba, this way.

284
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
This way.

285
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
To the left.

286
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Let's go.

287
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Let's go.

288
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Let's start!

289
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Stop it!

290
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Yabachan!

291
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Sorry.

292
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
It's okay.

293
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
It's okay.

294
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
It's okay.

295
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
It's okay.

296
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
It's okay.

297
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Let's do it properly.

298
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
What are you doing?

299
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Let's do it properly.

300
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Matsumoto!

301
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Let's do it!

302
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm doing it!

303
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's continue!

304
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Please!

305
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Let's continue!

306
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
One more time!

307
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Let's do it again!

308
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
It's delicious!

309
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
It's delicious!

310
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
It's good.

311
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
You're not doing it.

312
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
The camera is rolling.

313
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm doing it!

314
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Let's go.

315
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm sorry.

316
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm sorry.

317
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
I'm sorry.

318
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
You're too slow.

319
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm sorry.

320
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
It's hard.

322
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Wait a minute.

323
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Wait a minute.

324
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
I want to go to the toilet.

325
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Why can't you go in?

326
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I'm sorry.

327
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
What is it?

328
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I want to go to the toilet.

329
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
You can go.

330
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
There is a toilet.

331
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Mr.Soda, please guide him.

332
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
She is a girl.

333
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
I can't let you do that.

335
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Isn't it beautiful?

336
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll take you to the toilet.

337
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
I'll go with you.

338
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm recording.

339
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
No, you can't.

340
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Let's do it.

341
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
I can't let you go alone.

342
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
I'll take you to the hospital.

343
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,840
If you don't feel well, you can go with me.

344
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
You'll catch a cold.

345
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes, I'll catch a cold.

346
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
You're crying.

347
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I'm sorry.

348
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
You'll be fine after a while.

349
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I'll take you to the hospital.

350
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
What is this?

351
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
What should we do?

352
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Where did you go? Did you go to a hotel?

353
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Around the hotel?

354
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
You can go to the public toilet there.

355
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I was told that I should think about it.

356
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
You were told that you should think about it?

357
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,840
You are a girl.

358
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
It's still quite a long way to go.

359
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
I think it's about time.

360
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
The sun is already setting. It's cold.

361
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
We're back.

362
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
It's about time.

363
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,840
What should we do? Should we try the same pattern again?

364
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Let's take a picture of the five of us together.

365
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
They're not coming back.

366
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
What are you doing?

367
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
What's going on?

368
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
They're fighting.

369
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Why are you fighting? Come back from the front.

370
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,120
the other day

371
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,620
That woman is brazen

372
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,460
oh you the woman

373
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,200
you tried to pick up at the opposite way

374
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
you can not do it

375
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,760
фильader

376
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,240
I do not like to

377
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,700
Oh, you've gone back

378
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,960
Yeah, on the contrary

379
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm going home

380
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,780
Y hurricane

381
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,080
Tama, please bring him

382
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,060
Yes

383
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,060
Hurry up!

384
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Let's go!

385
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,060
Let's start the show!

386
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
What?

387
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
Eri is angry

388
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Let's do it

389
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
Yes

390
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
It's dangerous

391
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Let's start the show

392
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Eri!

393
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Let's go!

394
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
Hurry up!

395
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
Let's go!

396
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,060
4, 3, 2...

397
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
Eri!

398
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Let's go!

399
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,060
Hey, Masumoto!

400
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Masumoto!

401
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Hurry up!

402
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
Hurry up!

403
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Hey!

404
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
Hey, Eri!

405
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,060
Wait a minute!

406
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
Masumoto!

407
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Eri?

408
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
Where are you?

409
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,060
Sorry about that.

410
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Hey, Masamune-san?

411
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Hello?

412
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
Hey!

413
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,060
Hello?

414
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Eri?

415
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
Hello? Hello?

416
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Eri?

417
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
The signal is bad!

418
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Hey! Eri?

419
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Hello?

420
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Hey!

421
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Let's go home.

422
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,060
And I hear your voice

423
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
What's this?

424
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
This year was the Asian Par-piyon

425
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Hamada is also an Asian Par-piyon

426
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Hamada is also an...

427
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
AHHHHHHHHH

428
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
You speak to me only.

429
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
This year was the Asian Par-piyon

430
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Hamada is also an Asian Par-piyon

431
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,060
But as expected, Mama...

432
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Tama-san, let's wrap it up.

433
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Well, since you guys didn't watch the opening, you probably don't understand it well.

434
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
I don't like that kind of thing!

435
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
You don't like it?

436
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
I don't like it!

437
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
But you're embarrassed?

438
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
Embarrassed?

439
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Well, that kind of thing is popular right now, right?

440
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
What is?

441
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,060
The one who is dating with a talent

442
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,060
They are doing it in many different songs

443
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,060
If I was given that kind of thing, I would not go back

444
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,060
I don't like being sucked into it

445
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
I don't like it

446
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Why? You don't know what it is, right?

447
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,060
I can't think of it

448
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,060
And you don't know who will come

449
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,060
I'm sure that I will do it with my grandmother today.

450
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
I want to have a good time with her.

451
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,060
Well, you have to do your best from the middle.

452
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
You will do it.

453
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I will do it with my grandmother all the time.

454
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
Well, this is...

455
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
It's difficult.

456
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,060
Why can you do it?

457
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
I don't know.

458
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
I think you can do it.

459
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,060
I was wearing a cctv in the car and talking to myself.

460
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
I was like, I'm going to have an accident.

461
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm going to have an accident because I'm scared.

462
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
I'm sorry.

463
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
I can't do this anymore.

464
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
I'll end this.

465
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I'll end this. I'm embarrassed.

466
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
I can't think of anything.

467
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
But this is a show.

468
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
No, no, no, no, no.

469
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,060
I'm not doing this for real.

470
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,060
If the camera follows me like this, I can still do it.

471
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
I can work somewhere.

472
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:08,560
I mean, we're so far away from each other, so if you're walking with your hands in Shibuya, it's not going to work.

473
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I can't even think!

474
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,560
But if you're a regular person, it's impossible.

475
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm really, really, I'm sweating.

476
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,560
If you say that, you might get an offer.

477
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
No, no, no.

478
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm not going anywhere.

479
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm telling you, I'm not going anywhere even if I get 100 million yen.

480
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Never!

481
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Why?

482
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
You don't want to see me like that, right?

483
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
No.

484
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
You're not doing that behind my back, are you?

485
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
No, no, no.

486
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
What do you mean by a date-maker?

487
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
It's been a while.

488
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,560
I've been doing this for about two weeks now.

489
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Well, well.

490
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
It's fine.

491
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Well, well, I guess I'll stop talking about the show.

492
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
It's great.

493
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,560
But, you know, I can't really support it.

494
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I watched a really interesting DVD the other day.

495
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Well, it's an AV.

496
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,560
It's an AV, but it's a documentary.

497
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
I'll invite two AV actresses.

498
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,560
He was a famous AV actress who was pooping in front of people.

499
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
That sounds interesting.

500
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
It's really funny.

501
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
I don't like it!

502
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
I can't think of anything!

503
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Why?

504
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,560
That's not something you do in front of people.

505
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
That child is a good child.

506
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
I see.

507
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Actually, Sonoko was bullied when she was a child.

508
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I see.

509
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
And then she got a little bit traumatized.

510
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,560
She couldn't talk to people because she was so depressed.

511
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,560
To overcome that, she pooped in front of people.

512
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Why?

513
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Why?

514
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Why? You think, right?

515
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
But that woman said,

516
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I know that, but...

517
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Hey!

518
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I got it!

519
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I got it, you!

520
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
And then,

521
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
I said,

522
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I'll do it!

523
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
And when I said I'll do it,

524
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I said,

525
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
What year were you born?

526
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
And I looked back at old photos.

527
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,560
I looked back at the old photos!

528
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
I looked back at them, you!

529
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
In terms of profile?

530
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Like profile photos.

531
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
I see.

532
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
That kind of stuff comes out.

533
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
You're making it up.

534
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Two girls come out, but they end up doing it.

535
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
They're doing their makeup beautifully.

536
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
The makeup artist does it.

537
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Now they're doing their makeup to poop.

538
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
But, you know,

539
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
But, you know,

540
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,560
There's no such thing as a straw.

541
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,560
I said, and he was like, I've decided!

542
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
He was really excited.

543
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I see.

544
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,560
There was a red carpet with carpet lights.

545
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Two people came out.

546
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
That's right.

547
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
There were about 30 people.

548
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
They were clapping.

549
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
And there was a stage in the middle.

550
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
The stage was really crowded.

551
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
It was like this.

552
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
It was amazing, right?

553
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
It looked interesting.

554
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
The first girl who was doing it in love said,

555
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Well then, I'll do it.

556
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,560
But I was so nervous that I couldn't do it.

557
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I thought, I couldn't do it.

558
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
The next girl who had to do it,

559
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
was watching it from the front.

560
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I see.

561
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
I couldn't do it.

562
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I don't know what she thought.

563
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
The next girl who did it said,

564
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Do your best!

565
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
If you do that, the other guests will also say,

566
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Do your best!

567
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Go with all your might!

568
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Go with all your might!

569
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
There are other ways!

570
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
And then, on the way, they'll start crying.

571
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Saying, I can't do it!

572
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
I'm already this cool.

573
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
I can't do it.

574
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Then, the director will say,

575
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,560
If you don't come out, it's like starting a new year tomorrow.

576
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
What?

577
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560
And then, the second one.

578
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
The second one was just saying that he'll do his best.

579
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
He was full of motivation.

580
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
And then, all of a sudden...

581
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Hmm...

582
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Pooh!
