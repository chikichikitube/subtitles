Chikitsuki Flash Oogiri Daisakusei

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been a long time since I came out of the opening.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is in front of the Fuji TV entrance.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
From here, a car will appear.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm going to have you do what you like.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's introduce the main characters of the day.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The car and the story teller.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's go!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Nankan no Gaki no Tsukai Arahen de

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello!

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nankan no Gaki no Tsukai Arahen de

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm the main character of the day.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm drunk.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nankan no Gaki no Tsukai Arahen de

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ready!

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The tools are here.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can use it as much as you like.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes!

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mr. Haritoko!

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can ride a tire!

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you doing?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes!

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Haritoko!

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mr. Haritoko!

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes!

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Haritoko, here you go!

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Next!

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mr. Noriyoshi!

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm scared!

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mr. Noriyoshi!

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mr. Noriyoshi, are you okay?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm okay!

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mr. Noriyoshi, please!

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Kissa-matto-pon-netto!

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Noriyoshi!

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're in danger!

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Next!

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Screw!

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Screw!

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, please!

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Screw-wide-shon-parappa!

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's this?

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Um...

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Asumoto!

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I wrote this!

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, you wrote it!

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No, you wrote it!

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, you wrote it!

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I wrote it in the book!

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, you wrote it in the book!

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I wrote it in the book!

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I wrote it in the book!

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mr. Yamazaki, would you like to say something before this course is over?

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm worried.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where's the spare tire if you don't have a tire?

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What?

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where's the spare tire?

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, hey!

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Here it is!

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you have a tire?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes!

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mr. Yamazaki, please come this far.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have a tire!

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mr. Yamazaki, please come this far.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes!

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Noriyoshi!

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't break it even though it's meaningless!

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is funny!

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What's this?

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's a bumper, isn't it?

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I wish I could get it, but I can't get anything.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Bum-bum!

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Run away!

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum!

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing?

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't think of this.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The original position is...

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't say the original position!

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's a song at the door.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a song, right?

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, please!

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go over the hill.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
While blowing the whistle, the mountain passes through the blue sky.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's sing a song with the leaves pointing at us.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The door! The door!

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a long song!

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a long song!

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's getting hot!

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you doing?

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I picked up 452 yen.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The shadow that sinks beyond the darkness.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's too high.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The white wings...

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Gashama!

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm scared! I'm nervous!

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you very much!

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We did our best!

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, please get on this and go home.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you very much!

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go!

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes!

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Get on!

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Take care!

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll call you at night!

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll call you at night!

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Tomorrow?

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes, tomorrow!

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you!

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Take care!

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you!

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
See you!

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you!

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you!

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Smile!

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you!

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thank you!

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you!

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll call you at night!

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you!

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you!

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you!

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you!

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you!

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you!

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you!

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you!

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you!

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you!

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you!

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you!

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good evening!

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not interesting at all.

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's right.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well...

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yesterday was a little fun.

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's right.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, no.

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yesterday...

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well...

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go hook up with a girl.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No matter how many times it takes, I'll do it.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not like I'm going to do it.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I thought it was too much in the last century, but I'm still doing it.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, then...

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My car...

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a medium-sized car.

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well...

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll make it the headquarters.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll make it the headquarters.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And now...

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well...

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well...

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Team Zero's Yamazaki.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll send you a lot of things.

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I see, I see.

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And...

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's buy a transceiver.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, for that.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll send you the information as soon as possible.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
As soon as possible.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll send it to the headquarters.

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll send it to the headquarters.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I'm going to wait here with a transceiver.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You too...

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And when he finds a good woman with a transceiver,

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll go and ask her for her phone number.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In some cases, there are times when she doesn't tell me anything.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll go to the headquarters and ask for her support.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That means you're going out, right?

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Boom, boom.

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll ask for your support.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I'll catch it and get out of the car.

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Here you go, Matsumoto.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, no.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's too much.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on.

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What to do.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, that's...

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's too much.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's really noisy.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, I did that.

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's too much.

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's too stupid.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not stupid.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The last transceiver.

194
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The transceiver is expensive.

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you want to buy it?

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right.

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is it expensive?

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you buy it properly, it's not a pair right now.

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They only sell one.

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I see.

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right?

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's why one is so expensive.

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That one is...

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's almost 30,000 yen.

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Your salary is too high.

206
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you talking about?

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If I could, I'd like to split it into three.

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you want that much?

209
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'd like to split it into three.

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'd like to split it into three.

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a half and a half.

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a half and a half.

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know.

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I need 100,000 yen.

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm so sorry.

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry I'm doing what I'm doing.

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My crew is the headquarters.

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What are you talking about?

219
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, it's not.

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you get 100,000 yen for that, you'll be scolded by your mother.

221
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's stop that.

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm already giving up.

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Our staff.

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's the staff.

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was about to go home, but at that time I saw something on the window.

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Instant camera.

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Polaroid camera.

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Polaroid camera.

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I bought it.

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is this?

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Are you going to take a picture of the captain?

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm waiting at the headquarters.

233
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They take the polaroid camera and go to various places.

234
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's very common.

235
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Even if you ask for a lot of phone numbers, you don't know who is who.

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the face and this is the phone number.

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's right.

238
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I asked for the phone number and took a picture.

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I collected some of them and separated them later.

240
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is Maachan.

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is Maachan.

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is what you want to do.

243
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're having fun.

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I didn't have much fun.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There are many things.

246
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm doing it.

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was a little sad when I was doing it.

248
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm 29 years old.

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wanted three transceivers.

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I want to play too.

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's change the story.

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The only sport I like is boxing.

254
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know. I lost.

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Who? Yuji Watanabe?

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I lost.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If this happens, Japanese boxing is a little painful.

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If this happens, there will be Tyson.

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Japan will issue bail.

260
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll get it out.

261
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll get Tyson out of jail and make him a Japanese nationality.

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What?

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Taizo Sakakibara.

264
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Where is Sakakibara from?

265
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There are many Japanese names.

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why did you choose Sakakibara?

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's more Japanese.

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Sakakibara and Tyson.

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think the Japanese boxing world will improve considerably.

270
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But this guy will come with me.

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don King.

272
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don King?

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He looks like a guy at Tokyo Station.

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
His hair is like this.

275
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
His hair is like this.

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is that so?

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

278
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Does he look like me?

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He looks like you a lot.

280
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But he doesn't appear on TV.

281
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why does he have such a head?

282
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If he didn't have such a head, he wouldn't be able to do it.

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It will harden and harden.

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And eventually.

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It will be like this.

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You should wash your head.

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What are you doing?

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't know what you're doing.

289
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I was dancing, so I didn't know what you were doing.

290
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I see.

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is what happens when you wash your hair.

293
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know if I should do boxing.

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What is this?

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's scary.

296
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Idiot.

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you do this, you won't get hit.

298
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But if you do this, you'll get hit.

299
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's scary.

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why are you like this?

301
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're the one who gets hit.

302
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There was a time when I didn't know what to do.

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was invited by you, so I joined this world.

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I really wanted to do it in the world of boxing.

305
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Really?

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Really.

307
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you want to be?

308
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to be a police officer.

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You've been watching that kind of drama, haven't you?

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There's a narration at the end of the drama.

311
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's an announcement at the end.

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's right.

313
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's about the next sun.

314
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Gori runs.

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why did Gori run?

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Next time, Gori.

317
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's it.

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Please tell me.

319
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's it.

320
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No matter how many times I say it, everyone says it's a lie.

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There was one.

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's the ear that was suddenly sent to the Nanamagari book.

323
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're really doing it.

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm not saying it's bad.

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're really doing it.

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I know it's an ear, but I'm not saying it's bad.

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're really doing it.

328
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The ear of Holmarin was sent to the Nanamagari book.

329
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No matter who you explain it to, everyone says it's a lie.

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Really?

331
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

332
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't remember either.

333
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It was suddenly sent to the Nanamagari book.

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's not the voice.

335
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a bad ear.

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Whose ear is this?

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Is it a nuisance?

338
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm not saying that.

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're saying a lot of things.

340
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Listen to the title.

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is it?

342
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was suddenly sent to the Nanamagari book.

343
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't like it.

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Tell me the title.

345
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a bad ear.

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I heard it.

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is it a nuisance?

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm not saying it's bad.

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Next time.

350
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a story I heard from my fencing friends.

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fencing.

352
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fencing.

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
About 10 years ago, there was a genius fencer called Inazuma from Amagasaki.

354
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That man won the world fencing championship at the age of 19.

355
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
After that, no one saw him.

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Rumor has it that he was very similar to Mr. Matsumoto.

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mr. Matsumoto, you are the Inazuma of Amagasaki.

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm a fencer.

359
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're a fencer.

360
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why are you a fencer?

361
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you the Inazuma of Amagasaki?

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, no.

363
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
At the time I read this, as you all know.

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's the first time I've heard of it.

365
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No, no.

366
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I've been doing it a lot.

367
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you're going to do it,

368
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What is it?

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What kind of shape is it?

370
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What do you mean by shape?

371
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's something like this.

372
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Something like a stance.

373
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It doesn't matter how you do it.

374
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I've been doing it for a long time.

375
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can do it.

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've been doing it for a long time.

377
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Tell me, what do you do?

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What do you do?

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How do you do it at first?

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's like this at first.

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, it's like this.

382
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And then?

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And then from here.

384
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's what I'm talking about.

385
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's what I'm talking about.

386
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you do?

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, basically, it's like this.

388
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What do you do with this hand?

389
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is Kojiko-sama's hand.

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're wearing it.

391
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're wearing a net.

392
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is this?

393
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's annoying when it's dripping.

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's like this, isn't it?

395
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No, no, no.

396
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's not at all.

397
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's not at all.

398
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm doing what I said.

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do it.

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You couldn't say anything.

401
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Can't you do that?

402
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No, no, no.

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's like this.

404
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's really a fencing.

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

406
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Because I can catch your hand.

407
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can see your hand.

408
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I can see it.

409
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Take it!

410
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Can I take it?

411
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Can I take it?

412
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You can't take it, can you?

413
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, come on.

414
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What is this?

415
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What is this?

416
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're a little fast.

417
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Really?

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Anyone can do this.

419
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Are you that fast?

420
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, I can't take it.

421
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, well, well.

422
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Give it a try.

423
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, well, well.

424
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can't talk to you.

425
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, Inazuma...

426
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There's no one left alive after Inazuma Zuki.

427
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What?

428
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What's that?

429
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Inazuma Zuki.

430
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is it Inazuma Zuki?

431
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, this is really dangerous.

432
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't imitate it too much.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't imitate it.

434
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
People who watch TV can't do this.

435
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Follow me.

436
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Go!

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't do this.

438
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's the season for red peppers to die.

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How are the downtown staff doing?

440
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
By the way, Kin-chan.

441
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Kin-chan is the general.

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Takeshi-san is the lord.

443
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Sanma-san is called a young man.

444
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What do you think the two of you want to be called by the young people?

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What do you want to be called?

446
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There's not much left.

447
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What's left?

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Eikichi Yaza is called the boss.

449
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, the commercial one?

450
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes, the boss.

451
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What else is there to express?

452
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The emperor.

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's a little tough.

454
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is it tough?

455
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's tough.

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Man!

457
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Man?

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Man?

459
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What man?

460
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's not a man.

461
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What are they called?

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hamada-man.

463
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If you say it, it would be bad.

464
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Looks like you're being made fun of.

465
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm a woman with a mask.

466
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Masumoto mask.

467
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Masumoto mask!

468
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is absurd.

469
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No!

470
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No.

471
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm not going to do that kind of stuff anymore.

472
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm not going to do that kind of stuff anymore.

473
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm going to talk about it in a more cool way.

474
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Like, a story or something like that.

475
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
A story or something like that.

476
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A legend or something like that would be good.

477
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A legend about Matsumoto.

478
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
A legend! Good morning!

479
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Matsumoto Matsudanaka or something like that.

480
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Hello, I'm Matsumoto Matsudanaka.

481
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Oh, yes, Matsumoto Matsudanaka!

482
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm Matsumoto Matsudanaka!

483
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
My name has changed!

484
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Good morning!

485
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Call me!

486
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
It's called Blue Jean.

487
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I don't know anything about that.

488
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I don't know anything about that.

489
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Matsumoto Blue Jean.

490
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,700
I'm not going to do that kind of stuff anymore.

491
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
I like that kind of stuff.

492
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Pansheron? Sakuron? Paburon?

493
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
There are a lot of things that end in the name of Kusumi.

494
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Is this some kind of code? Please tell me.

495
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Is that so? Pansheron? Sakuron?

496
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
That's your field.

497
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Is this a code?

498
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Kaigen.

499
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
What else is there?

500
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Noshin.

501
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Noshin?

502
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Pansheron?

503
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,700
What's this?

504
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Kerolin.

505
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Oh, Kerolin.

506
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
It just came out. Bafferin.

507
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Bafferin.

508
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
That's right.

509
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
That's right.

510
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Is this a code?

511
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Kusumi is basically a German word.

512
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Is that all you've got?

513
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
It's a German word.

514
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,700
If you say Seirogan, it's a German word.

515
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Well, you know...

516
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
The word for full moon is a circle.

517
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,700
German people pass each other, right?

518
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Well, um...

519
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Where are you going?

520
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
No, well, that's it.

521
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,700
It's called Seirogan.

522
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
That's bad.

523
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
That's bad.

524
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,700
What's a German word?

525
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
What's a German word?

526
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
What's wrong with you?

527
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
No, no, I'm wrong.

528
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
It's a German word.

529
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
That's not a German word. It's Seirogan.

530
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
That's right.

531
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
I mean, it sounds like it.

532
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
The one with luck.

533
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Pansheron.

534
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Right?

535
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Kabejin.

536
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
It sounds like it.

537
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,700
It's called Guru.

538
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
It's a German word.

539
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
You're making me angry.

540
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
What's wrong with you?

541
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm asking you.

542
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I don't know anything about medicine.

543
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Even two or three children.

544
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
When I say Pansheron,

545
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
That's what I think.

546
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
That's what I'm afraid of.

547
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
If you say Pansheron all of a sudden, that's a German word.

548
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
It's a problem with your personality.

549
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Pansheron, Kabejin.

550
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
If you say that, the children will be excited.

551
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
If you say it out loud, it's a German word.

552
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
If you say it out loud, it's a German word.

553
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
I don't know.

554
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,700
What are you guys doing?

555
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
I hate this postcard.

556
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Hello, everyone.
