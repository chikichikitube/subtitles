1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's get started.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, hello.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is it?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's Chi-Chi.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is it?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Chi-Chi's otaku painting.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're so cocky.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a great painting.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not great.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's Jomo Goten.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Jomo Goten?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't know.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Excuse me, may I?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sure.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Excuse me.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're wearing slippers.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're wearing sandals.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Chi-Chi's house has been renovated.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's been about six months.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Six months.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, he's sitting somewhere.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please come out, camera man.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I can't get through.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
A weird guy is here.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you his wife?

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you for coming.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please say hello.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Please say hello.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ma'am, this is a little boring.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you very much.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you doing?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's cold.

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Excuse me.

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please come in.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Excuse me.

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'd like to have a special sushi.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I can't believe you're a wife.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you very much.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't need to serve you anything.

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you want some coffee?

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you want some coffee?

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, that's fine.

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What?

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is a mansion.

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is not a mansion.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, this is...

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is outside.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Outside?

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're amazing.

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where can I get out of here?

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is this okay?

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please open the door.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's great.

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's great.

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are you doing?

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You look like a child.

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Open the door.

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you an elementary school student?

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're using a luxurious land, aren't you?

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why?

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's great.

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can have a room here.

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can have a room here.

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's true.

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is a small table.

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A small table.

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is a staircase.

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of course, the second floor.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The second floor?

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is a staircase.

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is this a fireplace?

83
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not a fireplace.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a bus stop.

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There's a space like this in the back.

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What is this?

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know.

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know.

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There's something written here.

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's a girl here, isn't there?

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There is.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There's a girl here.

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can see her panties.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can see her panties.

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you going to do with her panties?

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ma-chan will come today.

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let her go somewhere else.

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's dangerous.

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why?

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's the right thing to do.

101
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I can't do that.

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why don't you go to an art museum?

103
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to a forest.

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to a forest.

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you up to today?

106
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a celebration.

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What kind of celebration?

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What kind of celebration do you usually bring?

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is it a tepura?

110
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is it a cake?

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a delicious toro cake.

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's a bad guy.

113
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's a bad guy.

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What is it?

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You came all the way here.

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you going to do?

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to do something useful.

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right.

119
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to do something useful.

120
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We're people who can only think about other people's bodies.

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You've helped me a lot.

122
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What are you going to do?

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'd like you to lend me some money today.

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're causing me trouble.

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't help you at all.

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't need your help.

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You came all the way here.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'd like you to lend me 2 million yen.

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'd like you to do something useful.

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What are you up to with 2 million yen?

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Today, I'm going to look up the power of the new house.

133
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why are you looking up the power?

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's been half a year since I built the house.

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I thought it would be a little dangerous.

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's a mistake.

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Koji?

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Koji.

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'd like you to look into it.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll ask someone to do it.

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no, no.

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you talking about?

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What are you talking about?

144
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Downtown is about looking up the power.

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Originally.

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, yeah.

147
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're looking up the power.

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a direct translation.

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Downtown.

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a suburb.

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.

152
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm looking up the power.

153
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can I drink the coffee you put in?

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The cameraman is angry.

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't drink coffee.

156
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
First of all, you use a vacuum cleaner.

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you use a vacuum cleaner, you use a lot of electricity.

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But it's okay now.

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's okay.

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And here.

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Use a stove.

162
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't need it now.

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's hot.

164
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Use a stove.

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll make it the best.

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
680W.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I brought a lot of stuff.

169
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then.

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, that's nice.

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
There's rice in it.

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There's rice in it.

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's nice.

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But it's hot because I turned on the stove.

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's hot.

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's turn on the fan.

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's turn on the fan.

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Should I turn it on?

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, not yet.

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think it's okay.

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is it electric?

182
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Electricity.

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's okay to do that.

184
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's turn on the mixer.

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's stronger than I thought.

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's strong.

187
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's strange.

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And then.

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Use a dryer.

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's still working.

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's no mistake.

192
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's nice.

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm tired.

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're tired because you've been here for a long time.

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm tired.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll give you a massage.

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why are you so serious?

198
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll give you another massage.

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's still working.

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's still working.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where are you going?

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Where are you going?

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Chiichi.

204
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is it?

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm doing something useless.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm doing something useless.

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm doing it for you.

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's turn on the dryer.

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's turn on the dryer.

210
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's still working.

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's still working.

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There's a lot of laundry.

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There's a lot of laundry.

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's do this.

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's set the timer.

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How much electricity do we have left?

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's been about 9 years.

218
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It doesn't fly much.

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you want to blow up our electricity?

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't want to blow it up.

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go to the microwave.

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Switch on.

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's working.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you doing?

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, no.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Chiichi, it's pitch black.

227
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Everyone watching TV today, it's pitch black.

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's say goodbye.

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you very much.

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm Chiichi's otaku.

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you very much.

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you eating?

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you eating?

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What are you putting on your teeth?

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why is it so dark?

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There's seaweed on it.

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You must have eaten something.

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's just vinegar.

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You must have eaten something.

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Didn't I say that?

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm nervous because I'm on TV.

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm nervous because I'm on TV.

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're nervous.

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're the one who's nervous.

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There's a theme today.

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's a big legend.

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's a big deal.

248
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm doing it today with the theme of raising my waist.

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's good.

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Today's guest is no big deal.

251
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't say that.

252
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry, but this is the time when I can respond to my body.

253
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a big deal.

254
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a big deal.

255
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think it's been 24 hours since I started this.

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's right.

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sure you're doing it now.

258
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sure you're doing it now.

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sure you're doing it now.

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's tough.

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think I have a strange organ.

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think I have a strange organ.

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I can't see anything wrong with my body.

264
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I have a bad artificial dick.

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're saying that artificial dick is bad.

267
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're saying that artificial dick is bad.

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're saying that artificial dick is bad.

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Stop it.

270
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's go to the toilet.

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't want to.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have to do it.

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But I'm watching you.

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I hate today's guest.

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What do you hate?

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What do you hate?

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Look at him.

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Everyone's looking at me.

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Everyone's looking at me.

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't mean to say it in a bad way.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's dirty.

283
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's dirty.

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's dirty.

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's better to be dirty than dirty.

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's better to be dirty than dirty.

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's dirty.

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If anyone says it's dirty, it's not good.

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If anyone says it's dirty, it's not good.

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What do you do?

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What do you do?

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You don't say dirty people are clean.

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're the guy who's really dirty, but you don't say it's clean.

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're the guy who's really dirty, but you don't say it's clean.

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What do you say?

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What do you say?

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They're all dirty.

298
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're not talking about a girl who's full of dicks.

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:37,540
It's the swimming

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
you're talking about.

301
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
You know, it looks like...

302
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
You always come out with two guys, right?

303
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes

304
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, you're in charge of the guys, you're in charge of the ugly ones

305
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
But you come out with two guys

306
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I do that

307
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,500
When you come out, the fans are really big

308
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
It's different today

309
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
When I come out, most of the people's eyes are like this

310
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Why?

311
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
When you talk, they look at you, when I talk, they look at me

312
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
No, no, no, you're a guest from Hamada

313
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Look, look, look, look at that

314
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I think I'm a little crazy

315
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
What are you going to ask?

316
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Which one do you want me to ask?

317
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
If you're going to care about that

318
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I know

319
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I really know

320
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Really?

321
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Yes, yes

322
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
What?

323
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Which one do you want me to ask?

324
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Are you going to ask one by one?

325
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,500
It's going to take time

326
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,500
It's better to ask in front of you, isn't it?

327
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Which one do you want me to ask?

328
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Which one do you want me to ask?

329
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,500
You're the first one, why are you glaring at me?

330
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
You have a bad taste

331
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
What are you eating?

332
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Are you going to use it as food?

333
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Give me a theme

334
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
If there is no theme, I can't do it

335
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
When you're tired, if there is no theme

336
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Favorite food

337
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm originally a seafood bowl person

338
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I'm not a seafood bowl person

339
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
What is it?

340
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm a human being

341
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm originally a good boy

342
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm a good boy

343
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm a good boy

344
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Food too

345
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Food was pretty noisy

346
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:19,500
The food I liked the most was chikuwa

347
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
It's a high-class food

348
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I put cucumber in chikuwa

349
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,500
You're a sticky man

350
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,500
That's delicious

351
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,500
The people are different

352
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I've been to a lot of places

353
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
You've been to me?

354
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I've been to China

355
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
China?

356
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
I've been to Fujian, China

357
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
You've been to Fujian, China

358
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Me? I've been to China

359
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
He went to Starwars

360
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
He went to Starwars

361
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
He went to China

362
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:19,600
He went to Hahar

363
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:19,500
He went to China

364
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
verified

365
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:20,500
went to China

366
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:20,500
he went to China

367
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Melissa

368
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Yes, the rice ball that you hold with the right hand of your right-hand man.

369
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Let's move on to the next one.

370
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
What the hell are you laughing at?

371
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500
What the hell are you laughing at?

372
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,500
You often say MVP in the award ceremony. What does MVP mean?

373
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I have no idea.

374
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
It doesn't mean nothing.

375
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
That's true.

376
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
For example, if you say Chuck YKK, it means something.

377
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Wait a minute. Chuck YKK?

378
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I didn't say anything.

379
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,500
YKK means something to Chuck.

380
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Can you tell me?

381
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Sure.

382
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Do you want to hear it?

383
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Please.

384
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
But it has nothing to do with this.

385
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
No, no, no.

386
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
What does YKK mean?

387
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Our...

388
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
K

389
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Kid

390
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
What do you mean by our kid?

391
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Our

392
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Young

393
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Our?

394
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Yes, yes.

395
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
We are

396
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
KID

397
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
KID

398
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Always

399
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Always

400
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
KID

402
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Always

403
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
That's what it means.

404
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
What?

405
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
I'm a big shot.

406
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm a big shot.

407
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Right?

408
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
That's what it means.

409
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
That's enough.

410
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Tell me about MVP.

411
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I want to hear about MVP.

412
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I want to hear about it.

413
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
What do you think?

414
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I don't know.

415
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Please tell me.

416
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
MVP

417
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Everyone

418
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
That's good.

419
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
MVP

420
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Everyone

421
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Everyone

422
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
V

423
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Surprised

424
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
That's good.

425
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
P

426
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
P

427
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Let's repeat it.

428
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Think about it.

429
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Everyone

430
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Everyone

431
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Everyone

432
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Everyone

433
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
V

434
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Surprised

435
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Surprised

436
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
P

437
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's go to the pool.

438
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I don't want to go to the pool.

439
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
People often say that eel and umeboshi are bad for your stomach.

440
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Why is that?

441
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Why is that?

442
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
People say that it hurts their stomach.

443
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
It's the same as eating.

444
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
It's the same as eating.

445
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
It's the same as eating.

446
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
It's the same as eating.

447
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
What happens is...

448
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
For example,

449
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
There is a dressing room.

450
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I'll put you in there.

451
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Please put me in there.

452
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I'll put you in there.

453
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,500
This is the situation when I ate eel and umeboshi.

454
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
When I opened the dressing room,

455
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I was talking to the side.

456
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Who? Who? Who?

457
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
If you come into my dressing room...

458
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
You never talk.

459
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
What happens?

460
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
What happens if I put you in one of the dressing rooms and lock you up?

461
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
What happens?

462
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
In the end, they fought and clashed with each other.

463
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Can you break this place?

464
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
They jumped out.

465
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
It's a so-called kick.

466
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Now...

467
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
You've said it well.

468
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Why doesn't the lens bubble?

469
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I don't know.

470
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
In the past,

471
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Lenses used to bubble like this.

472
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
In the past, why did you put hot water in the water dispenser?

473
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You're good.

474
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm sorry.

475
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Why doesn't the lens bubble?

476
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm sticking it.

477
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
What do you mean by sticking it?

478
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Your bad breath is all over the place.

479
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Can you say something like that?

480
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
You can't always say something like that.

481
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
What's wrong with you?

482
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I can't do it anymore.

483
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Wait.

484
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
If you say something like that, I can't say it anymore.

485
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

486
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Why can't you say something like that?

487
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Why doesn't the lens bubble?

488
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
It's because the bubble burst.

489
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Damn it.

490
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Even if the audience cheats me...

491
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Hama-chan comes out in various fashions every time.

492
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Why do you wear the same clothes every time?

493
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
You...

494
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,500
You look like a fashion leader right now.

495
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I'm not.

496
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
You have to be careful.

497
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
I haven't changed at all.

498
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
What I'm aiming for is antique.

499
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,500
For example, if you wear the latest fashion clothes.

500
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
It's okay now.

501
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
It's cool.

502
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
You think you're a leader, right?

503
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500
10 years later, 20 years later, you'll be laughed at.

504
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
For example, Masatoshi Nakamura.

505
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
He was cool back then.

506
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Now that I think about it, it's terrible.

507
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
It's like Uchimaki Carl.

508
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
That's a total...

509
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,500
It's like a ragged rapper jean.

510
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
But he's back.

511
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
He's back with a rapper jean.

512
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Giba-chan used to say,

513
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Soiya! Soiya!

514
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
That's not embarrassing.

515
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
It's embarrassing.

516
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,500
He used to say, Soiya!

517
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Who said, Soiya?

518
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Let's do it again.

519
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Don't take it off.

520
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Can I ask you one thing?

521
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,500
What do you like about Hamada-kun?

522
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
That was...

523
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
It's not funny.

524
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,500
The video is playing.

525
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
What do you like about him?

526
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Let's ask him.

527
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Sure.

528
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,500
What do you like about him?

529
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Everything.

530
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Everything?

531
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Well, when I'm in the second place.
