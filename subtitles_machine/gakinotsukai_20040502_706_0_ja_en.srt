1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What are you doing?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I quit.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You didn't?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No, I didn't.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You didn't smoke?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, I didn't smoke at all.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Can you stop smoking?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you have a cigarette?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You didn't smoke at all?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I didn't smoke at all.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You didn't smoke at all?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I didn't smoke at all.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That was fast.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That was pretty fast.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You don't trust me.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You don't trust me.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What happened?

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yamazaki-san asked me to bring everyone here.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Everyone's been calling you out lately.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's a lot.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's not like you're that popular.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Where are you going?

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's close by.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please start.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll hold it here.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you feeling down?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Here it comes.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Here's the first shot.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm feeling down.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you angry?

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm feeling down.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good morning.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's wrong?

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm Yosei Yamazaki.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Nice to meet you.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What's wrong?

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry for calling you out.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That was funny.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What was funny?

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I called you out.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That was funny.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It wasn't funny at all.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yamazaki-san, you're feeling down.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm feeling down.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why?

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As a comedian, I don't think I can do it.

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's too late.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What do you mean it's too late?

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Did you know about the NS broadcast?

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, I did.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was seven days ago.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
At that time, at the library...

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What?

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At the library...

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
At the library?

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
At the library?

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You called it a library, and I called it Choco Choco.

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't believe it.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
At the library.

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
At the library, there was a broadcast, and you all played a penalty game, right?

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, we did.

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't get a single point.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I didn't get a single point either.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hamada-san is good.

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why?

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hamada-san is the best, so he can't get a single point.

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is that so?

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't get a single point.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I see.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I didn't get a single point.

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In a sense, I didn't get a single point.

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't get a single point.

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's true. It's true.

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A comedian can only experience it as an event.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There is a moment when God descends.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
However, Yamasaki has recently been blessed by the God of laughter.

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Last week, a silent library was held at the Ernest Host.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The penalty game is decided by drawing a card and who hits the skull.

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a game that depends on luck.

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As you can see, the number of people who hit the skull is the same.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hamada and Yamasaki didn't get a single point.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Everyone, please think about it.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yamasaki, whose reactions are life, doesn't get a penalty.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This means the end of his life as a comedian.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
To be honest, I think the TV director who uses me now is incompetent.

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's too much.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't have anything.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't say that.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't have anything.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I wasn't that funny in school.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is that so?

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's okay.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I haven't done it for years.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Bring it to me.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll show you how much God has blessed me.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll show you how much God has blessed me.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll show you how much God has blessed me.

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've seen it.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've seen it.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's a lot of wasabi in there.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's the most obvious.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's the easiest to understand.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll do it.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here I go.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's good.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really?

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, well.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's good.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, well.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's difficult.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Me?

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not making fun of you.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not making fun of you.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're ruining it.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're ruining it.

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're ruining it.

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What a fool!

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're ruining it.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're ruining it.

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is a giant balloon.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I see.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's made of hose.

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's ruined.

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's ruined.

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's split in half.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's split in half.

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's split in half.

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's split in half.

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.1

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You don't need a hat

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He doesn't know that

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He doesn't have a delicacy

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This has nothing to do with talent and staff

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you ready?

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's go

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's leaking

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What?

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Amazing

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was 1 in 2

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It was funny

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's see the host

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's like this

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's scary

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's terrible

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's dangerous

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is this?

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's the best in the world

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There are darts

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My parents throw darts like this

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If there is a god, it will leak

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is good

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is the best

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What?

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are the best

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Are you laughing?

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not laughing

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's do it

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is my house

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where is it?

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is Tonga Shoto

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tonga Shoto

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not funny

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Tonga Shoto is funny

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a good place

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's not

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's Tonga Shoto

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Tonga Shoto

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are the best

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's do it

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My house is here

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Where is it?

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The name is weird

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's the Earth

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think so

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yamazaki

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yamazaki

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Zaki

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's funny

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's okay

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't go to places like this

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Come on

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What is this?

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There is helium gas in Japan

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you drink helium gas, your voice changes

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a funny voice

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's introduce ourselves

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This way

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Left

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's go

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's end this

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hello

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was expecting this

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are right

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's go

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hurry up

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's do it

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What is this?

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What is this?

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There are 10 T-shirts

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There are many interesting things

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Which one do you want?

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This one

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Number 2

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's do it

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm looking forward to it

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's go

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Look

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What is this?

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's weird

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Japan TV

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Japan TV

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's amazing

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Try it

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can see how much I'm doing

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Tanaka is doing it

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Tanaka is doing it

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You are like a character

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Look to the right

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's funny

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's funny

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What is this?

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's funny

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a coincidence

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's not a coincidence

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a terrorist

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's funny

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's not a coincidence

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know it

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know if this will be popular

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not a problem

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Kamu

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What is this?

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a talent maker

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The person I hate is this person

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There are many people

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's amazing

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The person I hate is this person

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yamato Yoshitake

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know him

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He is from Kumamoto

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I feel sorry for him

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The person I hate is this person

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The person I hate is this person

256
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Who is it?

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It was close

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It was close

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's amazing

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's amazing

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It was close

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was close

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's amazing that you opened this page

264
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's amazing

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a love between the police and the police

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's Heshiki Keigo

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's funny

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's like this

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not like it's not funny

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I got it

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I got it

272
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You didn't get it

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's not like that

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Kamu

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's terrible today

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's all behind the scenes

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What is this?

278
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's a polaroid

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There is only one film

280
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There is a funny face in front of it

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When the paper comes down, it comes out

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I got it

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Let's go

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Start

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
12 seconds

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What is it?

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I got it

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It was a funny face

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It depends on how you see it

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It depends on the angle

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There is a funny face

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's not bad

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not bad

294
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's like an old comedian

295
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's like watching from the stage

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's funny

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's funny

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Is it good?

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's play badminton

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Kamu

301
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What is it?

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What is it?

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There is a scene

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I got it

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I got it

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's a scene

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's a scene

308
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's a scene

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's a scene

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It depends on how you see it

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It depends on how you see it

312
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Which one?

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This one

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's go

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Get the sushi

316
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Get the sushi

317
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Get the T-shirt

318
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Get the sushi

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's go

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's go

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It hurts

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's go

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's do it

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Good luck

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
5 seconds

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:30,000
4, 3, 2, 1

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I've never seen this before

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've never seen this before

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a machine

331
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm scared

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's a scene

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's a scene

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's a scene

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Get out

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a scene

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's go

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a scene

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's a scene

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yama-chan, I've prepared the sushi

341
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm in a hurry

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It was fun

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's do badminton

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't do badminton

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm in a hurry

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm in a hurry

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is a half

348
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What are you going to do?

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is a normal woman

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm going to dance tango

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's go

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's a long one

353
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You can see the tango

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's a long one

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You can see the tango

356
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a long one

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's a long one

358
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Bring the sushi

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a long one

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Take off your T-shirt

361
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Take off your T-shirt

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The T-shirt was too much

363
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm hungry

364
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's go

365
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What is this?

366
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What is this?

367
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's a bomb

368
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a bomb

369
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's a bomb

370
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's go

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Number 3

372
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Can you do it?

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's a long one

374
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's a long one

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's a long one

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Take off your T-shirt

377
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I was born

378
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What is this?

379
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a long one

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a long one

381
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a long one

382
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's a long one

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hello

384
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's coming

385
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's go

386
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's coming

387
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's coming

388
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's coming

389
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's coming

390
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Isn't it enough?

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's go outside

392
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's easy for Kami to be there

393
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yamasaki is going to go outside and call Kami

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What are you going to do?

395
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Please let me have the last game

396
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What is it?

397
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I asked the staff to make a hole here

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
There is only one hole here

399
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm going to drop it in a minute

400
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's funny

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Let's go

402
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let's go

403
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's a long one

404
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's a long one

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's a long one

406
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a long one

407
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
20 seconds

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We don't have time

409
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The dog ran away

410
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Where is the other one?

411
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We have to go to the other side

412
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's hot

413
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's over

414
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's over

415
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's over

416
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Zaki

417
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's cold

418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What is it?

419
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It didn't hit

420
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It didn't hit at all

421
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It fell where it was supposed to

422
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You are completely tired

423
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Thank you for watching
