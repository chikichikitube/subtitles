1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikichiki!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Suga Presents!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Buy it, buy it, win it all!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Arashi's Over the Top!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The four of us will form a team.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll face the general public.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's fight with our bare hands!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And then!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Within one hour of the time limit,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we'll win 10 games in a row!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If the five of us win two games in a row,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the prize money from Producer Suga will be...

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
100 million yen!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Amazing!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who do you think will be the strongest out of the five?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is out of the question.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't think so.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But we don't know who will win.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Maybe it'll be a girl or a boy, right?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If it's a girl or a boy, I'll go all out!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What is this?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All out?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's decide the order!

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The order decided by rock-paper-scissors is this!

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Matsumoto vs. Hamada vs. Endo vs. Tanaka vs. Yamasaki!

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you very much!

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It won't continue, right?

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not at all.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, we have a Japanese TV announcer,

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
announcer Terashima.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hello!

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello, I'm Terashima.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm in a neighborhood near your house.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm in a alley that's one step away from the main street.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
From here, you have to find the target you've chosen.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The next person to enter the alley is Matsumoto.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The next person to enter the alley is me.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The first person to enter the alley is...

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is this the alley?

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll be waiting for you.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The alley is out.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is the mother who went out.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The first person to enter the alley is...

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is Moka here?

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Moka is here.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is bad!

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is a Japanese TV announcer.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is a little...

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm playing a game on a TV program.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have a little time left.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll be done in about five minutes.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is that okay?

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This person is okay, right?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's go!

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The first person to enter the alley is Matsumoto's employee, Akira Kuwata.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which one do you want?

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm right-handed.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't care.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go!

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm right-handed.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hold this here.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can win with this feeling.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ready...

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Go!

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay!

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I won!

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I still have one more win.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You did it!

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You have to win at least one round.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can't do the second round.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It hurts so much.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't do three or four rounds like this.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't do it.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're going to lose.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm next, right?

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The next person to enter the alley is a girl.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The second person to enter the alley is Nakayami Hota.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yamazaki is dangerous.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not dangerous.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm a man.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yamazaki looks dangerous.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not dangerous.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can't do it anymore.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yamazaki, do you want to enter the alley?

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you want to enter the alley?

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's do that.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's choose between Yamazaki and Hamada.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Which one do you think you can win?

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Me or Yamazaki?

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which one do you think you can win?

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I won!

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yamazaki suddenly changes from Hamada to Hamada.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
One, two, three, go!

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What?

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
His legs are floating!

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Damn it.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hey!

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hey!

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Damn it!

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's with you?

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why are you doing that?

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're not a king at all.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not a king.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is bad.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Did you win?

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I won, but...

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Alright!

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Two wins!

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, well...

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, are you serious?

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Terashima!

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Bring the next one in.

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The next one in, right?

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The opponent of the three consecutive wins is Toshio Yaragiya, a company employee.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is interesting.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is interesting.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, well, well.

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But, you know...

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I didn't have that much of a heartache.

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't say that!

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just shut up!

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll give you some advice!

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ready...

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Go!

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm counting on you!

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Damn it!

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Damn it!

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Damn it!

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That was...

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That was crazy!

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Damn it!

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You only have 36 minutes left.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
36 minutes?

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, really?

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't lose anymore.

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Alright, alright.

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I won't let you win.

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Alright.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The first round begins with a losing streak.

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okado Yujiyo is 60 years old.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ready...

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go!

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm counting on you!

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm counting on you!

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Damn it!

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Damn it!

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Damn it!

159
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Damn it!

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Damn it!

161
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're a 60-year-old dad!

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't lose!

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Alright.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then let's do two rounds with your dad.

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Next up is the high school girl, Fukushima Marisa.

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ready...

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go!

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh!

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Kenta, you're strong!

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That was close!

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Damn it!

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Damn it!

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Damn it!

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Damn it!

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That was close!

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You were trying to do it like Hamada-san.

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He was pushing you a lot.

178
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, he was pushing me a lot.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Seriously.

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That was close.

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The opponent of Yamasaki after the third round is the young student, Nakahara Takeo-san.

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ready...

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Go!

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Stop it!

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Stop it!

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It floated again!

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Damn it!

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Alright!

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But from here on, Endo wins the match.

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And Kanaka wins the match.

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And Hamada wins the match.

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That was the third round.

193
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Next, Matsumoto challenges for the fourth round.

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's do our best next time.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's my first time.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's my first time winning the fourth round.

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's true.

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The opponent of Matsumoto is the Karate student, Sato Tanahashi-san.

199
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I used to do Karate when I was in 11th grade.

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Seriously?

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's not even close.

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But it's 8-9.

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
8-9?

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You don't know how dark it is.

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's cute.

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's 8-9.

208
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's cute.

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's cute.

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's cute.

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's cute.

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's cute.

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's cute.

214
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's cute.

215
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's cute.

216
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's cute.

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's cute.

218
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's cute.

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's cute.

220
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's cute.

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's cute.

222
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's cute.

223
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's cute.

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What is this?

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I failed.

226
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:20,140
I got it right when you

227
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,220
tried fired me.

228
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
It's alright.

229
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,220
It's alright.

230
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
It's alright.

231
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
It's alright.

232
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
The fifth win, fifth win.

233
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
He managed to get the victory!

234
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,220
The second birdie, Endo vs. Kodama!

235
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,220
He managed to get the victory!

236
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,220
The next birdie, Tanaka vs. Takuha Ikuzaya!

237
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Tanaka won with his guts!

238
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,220
And Hamada won against a 70-year-old old man!

239
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
This is a great victory!

240
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Now, the prize of 300,000 yen is in the hands of Matsumoto!

241
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Let's just say this is it!

242
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,220
It's the last one!

243
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
Let's win!

244
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
It's the last one!

245
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,220
It's the challenger who spent the last 300,000 yen!

246
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Don't do that! Don't do that!

247
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Don't do that!

248
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Don't do that!

249
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Don't do that!

250
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Don't do that!

251
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Don't do that!

252
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,220
He said it's okay!

253
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,220
He won!

254
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,220
The final birdie, Matsumoto vs. Roger Smith!

255
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,220
What is this?

256
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,220
Who wrote this?

257
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,220
The person who wrote it.

258
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
What is this?

259
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Do your best!

260
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Think about it!

261
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Ready, go!

262
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
He's laughing!

263
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
He's laughing!

264
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,220
That's not cool!

265
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
That's not cool!

266
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
What is this?

267
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,220
What is this?

268
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
That's not cool!

269
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
That's not cool!

270
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Defeat him already!

271
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
This is a living hell!

272
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Think about it!

273
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
If you can't do it, do it quickly!

274
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
You're embarrassing me!

275
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,220
The final birdie, Matsumoto vs. Roger Smith!

276
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
This is...

277
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,220
This is strange!

278
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
Everyone is useless!

279
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,220
Thank you!

280
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,220
This kind of mission is useless!

281
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,220
Thank you!

282
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:52,220
The final birdie, Matsumoto vs. Roger Smith!

283
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,220
I don't know if you're doing well today.

284
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm doing well!

285
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Really?

286
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
I was listening behind your back.

287
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
What's wrong?

288
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
You were doing it with a blue face.

289
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
I'm not looking at your face.

290
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,220
It's okay to smile, but a smiley face is ugly.

291
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
Everyone is like that.

292
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
A smiley face?

293
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
It's ugly, right?

294
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
It's not ugly.

295
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
You're dirty!

296
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Are you stupid?

297
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,220
Turn off the camera.

298
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,220
It's not good at all.

299
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,220
I don't know about today.

300
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
I'm starting to hate it.

301
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
Why?

302
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,220
I happened to watch the on-air last week.

303
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
I talked to Yoko-san yesterday.

304
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
Last week too.

305
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
We talked for almost an hour.

306
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220
There's no on-air for 10 minutes.

307
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
It's okay today.

308
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Today's opening is not that long, right?

309
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Today's opening is not that long, right?

310
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
That's right.

311
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
In terms of time.

312
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
It's just right.

313
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
I see.

314
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
But I'm not in the mood to talk.

315
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,220
I don't know if this was on-air.

316
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,220
I haven't checked the on-air.

317
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
I don't know.

318
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
There's a cockroach in my house.

319
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
You knew, didn't you?

320
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Since then, I've been in perfect shape.

321
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
I can go anytime.

322
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,220
I can go anytime.

323
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
I can go anytime.

324
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,220
I can go anytime.

325
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
I can go anytime.

326
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
I can go anytime.

327
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
I can go anytime.

328
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
I can go anytime.

329
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
I've never seen a cockroach since then.

330
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I don't know why.

331
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
I dreamt...

332
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I dreamt...

333
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
A big cockroach appeared.

334
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,220
It was about two meters long.

335
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,220
He said, you said that to me on TV, didn't you?

336
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,220
I see.

337
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
I was really scared.

338
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
That's scary.

339
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
It's really scary, isn't it?

340
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,220
When I said yes, I thought I might get hit, so I said no.

341
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,220
He said, don't say it too much.

342
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,220
I forgot how many times I said it.

343
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
I said, don't say it too much.

344
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,220
After that, he stopped breathing.

345
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,220
I see.

346
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
What is this?

347
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,220
If there was one, there should be a lot, right?

348
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,220
There should be a lot, but I think that's what happened that night.

349
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,220
That's what happened?

350
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,220
No, no, no.

351
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
That's why I said, it's okay.

352
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,220
Matsumoto, it's okay.

353
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,220
Matsumoto, you can play in the kitchen.

354
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
What is this?

355
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Why do you want it?

356
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,220
No, it doesn't make sense.

357
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
I think that's what happened.

358
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,220
Stop it!

359
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
No, it's not like that.

360
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,220
If it's funny, I'll laugh, but I don't know what you're talking about.

361
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
I see.

362
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Wait a minute.

363
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
What?

364
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
It's not funny?

365
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
It's okay.

366
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Even so, you shouldn't play it like that.

367
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,220
One button, one story, two buttons.

368
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
Don't underestimate me.

369
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Well, there are a lot of things today.

370
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,220
What do you have now?

371
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Is it soccer?

372
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Soccer?

373
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,220
But I'm sorry, but I haven't watched the other day's show.

374
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
I don't really care about soccer.

375
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm not really interested in it.

376
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Besides, I don't like talented people who show off.

377
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
Talented people who show off.

378
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,220
I've been rooting for someone like that for a long time.

379
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,220
Have you ever said that you're a soccer player?

380
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,220
I've been saying it for a long time.

381
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,220
I've liked soccer for a long time, so I don't really care about people who say it.

382
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Isn't it just people like that?

383
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
It's not just people like that.

384
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Then who is it?

385
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
It's someone like that.

386
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Is that so?

387
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,220
Wait, wait, wait.

388
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
It's hard to understand.

389
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,220
What is it?

390
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
It's someone like that.

391
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,220
Wait, wait, wait.

392
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
I don't really understand.

393
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,220
What is it?

394
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:20,220
It's someone like that.

395
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,220
Why do you have to say it out loud?

396
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Don't say it out loud.

397
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
What is it?

398
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,220
It's someone like that.

399
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,220
But that's true.

400
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,220
There was a match on Sports Newspaper the other day.

401
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,220
It was a color match.

402
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,220
But that was an interview, right?

403
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,220
The press was watching it.

404
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
No, I don't think that's true.

405
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,220
It's because they were doing this with a megaphone.

406
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
They were looking at the TV.

407
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,220
Where did they take that photo?

408
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,220
That was an interview.

409
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
That's a lie.

410
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,220
They weren't doing it while watching soccer.

411
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
They were shooting it a few days ago.

412
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
So it was an interview.

413
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,220
It was an interview.

414
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
But it had nothing to do with soccer.

415
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,220
They were shooting it the day before the match.

416
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
But it was on the screen.

417
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
It wasn't on the TV.

418
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
It was only on the back of the TV.

419
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Is that so?

420
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Yes, it was definitely a magic trick.

421
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,220
I don't like that.

422
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
I don't like songs.

423
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
Everyone says they like soccer, right?

424
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,220
I've never seen an announcer say, I'm not interested.

425
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
But I'm sure there are announcers.

426
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,220
Even though there are announcers, everyone doesn't like soccer.

427
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
That's true.

428
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Why do you say it like that?

429
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
It's like a hot meal.

430
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
It's like a hot meal.

431
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Why is it so perfect for a hot meal?

432
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
That's good.

433
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
It's good if it's perfect.

434
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
That's right.

435
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,220
No one can be a keeper.

436
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,220
It's not a special skill or anything.

437
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
A special skill?

438
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
You can do it like this.

439
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
But if it comes...

440
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
If it comes straight, it's like this.

441
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
If it comes like this, it's like this.

442
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
If it comes like this, it's like this.

443
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,220
If it comes like this, it's like this.

444
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
It's like this.

445
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,220
It's like this.

446
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
It's like this.

447
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
I see.

448
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
Why is it like that?

449
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
What is that?

450
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
You can't take that.

451
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Really?

452
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
If it's practice, people will understand.

453
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
How do you practice as a keeper?

454
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,220
You have to kick and take it.

455
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
If you don't, you can't practice.

456
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,220
But no matter how many steps you take, you can take what you can take.

457
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
You can't reach what you can't reach.

458
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
It can't be helped.

459
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,220
If there is a way to practice that you can do it easily, you can do it.

460
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,220
You can take what you can take, but you can't take what you can't take.

461
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
That's true.

462
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
You don't have to practice.

463
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
You can't do it even if you're an old man.

464
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
That's impossible.

465
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
That's impossible.

466
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
Why?

467
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Old men do it like this.

468
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
They have a lot of defense.

469
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,220
But old men have a lot of defense, but they're slow.

470
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
No, no.

471
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
They're fast.

472
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,220
If you say they're fast, they're slow.

473
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
If you say they're fast, they're slow.

474
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
If you say they're fast, they're slow.

475
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,220
If they're big, they'll be okay.

476
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,220
If they're big, they're slow.

477
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
What are you talking about?

478
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,220
They're big enough to reach the goal.

479
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,220
That's not true.

480
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
That's not true.

481
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Are you serious?

482
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
Are you serious?

483
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
I can't say that.

484
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
If you say they're big, they're big.

485
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
That's stupid.

486
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
You!

487
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Osmo-san says that if you hold a baby, it will grow healthily.

488
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,220
If you hold a baby, how does it grow?

489
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
I say that a lot.

490
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,220
I say, hold me, hold me.

491
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,220
It's like the escape scene of Osmo-tori.

492
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
I see.

493
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
There's something like that.

494
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Yes, yes.

495
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
I don't think this is a lie.

496
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Is that so?

497
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,220
I've been drawn to Osmo-tori.

498
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
That's a different meaning.

499
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Damn it!

500
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
I couldn't resist it.

501
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
I'll play with you.

502
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Yes, yes.

503
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Crying and laughing, crying and laughing.

504
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
I can't think of anything.

505
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
I can't laugh.

506
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
Yes.

507
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,220
I still have the answer to the question about holding a baby.

508
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Stop it!

509
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
It was a normal answer.

510
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
It was a normal answer.

511
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,220
The question is, Osmo-san, if you hold a baby, how does it grow?

512
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
It will get sick.

513
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Why?

514
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:15,220
The other day, at Itao's wedding party, you beat up Hong Kong's son.

515
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
That's not true.

516
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
How many months has it been? Hong Kong's son.

517
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
He said, hey!

518
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Hey!

519
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Bang!

520
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
How many times do I have to do it?

521
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,220
When a man approaches, he immediately cries.

522
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
That's not true.

523
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
That's not true.

524
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
What's not true?

525
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
I heard a voice saying, poor thing.

526
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
That's not true.

527
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
What is it?

528
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
It's the same for everything.

529
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Don't look at my part.

530
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
I want to say this.

531
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
What do you mean?

532
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,220
Certainly, in front of you, I hit Hong Kong's son's head.

533
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,220
But in front of you, I was doing the same thing to Hong Kong's son.

534
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,220
That's not true.

535
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
I can't go anywhere without being hugged.

536
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Did he start to move?

537
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
That's not true.

538
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,220
He's not cute at all.

539
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,220
Even though he can't talk, he's not cute at all.

540
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,220
If he talks, he's even cuter.

541
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
That's not true.

542
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,220
At that age, he can't do anything.

543
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
That's not true.

544
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
Hey! Hey!

545
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
Even though he can't talk, he's not cute at all.

546
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
That's not true.

547
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,220
That's why I hit his shoulder.

548
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
Hey!

549
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
I'm scared of his face.

550
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Bang!

551
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
That's why everyone is happy.

552
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,220
In the old days, there were three-step jumping and seven-step jumping.

553
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,220
I heard there were four more after hop, step, and jump.

554
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Mr. Matsumoto, please tell us the remaining four steps.

555
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Yes.

556
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,220
In the old days, the food was getting better and better, and the training was more expensive.

557
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
That's right.

558
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
Compared to the old days, I gained a lot of muscle strength.

559
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
That's right.

560
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,220
When that happened, I had to do hop, step, and jump.

561
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
If I didn't do that, I would go too far.

562
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
So I decided to go to a meeting.

563
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
You went too far?

564
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
I decided to go to a public meeting.

565
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
A public meeting?

566
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Well, I decided to go to a public meeting.

567
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,220
You went too far?

568
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Yes.

569
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
I went to China and France.

570
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,220
I didn't go to China, but I decided to go to France.

571
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
You didn't say anything about Japan?

572
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
I didn't say anything about Japan.

573
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
It seems that I was brainwashed.

574
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
I didn't know about the seven-step jumping.

575
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
It's called Taisho-democracy.

576
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
The remaining four...

577
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,220
Where is my Taisho-democracy going?

578
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,220
What?

579
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
My Taisho-democracy...

580
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,220
I just said it, right?

581
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Yes, yes.

582
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
You heard it, right?

583
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Yes, I heard it.

584
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Taisho-democracy, right?

585
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Yes, yes.

586
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
I said it, right?

587
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Yes, yes.

588
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
You should write something about it.

589
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Something like a blanket.

590
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,220
Otherwise, it will be too soft.

591
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,220
You'll catch a cold.

592
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
No, it's okay.

593
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
I've already made a decision.

594
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Well, you also mentioned that you had a headache before that.

595
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Yes, I did.

596
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
That girl is also wearing a blanket.

597
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
It's very soft.

598
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
The next Taisho-democracy is also very soft.

599
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,220
Write something about it.

600
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Yes, yes, I see.

601
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
Please.

602
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
Because my gags are catching a cold.

603
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
It means that it's cold.

604
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
It doesn't mean that it's cold.

605
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,220
It doesn't mean that it's cold!

606
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Please.

607
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
It's okay.

608
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
It's okay.

609
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
Please tell me the remaining four.

610
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
I'll tell you the remaining four.

611
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Okay, let's do it.

612
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
What? You're not going to do it?

613
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Hop, step, jump.

614
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,220
Please.

615
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
Hop!

616
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Step!

617
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
Jump!

618
00:23:48,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Oh, it's, it's, it's.

619
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Okay, let's do it.

620
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:22,220
Hop, step, jump.
