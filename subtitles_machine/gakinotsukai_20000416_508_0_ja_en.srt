00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's been a long time since I played a game like this.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's been 3 weeks.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
3 weeks of...

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Punishment.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We played a punishment game.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The reviews were good.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I see.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think it was good.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I see.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go to the post office.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The collar is standing up.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Cut it properly.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've been doing drama for a long time.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you make a mistake, there will be a murder case.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're not sleeping.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But everyone who does drama is like that.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's amazing. The schedule for the post office is 28 o'clock.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is that 28 o'clock?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's natural.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We studied 24 hours.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
28 hours.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
One day.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've been doing drama for a long time.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was open for about 4 hours.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I thought I'd take a nap here.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I went to the sauna.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't want to go to the sauna.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There was a place to sleep.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I wanted to take a nap.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I lay down.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What is that?

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What?

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There was a man without breathing.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do you mean?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was surprised.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I wanted to take a nap with a digital camera.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There was a man.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He was dead.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There was a man.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's scary.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But he was sleeping comfortably.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He didn't wake up.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He was dead at that moment.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He wasn't breathing.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He was doing it.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But he was dead at that moment.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He wasn't dead.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He was fighting.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He was fighting.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
His body was still alive.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
His body was still alive.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But he was dying.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I was surprised.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know if I'm breathing.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't do it.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are many people who breathe.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You do it too, right?

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't do it.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I do it.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I do it lightly.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't know what he did yesterday.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He snores.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sometimes he does this.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What is that?

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't do it.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to do it if I can.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But I can't do it.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The sound was like that.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He snores.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is normal.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the quietest.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sometimes he does this.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There were no other customers.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There were two people.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Except you.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There were two people except me.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He was noisy.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I thought he was bothering me.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I thought he was bothering me.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He was sleeping.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I didn't care about him.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This guy.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I see.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm definitely more tired than you.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Than him?

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You don't work when you wake up.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The money you earn is different.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm really sorry.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm tired.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My underwear is dirty.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tell me after you see if it's dirty.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He is definitely fat.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He is very fat.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He is fat.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have a lot of fat.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He is not fat.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Tell me at the end.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fat people don't have a sense of shame.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Fat people don't have a sense of shame.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There was a manager in Nozawa.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ishigori Meat.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He came to me in the morning.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He asked me to let him sleep.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He asked me to wake him up an hour before my show.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He said it was time.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I woke up and checked the clock.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was about three hours.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was an hour before my show.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's okay.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's funny.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did that happen?

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you have anything good to say?

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Fat people are usually like that.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The baseball game has started.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The baseball game has started.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The Giants are still winning.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Have you been winning all the time?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've been doing well lately.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've been saying that I hate baseball all the time.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I was hoping for the collapse of professional baseball.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But that's impossible.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I finally understood that it was impossible.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm going to be a fan of the Giants from this year.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's not true.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There are 12 baseball teams.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There are 12 baseball teams in the baseball game.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can choose one of them.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm going to be a fan of the Giants from this year.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm a fan of the Giants from this year.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Really?

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm a huge fan of the Giants.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm going to be a fan of Uehara this year.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going to be a fan of the baseball team.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's great.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can do it.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This year you joined the Giants in the FA division.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you know who is here?

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Of course I know.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm going to win the Giants this year.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because he came.

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because he came.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He's a bit big headed.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's not it.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He's a bit big headed.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ah, so he's a bit big headed.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He's from Hiroshima.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's here.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He's here.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's the guy who sold the 4th edition in Hiroshima.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The guy who sold the 4th edition is here.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's here.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's here.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't really like his hairstyle.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He's a bit of a Chirichiri Parma.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Chirichiri Parma?

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He's not a Chirichiri Parma.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's not a Chirichiri Parma, but...

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He's kind of like a Chirichiri Parma.

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right?

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you know which team won 2 points last year?

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Daiei.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ah, that's right.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I know about that.

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because you were a kid's servant.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The guy who was the ace there...

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The guy who was the ace there...

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's here.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He's here.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He's here.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I was happy.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was a happy day.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I want you to do it.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want you to do it.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I want you to throw a lot of shinkas.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Shinkas?

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want you to throw a lot of shinkas.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want you to study.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We're the same age.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We're the same age.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Nakamura.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's not Nakamura.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's not Nakamura, but I was thinking of calling you Nakamura.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I dared to.

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're wearing a dog.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I won that!

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't care if you call me Nakamura.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Nakamura.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll do it this year.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll do it this year.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll do it this year.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Maru Kano.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Maru Kano?

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Maru Kano was in Hankyu, right?

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Wasn't he there?

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No, no.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He was in Hankyu, right?

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Maru Kano.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There's no Hankyu Braves anymore.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's not what Maru Kano means now.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Really?

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Maru Kano means thank you.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Maru Kano means thank you?

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's like Maru at the end of the story.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, really?

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's okay.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm a W giant fan.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay, let's go.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Remember.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm also interested in soccer.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, soccer.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know soccer.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know soccer.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know soccer.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're talking about the Espans.

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A big fan?

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A big fan.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you say that, you're a big fan.

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There's no way you're a fan of the Espans.

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm tired of it.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're wearing dirty underwear.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're covered in dung.

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're covered in dung.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You don't know the name of the club, do you?

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, if you ask me, I don't know the name of the club.

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, then.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The Espans.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The Veltis.

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Do you know the Veltis?

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The Juvelo.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The Juvelo.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The F. Marinos.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The F. Marinos.

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like this.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't want to end it like this.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It can't be helped if you keep doing this.

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It can't be helped if you keep doing this.

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's over.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's really...

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's really hard.

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:43,640
This is a question for the world's best

254
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is a question for the world's best

255
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
stripper, Matsumoto-san.

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's a place like that.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
When you clean your room with a roller cleaner,

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
what sticks to it?

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What sticks to everyone?

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to ask the other way around.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think my world is normal.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I want to ask what sticks to everyone.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I see.

264
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think my world is normal.

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I see.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think my world is normal.

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's a bad thing to say.

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Including my sister?

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Including my sister?

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Including my sister?

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Including everything.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wait a minute.

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You live with your family, right?

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why are you drooling?

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We...

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We live alone.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We have an outlaw.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Ever since I left the bath,

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I've been drooling in the kitchen.

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's why I wash my hair.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because no one can see it.

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's right.

285
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You've never washed your hair with a roller cleaner, have you?

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It shakes a lot.

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like this.

288
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like this.

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
At the end, when the bubbles are thin,

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
it shakes a lot.

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You don't know that.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If I wash my hair with a roller cleaner,

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I usually don't tremble.

294
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've never washed my hair,

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but I dry my hair.

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
With a roller cleaner?

297
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because it's hot.

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If I dry my hair like this,

300
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
it shakes a lot.

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It shakes a lot.

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It shakes a lot, doesn't it?

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No, it doesn't.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When the cup is full of bubbles,

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
it shakes like this at the end.

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
At that time, it shakes a lot.

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You don't know that, do you?

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So we...

309
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're drooling in the bath,

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but before our wives and children give birth,

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
we don't drool that much.

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But still,

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you'll fall, won't you?

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why would I fall?

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you scratch something,

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
you'll fall, won't you?

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like a jersey.

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You'll fall, won't you?

319
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You'll fall, won't you?

320
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm an outlaw,

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
so I'll fall.

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Everywhere I go,

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
it's full of drool.

324
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I've fallen more than here.

325
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're the best in the world.

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're the best in the world.

327
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's why I...

328
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I have a lot of hair fall.

329
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If I do it like this.

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But...

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I have a lot of female hair fall, too.

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, I see.

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
In the world.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What?

335
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
In the world.

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You hate foreigners.

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, no.

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've met a lot of Australians,

339
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and people from other countries.

340
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If I do it like this,

341
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I have a lot of hair fall.

342
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It doesn't matter.

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I have a lot of hair fall.

344
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I have a lot of hair fall.

345
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have a lot of hair fall.

346
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I have a lot of hair fall.

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san,

348
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
who always smells fruity.

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Matsumoto-san, who always smells fruity.

350
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san,

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
who always smells fruity.

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What?

353
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Recently, Matsumoto-san has been

354
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
opposed to animal fortune-telling,

355
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and has been criticized for fruity fortune-telling.

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What kind of characteristic does Hamada-san have

357
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
when he praises fruits?

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think sushi fortune-telling is popular these days.

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's popular.

360
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, is that so?

361
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think I've said that once as a kid.

363
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I see.

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's just an excuse.

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How do you do sushi fortune-telling?

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, how do you do sushi fortune-telling?

367
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not asking you.

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How do you do the popular sushi fortune-telling?

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Matsumoto-san,

370
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
what kind of sushi do you like?

371
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Depending on the order,

372
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
what kind of sushi do you recommend?

373
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's stupid.

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's really true.

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Shut up.

376
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're the one who's stupid.

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, depending on the order you like?

378
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes, yes.

379
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I see.

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's how you choose.

381
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What you're doing is fruit fortune-telling.

382
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Fruit fortune-telling?

383
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
How do you do it?

385
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Fruit?

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you say the fruit you like?

387
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yours?

388
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't mind if it's mine.

389
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Do you say the fruit you like

390
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to the person you want to fortune-tell?

391
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes, that's right.

392
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's say you say it.

393
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's how you know, right?

394
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I know, I know.

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I see.

396
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then what's your favorite fruit?

397
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's right.

398
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You have to say it right away.

399
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
When you're thinking, that's a lie.

401
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I see, I see.

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What's your favorite fruit?

403
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Nothing.

404
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Nothing.

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You said nothing.

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I got it. Nothing.

408
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's how you know?

409
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Your eyes are twitching.

410
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's how you know?

411
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Nothing.

412
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can't say nothing.

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Then say three things.

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Nothing.

415
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Nothing.

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Strawberry.

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's gross.

418
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Peach.

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Peach.

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Nothing, strawberry, peach?

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Peach.

422
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What's your blood type?

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Type A.

424
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Type A?

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

426
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It doesn't look like that.

427
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Really?

428
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What did you find out?

429
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I found out a lot of things.

430
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's enough data for now.

431
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And it's until May, right?

432
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, until May.

433
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you put that data into my head now,

434
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the answer will come out of my mouth.

435
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You already put it in, right?

436
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I did.

437
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You did?

438
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then 3000 yen.

439
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Why are you taking my money?

440
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll take your money.

441
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please.

442
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You don't want to?

443
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know, right?

444
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I know.

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Please.

446
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I said I know!

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't be stupid.

448
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hurry up and say it.

449
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What do you mean?

450
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Listen to me first.

451
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What?

452
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Listen to my fruit.

453
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why do you have to listen to me?

454
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Am I that?

455
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Are you only interested in Matsumoto or Hamada?

456
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why aren't you interested in me?

457
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, no.

458
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Wait a minute.

459
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's what makes me angry.

460
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
No, no, no.

461
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What?

462
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm the only one who's interested in you.

463
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Do you think it's funny?

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you think it's funny?

465
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You're stupid.

466
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Listen to me.

467
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Then I'll answer you and that's it.

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Listen to me.

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then I'll answer you and that's it.

470
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're stupid.

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Then I'll take off my suit.

472
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, no.

473
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No one knows what a fortune-teller is.

474
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you don't answer me,

475
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
if I ask you,

476
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
how can I answer you?

477
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then tell me if you want to know or not.

478
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What do you want?

479
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tell me.

480
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Do you like me or hate me?

481
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you want to know or not?

482
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Then...

483
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Then...

484
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If you tell me how to answer,

485
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll ask you and that's it.

486
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I see.

487
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I understand.

488
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's a way.

489
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There's no way to answer.

490
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Everyone watching on TV,

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
if you have a notepad,

492
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
please give it to me.

493
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you have a notepad,

494
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
please give it to me.

495
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What about you?

496
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No.

497
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No.

498
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No.

499
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

500
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No.

501
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No.

502
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No.

503
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No.

504
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No.

505
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No.

506
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No.

507
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No.

508
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No.

509
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No.

510
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No.

511
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No.

512
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No.

513
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No.

514
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No.

515
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No.

516
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No.

517
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No.

518
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No.

519
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

520
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
N Broth An account of how many fruits Grown?

521
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If you have a notepad,

522
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
10 a thing.

523
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
That's right.

524
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's see how much you have.

525
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How many lot is a notepad?

526
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
How many one?

527
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Just it let me see it.

528
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,500
They just say this suddenly.

529
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
If they tell you before,

530
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll prepare for it too

531
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
Then, we have loss when we have lot of it.

532
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Of course we have that kind of thing.

533
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you use 1 N,

534
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you will choose 2.

535
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No 2.

536
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,600
Then if you keep

537
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
If you subtract 1 from that, it's 2, right?

538
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
And from there...

539
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
It's a lie!

540
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
The peach is left after the strawberry.

541
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
That's right.

542
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't know what to do with this.

543
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
You add the peach, right?

544
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Ah, you add it like this?

545
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
It becomes 43.

546
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I don't understand why it's 43.

547
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Why? It's noisy!

548
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
It's noisy, so what?

549
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
It becomes 43, right?

550
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
And in this case, 4 doesn't disappear.

551
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Only 3 remains.

552
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes.

553
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
What the hell is this?!

554
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Are you stupid?

555
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I'll call out your voice on the phone.

556
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I'll call out your voice on the phone.

557
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
It's difficult.

558
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
What?

559
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
What's the result?

560
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
It's 43, so 4 disappears, right?

561
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Ah, this one disappears.

562
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
4 disappears.

563
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Actually, this one disappears.

564
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
The fact that 3 appears means that it's a gorilla.

565
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
3 is a gorilla.

566
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
3 is a gorilla.

567
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
In this case...

568
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
In which case?

569
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I don't understand.

570
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
And you were born in May.

571
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Ah, May.

572
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Please add 5 to the gorilla born in May.

573
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Adding a gorilla is strange.

574
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I was told to add May and gorilla.

575
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
And what happens if you add a gorilla in May?

576
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
What happens if you add a gorilla in May?

577
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't understand.

578
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Why don't you understand?

579
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Did you get a lesson?

580
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I was told to add a gorilla in May.

581
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
If you add a gorilla in May, it's May, right?

582
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Does the number 3 earlier have nothing to do with it?

583
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
In this case, it disappears.

584
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,600
If you add a gorilla in May, it's May, right?

585
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Right?

586
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
If you don't understand here, you can't go to the next step.

587
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Right?

588
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Well, yes.

589
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
If you add a gorilla in May, it's May, right?

590
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Normally, you don't add it, right?

591
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
It's nothing like that.

592
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Normally, you don't add it?

593
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
If you add a gorilla in May...

594
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Then, what happens if you add a fish in August?

595
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
It's August, right?

596
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
It has nothing to do with animals and the moon, right?

597
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Originally, it's strange to add a gorilla in May, right?

598
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
You know that, right?

599
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
But I want to add a gorilla in May.

600
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
It's that kind of season.

601
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
May.

602
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I wonder if that's the answer.

603
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
But even if you add a gorilla in May, nothing happens, right?

604
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I know that you won't understand.

605
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
But I want to add a gorilla in May.

606
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It's a melancholic night.

607
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
It doesn't matter.

608
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Even if you add a gorilla in May, it doesn't mean anything.

609
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
It doesn't mean anything, but I want to add a gorilla in May.

610
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
If you say it doesn't mean anything, everything will be fine.

611
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I want to add a gorilla in May.

612
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
So I added a gorilla in May.

613
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,600
But as I thought, no matter how many times I add a gorilla, it's May.

614
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Gorillas are gorillas.

615
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
So please leave the gorilla here for a while.

616
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Yes, yes.

617
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
It will come out again later.

618
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Right?

619
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
And it's May, right?

620
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
And it's decided that it's May.

621
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
In other words, you were born in May.

622
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
So you can look for it in May.

623
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:28,600
It doesn't matter whether you like fruits or not.

624
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
It doesn't matter.

625
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,600
The result is the same, but there is an episode.

626
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Please look at the history.

627
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
History is something you decided on your own.

628
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
It's the same with gorillas.

629
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
No, no, no.

630
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
What did I say earlier?

631
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
There are gorillas here again.

632
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
You also put gorillas here on your own, right?

633
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
But gorillas are still here.

634
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
There are three gorillas.

635
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
If you say three, it's a gorilla.

636
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
You said it yourself.

637
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
There are gorillas, so be careful.

638
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
If you say three, it's a gorilla.

639
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
You said it yourself.

640
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
You said it yourself, so I'm coming.

641
