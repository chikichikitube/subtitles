1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What's so funny?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's so funny?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What's so funny?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's nothing funny.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
From now on too.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
From now on too.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What's so funny?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's so funny?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's so funny?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was driving in Daikanyama.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was driving in a car.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The car in front of me is a Donkusai.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, there's one.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There's one, right?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's not even a traffic light.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What is it?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When a pedestrian comes, it stops one by one.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's one.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When a pedestrian comes, it stops one by one.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It tells you to go faster.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How long are they going to wait?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Until it completely disappears.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's impossible.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The main street of Daikanyama.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But it's there.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It tells you to go faster.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then a car comes from behind.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's stop.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then it stops again.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I wasn't in the car behind me.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was in front of it.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In the end, it went away.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It went away.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I thought I was in front of it.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then it opened the window.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a foreigner.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a foreigner.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's 100% a foreigner.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's in beautiful Japanese.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's in beautiful Japanese.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought it was a lie.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I thought it was a lie.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you think of Tokyo as the center, you're obviously far away.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But that doesn't matter.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was said clearly.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a really bad foreigner.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll never lose.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a foreigner.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I was told by a guy who said,

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's this?

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm from the countryside.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I came from Osaka to Tokyo.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I came from Osaka to Tokyo.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're definitely from New Jersey.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a corner, isn't it?

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're just saying what you know.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm angry.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why did you know it was small?

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Because the seat is like this.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's like this.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shut up.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm from the countryside.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They're really proud.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, I guess so.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If I go abroad.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can't say that.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry for about a year.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right?

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I can't say that.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can't say that.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you say that, it's a foreign word.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you say that, it's going to be a big deal.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a close-in.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's too close.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's so close that you can wash it off.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a strange thing.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's no such thing.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They're really...

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They're proud of me.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They're proud of me.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was drunk in Roppongi.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There's a foreigner selling things.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That foreigner told me to go home when I was drunk.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's...

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm coming from a place that's obviously far from you.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, no, no.

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't worry.

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm drunk.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's right.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's easy, isn't it?

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's easy, isn't it?

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do you think?

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you think about the drama?

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't intend to complain.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, for the time being...

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Otaku-san is...

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're just two people.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We're just messing around.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's right.

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What do you think?

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, but...

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm nervous.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Who?

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Everyone.

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's red, isn't it?

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The East is red.

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The East...

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's like a period drama.

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The lines change.

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tanaka said it yesterday, too.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He has an acting plan.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In the East.

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm thinking about it in my hair.

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm thinking about it under my hair.

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This scene is like this.

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm going to move in this way.

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's what he thinks.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But it's going to be red.

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's why it's a period drama.

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sometimes he walks like this.

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If you think about it...

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He moves with his bare feet.

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If you think about it, he has a long acting career.

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's never done a drama before.

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a standard language.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's like he's doing a skit.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is that a standard language?

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, Kogoriko and Fujii are all standard languages.

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Really?

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Fujii is a standard language.

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But Fujii is sweating all the time.

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's been acting for a long time.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know if it's okay to act like that.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's sweating all the time.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's like a drinking heart.

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even if it's a real deluxe car, he's sweating like this.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's sweating like this.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like he's stuck in my hand and it's coming out.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's not good.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But his acting is a little strange.

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sometimes his standard language is strange.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You don't know the scene.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When I came, there were only two of us.

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've never seen anyone else acting.

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
To be honest, I'm scared.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait a minute.

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Have you ever done this before?

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've done it once.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The set on the first day is set in the 8th floor of Higashi.

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's sweating all the time.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's sweating all the time.

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't know what's going on.

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He's sweating all the time.

158
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you say that, it's your line.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you say it, I don't know what to do.

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm nervous when I see it.

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm used to it.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you okay?

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm nervous about the first and second episodes.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If I get used to it, I'll add some ad-libs to the lines.

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I don't think I can do it now.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't do it now.

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There was a scene in the tobacco space.

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I said something to Higashi at the end.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But Higashi is cold.

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then...

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You didn't hear it.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Obviously.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Cold?

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I said okay.

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you say okay?

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He appeared in a movie.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I didn't watch it.

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There was a bed scene.

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There was a woman on the bed.

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She wanted to rub her father.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
She wanted to rub her father.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She wanted to rub her father.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't do it like this.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't do it like this.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't do it like this.

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm scared.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please look forward to it.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In that sense?

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm nervous.

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you okay?

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You haven't been free yet.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm nervous.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can speak standard Japanese.

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can do it.

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can do it.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can do it.

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But I can't do it because everyone looks at me strangely.

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You look like a standard Japanese.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can do it if I speak standard Japanese.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can do it if I speak standard Japanese.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Please say something weird.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You guys don't talk to me.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't want to listen to you.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't like to be called cold.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He doesn't like it.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't like the feeling of a hole in my butt.

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't like that.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't like that.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't like that.

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's why I don't think it's a problem.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh really?

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,500
I don't know.

213
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Even if you say it, it's already over the day before.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ah, it's a troublesome story.

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a troublesome story.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll write it down.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No, it's just that...

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wonder if it's there.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ah, but I don't know, Hamada.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,500
What is it?

223
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,000
If you talk too much about drama.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why?

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's just that Yamazaki is already blue.

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Just now in the dressing room.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
After all, it's going to be a story like that.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How did you get it?

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
How is it?

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There's a little story like that.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll tell you, right?

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is this feeling?

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't get it!

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
In a sense, I'm saying that Yamazaki is the main character.

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What kind of feeling is that?

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not out yet.

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Even if you say it, it's just Yamazaki.

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Everyone else is out.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If you say it as a member of the kids, it's just Yamazaki.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not out yet, so it's okay to have a role.

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's hard.

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm looking at Yamazaki right now.

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's hard.

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's no good if it's this story.

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm looking at it from there.

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's going to be a story like that.

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know what Lee Japan went crazy about.

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It was number one, right?

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It was number one.

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's true.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yamazaki is here again!

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to see it with a face like number 62.

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who is enjoying the thrill of living or dying.

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please tell me the story of how you managed to escape while being attacked by a giant ant hell that drags humans into the Sahara Desert.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This was hard.

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Really?

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What kind of ant hell do you know?

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you know what happens in the end?

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't know that.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't know that at all.

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Really?

263
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let me tell you a little bean knowledge.

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What is it?

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There's something called Nagoya Kochin, right?

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Nagoya Kochin is a famous bird.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Like a chicken.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like a chicken.

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's really stupid.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why?

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you surprise it, it will die.

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Really?

274
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Nagoya Kochin.

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's really hard to raise it.

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't surprise it.

277
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't surprise it.

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If you put it in like this, it will die.

279
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's too much.

280
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's true.

281
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's too much.

282
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You have to feed it gently.

283
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's annoying.

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Such a bird.

285
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're angry, aren't you?

286
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The door will open and bang.

287
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It will die.

288
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It will die.

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why?

290
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't surprise it.

291
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's true.

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like a chicken.

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
A chicken is dead because it can't breathe.

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But Nagoya Kochin is dead when it is held.

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's true.

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It doesn't matter what happens at the end.

297
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's true.

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When it is held, it will die.

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's not true.

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What do you mean?

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's dead.

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What are you talking about?

303
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What are you talking about?

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why does it die?

305
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's surprised.

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a fool.

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Nagoya Kochin.

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's true.

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's really a fool.

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's surprised that the guy next to it died.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's strange.

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When the guy next to it died, I was surprised.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's true.

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's true.

315
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can't raise such a thing.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's true.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a big deal.

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I was talking about when it ran away.

319
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It ran away.

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a big deal.

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We don't know what's going on.

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We don't know.

323
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We don't know.

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've never been addicted to it.

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Is that so?

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Please tell me what happened.

327
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you want me to tell you?

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not over with Nagoya Kochin.

329
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You said it yourself.

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If I didn't say it myself, I wouldn't have died.

331
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Even now, Nagoya Kochin is dying.

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's fine.

333
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I want to hear this now.

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's true.

335
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It ran away.

336
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was addicted to it.

337
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
In Sahara.

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It happened in Sahara Desert.

339
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's right.

340
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Please tell me what happened.

341
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I arrived at the Sahara Airport.

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Not in the desert?

343
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Is the airport like that?

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Sahara International Airport.

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I arrived at the North Wing.

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's a big place.

348
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The Sahara Airport.

349
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
When I got off the plane, it was like this.

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's not true.

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why did you get off at the airport?

352
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a huge place.

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is it in the middle of the desert?

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What is it?

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The airport is in the North Wing.

356
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's in the North.

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is it in the middle of the desert?

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's not standing.

359
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know.

360
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
When you got off, it was like this.

361
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is it in the middle of the desert?

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The airport is like this.

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Is it in the middle of the desert?

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is there an airport in the middle of the desert?

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No.

366
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Listen to me.

367
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's like this.

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What is that?

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's like an ant's hell.

370
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's like a fish bowl.

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

372
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What were you thinking about earlier?

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What's more important?

374
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know.

375
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's like this.

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's like this.

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's like this.

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What are you doing?

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's this?

380
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's like this.

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's like this.

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's getting bigger.

383
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It was this small at first.

384
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's getting bigger.

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's what a big one is.

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's going down.

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's getting bigger.

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Who is this?

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll tell you later.

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There's someone doing it.

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, in the Sahara desert, there's a plane that goes like this, and you think it's easy to land there, right?

392
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And then you go like this.

393
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
At first, it was fine, but when you get into the landing zone, it goes like this.

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Right? It was fine before, but it's bigger than you think.

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You don't know that, so when you say,

396
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm waiting for your arrival with all my heart.

397
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What's that?

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's later.

399
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When you land, it goes like this.

400
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, it's fine. It went like this.

401
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It went like this.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What happened? Only one leg went like this.

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It went like this.

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
At that time, I was wearing pants, so I didn't know what to do.

405
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's called the Sahara.

406
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Sahara?

407
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
When you go to the Sahara, you wear something that's a little different from usual.

408
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
A bell bottom.

409
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was wearing a bell bottom that was more than necessary.

410
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It was fine normally, right?

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's right.

412
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's why it was easy to grab.

413
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who is it now?

414
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Who is it?

415
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This guy.

416
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you want to know who it is?

417
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You want to know that, right? You've been doing it for a long time, haven't you?

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
After all, I can't talk about this without his story.

419
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This is surprising.

420
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Who is it?

421
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is surprising.

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Who is it? What is it?

423
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, how do I say this?

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Simply put, it's a foreigner.

425
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's not Japanese, is it?

426
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's a plus.

427
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not Japanese.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
When you go to the Sahara, you want something that's famous.

429
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a Sahara, right?

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's a Sahara, right? It shouldn't be about Ali Jigoku.

431
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you understand?

432
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I understand.

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's why I vote every time.

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What do you vote for?

435
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The Ali Jigoku role.

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I see.

437
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The guy who was chosen at this time.

438
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There was a time when I was a grandmother or a child.

439
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
By the way, when I was in the Sahara, I was 31 years old.

440
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's about 40 years old.

441
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Even if I was 31 years old, I had a lot of upper arm muscles.

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I had a lot of muscles.

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You were 31 years old.

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I was 31 years old.

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I had a lot of muscles.

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I had a lot of muscles.

447
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I was beaten by that guy.

448
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I was grabbed.

449
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you know what happens when you're dragged in?

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know.

451
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I had to do it with the guy inside.

452
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I had to do it with everyone.

453
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I had to do it with everyone.

454
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There were about 50 people.

455
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I had to do it with everyone.

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I had to do it with everyone.

457
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There were about 50 people.

458
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I had to do it with everyone.

459
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The other day, Mr. Matsumoto went to the department store with a monkey, a dog and a knight.

460
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There are red and blue demons in the demon.

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What's the difference?

462
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is complicated.

463
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Is it complicated?

464
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's complicated.

465
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There are only blue demons.

466
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What do you think is the difference?

467
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The color is different.

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The demon is a demon.

469
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Is that all?

470
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I feel sorry that you don't have knowledge.

471
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please tell me the difference.

472
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What is it?

473
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Please tell me the difference.

474
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Simply put, red is a punch.

475
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you always come with me?

476
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Red and blue.

477
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's difficult to be friends in the world of demons.

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's not good to be with blue people.

479
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Because they are stupid.

480
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I see.

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Why is it not good?

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They are stupid and stupid.

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
On the contrary.

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
On the contrary?

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Red has to be blue.

486
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Red always says a lot of things.

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's a demon's punch.

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Don't laugh at me.

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Red and blue must always be together.

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's not good in the world of demons.

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't even go to the pool.

492
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Pool?

493
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If it's red and blue, it's a split.

494
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There are days when it's red.

495
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
On the contrary, it's blue.

496
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There are days when it's blue.

497
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't think I deserve to be treated like this.

498
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You don't deserve to be treated like this.

499
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I want to say more.

500
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's a stupid punch.

501
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Simply put.

502
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There are many other things.

503
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's a stupid punch, right?

504
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There are many other things.

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The two red horns are different from the one red horn, right?

506
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There is a difference.

507
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, it's different from Japan.

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How is it different?

509
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The two red horns are the same as the one blue horn.

510
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What's the same?

511
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Feelings.

512
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know that.

513
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's why I say it's complicated.

514
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's a stupid punch.

515
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's a stupid punch.

516
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The two red horns are...

517
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I got it. It's complicated.

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I got the difference now.

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You got it, right?

520
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I got it.

521
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I wanted to say more about that.

522
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know that.

523
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We don't know that.

524
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's right.

525
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There's a slight difference between the two horns.

526
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The one that goes like this is a little bit of a joke.

527
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The one that goes like this is red.

528
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But the one that goes like this in blue is something I really hate.

529
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I see.

530
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And the ten-par is not ten-par.

531
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's a little bit.

532
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Ten-par is a little bit of a cheeky joke.

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
A joke that doesn't even laugh when you tickle someone.

534
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's funny.

535
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
With poker face.

536
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's funny.

537
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There's something like that.

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Is that so?

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And the one that doesn't have horns is red.

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There's one that doesn't have horns?

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Really?

542
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.

543
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The one that doesn't have horns is red.

544
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Your...

545
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Your demon talk is basically a play.

546
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
From now on, I'm going to keep messing around.

547
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Is that so?

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm not just going to have red and blue anymore.

549
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What?

550
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What color are you going to have?

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
There's a lot of things.

552
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Red and blue, horns like this, like that, no, ten-par.

553
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm going to marry whoever I want, so I'm messed up.

554
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Is that so?

555
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes.

556
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What color are you going to have?

557
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Recently, I've had paisley.

558
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not scared of that.

559
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Even if a demon with a paisley pattern comes out, I don't think I'll be scared.

560
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You're scared if a demon with a paisley pattern comes out.

561
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll just watch it.

562
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What is this?

563
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's scary.

564
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If a red demon comes out, I'll be scared, but I'll just calm down and watch it.

565
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There's also a lot of woodpeckers.

566
