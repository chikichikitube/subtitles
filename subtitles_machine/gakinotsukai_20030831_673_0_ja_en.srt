00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry to interrupt your work.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In May this year, I gave birth to my eldest daughter.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Children grow up really fast.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today, I'm going on a trip with my friend to Karuizawa.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not that fast, is it?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm Endo Shodo.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000

The other day, when I woke up and sighed,

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't eat anything the night before, but I smelled like poop.

Next, please.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When I went to look for a new house,

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I found Tanaka-san in the middle of the 4th floor.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He was born in the 3rd of the 4th floor.

Next, please.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Anyway, that was a great show.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'd like to join in the fun.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Nice to meet you.

43

This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sure you're all used to this program.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, we are.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to ask you to do a strange program.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to ask you to do a strange program.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to ask you to do a strange program.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to ask you to do a strange program.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
First of all,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is the name of the most effective nutrition drink?

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sure you've heard of it.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This will make you feel better.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's the name of the nutrition drink.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay?

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yama-chan.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not luck.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yukeru...

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Next.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Kokkirin-D.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It doesn't work at all.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Kokkirin-D is good.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Miyasako.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Double Gorilla.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It works.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Kitamex Junior.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's good for children.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's good for children.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's good for children.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, Oto-chan.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Power Giant Pentagon.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a good name.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Power Giant Pentagon.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Makka-Mamushi.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Makka-Mamushi Eijo.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is it a grain?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not a nutrition drink.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not a nutrition drink.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you kidding me?

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, I see.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not kidding.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
To-Ijo.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not a nutrition drink.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Next.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tsuyoshi Nagamachi's hit-and-run.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a good name.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a good name.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go with this.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Nagamachi's hit-and-run.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Kama-chan.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Kamakiri.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a good name.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why are you so relaxed?

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Next.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can take care of me on a sunny day.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I know, but it's not good if you say it.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's an album.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's an album.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I know.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not a single cut.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not a super single.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's an album.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's an album.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Tsutomu.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a good name.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tsutomu.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ryuji.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's Ryuji, too.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Next.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A man with a pure fist.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A man with a pure fist.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you talking in one voice?

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Next.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A stage where I say goodbye.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a lie.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll definitely sing it.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're lying.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can't make a song like that.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nagabuchi will make it.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll definitely make it.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm Nagabuchi.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why are you laughing?

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Drowning, connecting, dancing.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you remember this?

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You make a dance according to the music in two bars.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then you add it and make it yourself.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's it.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
For those of you who got stuck, I prepared this as a punishment game.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What is this?

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What is this?

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a machine.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For those of you who got stuck, you have to go around like this.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Like this.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You have to switch.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
First, Yamachan.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ready.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You guys.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's going on?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This isn't punishment anymore.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You have to do it like this.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't lie.

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just one more time.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's easy.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everyone is noisy.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's go.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ready.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't do that.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's do the right and left together.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why are you doing this?

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't say you don't know.

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Remember it.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's go, Yamachan.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's easy.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What kind of rhythm is that?

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's continue.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't like this.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's do it again.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ready.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Do what you feel like.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ready.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What are you doing?

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hodo.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's really long.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do your best.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's good.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't do it anymore.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No.6 is definitely a loss.

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's hard.

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ready.

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's definitely a loss.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's definitely a loss.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go, Matsumoto.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's scary.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's really scary.

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's really scary.

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's really scary.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's really scary.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's scary.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's a big mistake.

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Who would do something like this?

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm scared.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Here we go.

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
3, 2, 1, go!

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's done!

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's done!

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's done!

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's done!

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's done!

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This is bad.

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is bad.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is bad.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is bad.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's still in.

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's still in.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Here we go.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I like this.

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I like this.

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I like this.

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You're going too far.

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Just once.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just once.

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Just once.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The last one.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's spin it.

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hoto-chan.

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's spin it.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's good, right?

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's good.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's good.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's good.

222
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The last one.

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yama-chan.

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What are you doing?

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No one does this.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're doing something you're not supposed to do.

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're doing something you're not supposed to do.

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're doing something you're not supposed to do.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What are you doing?

230
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't remember anything.

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It was really easy.

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's scary.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What happened?

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No!

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't remember anything.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I totally misunderstood.

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The blade...

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't remember anything.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is Sharni.

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There's no way.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I thought it was Sharni.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, no.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
No.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No.

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
3, 2, 1.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Domo!

247
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
IT'S DOMON!

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
IT'S DOMON!

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That was good.

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That was good.

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's how you do it.

252
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Amazing.

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Okay, one more time!

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll do the same song as before.

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What about you, Junma?

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry, I'll go first.

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's not good.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What kind of woman is that?

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
She's got a strong back.

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're the one who did the double action.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay!

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's start.

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's start with Matsumoto-san.

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hey!

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why?

268
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey!

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why?

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Because I want to end this.

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll do it properly.

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll do it properly.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll do it like this.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's do it again.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You know how to do it, right?

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's do it again.

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's do it again.

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay!

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll do it like this.

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

281
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The pot is...

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Ready!

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's hot.

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll eat the pot ramen.

285
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The pot ramen?

286
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I thought it was a bath.

287
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I thought it was a bath.

288
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I thought it was a bath.

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I thought it was a bath.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yamachan!

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yamachan!

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's a complete failure.

293
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Are you okay?

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Are you okay?

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I didn't know it was like this until last year.

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There's nothing like this yet.

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's okay.

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's okay.

299
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Ready!

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's hot.

301
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll do it like this.

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I did it!

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's more like a story than a dance.

304
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Did you call someone?

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I did.

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I called someone.

307
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I called someone.

308
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I called someone.

309
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I called someone.

310
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I called someone.

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I called someone.

312
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I called someone.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Your father is here.

314
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Next is Matsumoto.

315
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's already me?

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's already me?

317
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's been a while.

318
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's finally been a while.

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's been a while.

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's see how many laps you can do.

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:17,000
1, 2, 3.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why did you take off your pants?

323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why?

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Why did you take off your pants?

325
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know.

326
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There must have been something.

327
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This is a kitchen, right?

328
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why did you take it off?

329
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a kitchen.

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank goodness.

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This is bad.

332
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Even though he took off his pants, he said sorry and took it off again.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He took it off again.

334
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The end.

335
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Thank goodness.

336
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It was dangerous.

337
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Did you take it off?

338
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I took it off and stood up.

339
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I took it off and stood up.

340
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I took it off and came out and said sorry and went in.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Everyone, let's go.

342
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can't count anymore.

343
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:18,000
1, 2, 3.

344
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

345
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He's safe.

346
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is he safe?

347
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No, no.

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It should be me who counts.

349
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't know what's going on because he took off his clothes.

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Who took it off?

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Who is it?

352
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Who took that out?

353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Who took it out?

354
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What?

356
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Who took it out?

357
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But it's that kind of corner, right?

358
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, that's not it.

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's the dance corner!

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's strange now.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Isn't it okay for everyone to do it?

362
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No, no, no. I don't know if I made a mistake.

363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't feel like I made a mistake.

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What do you think, everyone?

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's Komiya-san, right?

366
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No, it's not.

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's Komiya-san.

368
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Excuse me for a moment.

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
3, 2, 1, go!

371
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
This kind of set is no good.

372
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's really stuck.

373
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All the staff are going to hit me.

374
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's full of blood.

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
3, 2, 1, go!

376
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
