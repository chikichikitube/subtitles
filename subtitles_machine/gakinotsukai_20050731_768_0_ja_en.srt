00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Last week, during a fake comedy show, Hamada was attacked by an unidentified person.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The two-shot footballer, Minoeva, and his five friends were killed.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's my fault!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Who are you?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Hamada's

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The two-shot footballer, Minoeva, and his five friends were killed.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The recording was stopped, and everyone was left in the corner.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But...

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think I won.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Really?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The double-edged sword Kobori is attacking himself, saying he might have kicked Hamada.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He shows no sign of depression.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And Kobori is alone, in fear, he goes to Hamada's dressing room.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you lick it, it's bitter.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you lick it, it's bitter.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you lick it, it's scary.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Stop it.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you angry?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not angry.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you're not angry, why are you hitting me like that?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Next, the footballer, Iwao, also goes to Hamada's dressing room.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you lick it, it's a half.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you lick it, it's a half.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a lie.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a lie.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hamada went to the three people who were left in the dressing room.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not a thief!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not a thief!

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're a thief!

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you lick me, I'll be red.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you lick me, I'll be red.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The prank was a huge success.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But this is not the end.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Everyone, we have finished the first part.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now everyone will be the main character.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now, the two karate guys will come.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And this time, Masamasa will be the main character.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Everyone, please act properly.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll help you.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This scary prank will be done by Matsumoto.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Young Lady Prank, Karateka!

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Karate guy appears without knowing anything.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And now he meets with other young people who are watching the show.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He joins the show with the license of Yamasaki and Kokoriko.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
After this, he shows the show full of impact in the dressing room.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Dave Spector is also ready.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OK.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Finally, the real show of the fake comparison.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, we will start the special tag match of the 2005 comedy competition.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:42,020
abercrack the underdog Kurt Niffs

53
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,020
Ha Ha Ha Poise!!

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,020
next we have the coming golden boy called Young Generation's

55
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,000
Hahahaha

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,400
ã‚»ãƒ³ã‚»ãƒ¼ cursed

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:26,400
The judge of this game is the lip gorilla of the referee world, Banten Hamada!

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Yeah!

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
How about you, Iwami?

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Now, my turn!

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Here we go!

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
I can't lose!

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Yo yo yo yo yo!

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I'm the champion!

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm going to eat you!

67
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm going to eat you!

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Let's start the game.

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Now, both teams will be given a bouquet.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Here you go.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Fight with pride, teacher!

72
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Stop it!

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Stop it!

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Stop it!

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
You can't do anything here!

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Who is it?

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Who is it?

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't make a scene here!

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
You...

80
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Sorry, sorry.

81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Hey, Suwako.

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Excuse me.

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I don't understand.

85
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Please go to the dressing room.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I'll talk to you later.

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
It's so hot in here.

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Let's go back to the dressing room.

89
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,400
Thank you.

90
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
The first two people were in a weird mood because of the heat.

91
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
They were like, oh, we've done this.

92
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
It was a bit hot.

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
This isn't a prank, it's probably a prank.

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I think so.

95
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Meanwhile, the young people are going back to the dressing room.

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Karateka, who suddenly froze up, is already completely naked.

97
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm so happy.

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm so happy that I brought my flowers.

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
It's like a solo concert.

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
At first, it wasn't funny.

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
But it started and it became even more funny.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,400
I think it was a beautiful feeling.

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
From the beginning.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I don't think it's a good idea to say that you didn't go to the first meeting.

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I think it's like a place where you don't know who you are.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Can I go in?

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm not going to be able to go in.

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
No, no, no.

109
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm sorry, but...

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm sorry, but...

111
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Wow, this is tough.

112
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Only the two of them are running.

113
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
They're sitting down.

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
These guys are totally out of it.

115
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
You guys are not standing here.

116
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I wonder if this is really cut.

117
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
You should have done it properly.

119
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
This is effective.

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I thought it was a unicorn.

121
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
What are you doing?

122
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm interested in the flowers.

123
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,400
This one is like a flower.

124
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
All of us are like this.

125
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
That's right.

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm leaning on Kouji-san's back.

127
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Kouji-san is leaning on me.

128
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
It's better to go.

129
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Yamasaki and Kokoriko head to the youth room.

130
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,400
And they are going to chase after the target, Karate-ka.

131
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
What did you want to do at the door-to-home?

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I went first and then everyone else went and I was told to go to the mic.

133
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
EI?

134
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
It was a performance.

135
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Then Hama-san said,

136
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I went to the Hanataka Sotei.

137
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I didn't say anything.

138
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I didn't say anything.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I didn't say anything.

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I didn't say anything.

141
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Who kicked me with a stick?

142
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Wow, this is strong.

143
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Who kicked me with a stick?

144
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I can't hear the sound of a person.

145
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Someone pushed me and my knee was in.

146
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Knee?

147
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
My knee was pushed.

148
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Pushed?

149
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Yes, pushed.

150
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I don't know who it is.

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I don't know who it is.

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Maybe.

153
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Maybe.

154
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Hamada went to the hospital and he said,

155
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I shouldn't have licked it.

156
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I don't know what to say.

157
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I heard it earlier.

158
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I think it's a bit too much.

159
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I think it's a bit too much.

160
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
He said that it was a tiger.

161
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
He said that it was a tiger.

162
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,400
This is the last chance to surprise Matsumoto.

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Meanwhile, Hamada heads to Wakadestache's room.

164
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
What will be the fate of Karateka?

165
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
What's going on?

166
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
What do you mean, I don't know.

167
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm talking.

168
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm angry, but I don't know what's going on.

169
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I think it's a molly.

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,400
What do you mean?

171
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I don't know.

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Did you do something?

173
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,400
It's probably a self-introduction of the tiger.

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I think it's called,

175
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
What?

176
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Ah yes, oh yes, I'm Irie.

177
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Ah yes, oh yes, I'm Irie.

178
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm Irie.

179
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
The one who introduced the Japanese language was the tiger.

180
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Ah, is that so?

181
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
It's called Irie.

182
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
It's a word for Irie.

183
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Ah, is that so?

184
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
The tiger was quite cute.

185
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I don't know if I lick it.

186
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
The tiger is cute.

187
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
How did you put the tiger's face?

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I was wearing a mask.

189
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I was wearing a mask.

190
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
It was me.

191
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Oh, you guys?

192
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Yes.

193
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
You guys are different.

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Yes, it was me.

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Which one of you hit him?

196
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I hit him.

197
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Oh, it was you.

198
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Someone was holding him.

199
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Oh, really?

200
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Yes.

201
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Who was holding him?

202
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I don't know.

203
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Is there anyone in here?

204
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
You?

205
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I didn't push it.

206
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I was just looking at it thinking it would be better if I didn't push it.

207
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Someone pushed it, right?

208
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Yes.

209
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Who pushed it?

210
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
You?

211
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
What's wrong?

212
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I just saw it.

213
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't know.

214
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
I was saying it earlier.

215
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Yes.

216
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Chan.

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Yes.

218
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
What's wrong with me?

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
It's okay.

220
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
It means you hit me.

221
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Yes.

222
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
It means you hit me.

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Come here.

224
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Come here.

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
So, this is the situation.

226
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
It's not a problem.

227
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Come here.

228
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I went with you.

229
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Please shake hands.

230
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Excuse me.

231
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Thank you.

232
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
See you.

233
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Will this go into the recording?

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,400
No more spinblade

235
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Conf Intense

236
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,400
reveals his true self

237
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,900
If I lick it, I'm wifi

238
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm scared of the

239
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,260
long hair

240
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,900
I'm scared of the long hair

241
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Yabu-chan

242
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Yabu-chan

243
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Yabu-chan

244
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Yabu-chan

245
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Eh?

246
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Abe-san...

247
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Abe-chan, don't say that.

248
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
It's a prank.

249
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
It's a prank.

250
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
A prank.

251
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
A prank.

252
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Everyone but you knew?

253
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Everyone knew?

254
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Even Genju-san?

255
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Yes.

256
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
That's right.

257
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Wow!

258
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm really scared. I thought we were going to break up.

259
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Let's go to the other room.

260
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
There's no difference.

261
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Meanwhile, the other party's Irie is nervous and speechless.

262
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,900
The next day, Matsumoto was...

263
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,900
I'm going to kill you!

264
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm going to kill you!

265
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
You!

266
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
You!

267
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Don't lick me!

268
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Don't lick me!

269
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
I'm done with the first one.

270
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
I'm scared.

271
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
What's wrong?

272
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Don't be angry.

273
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
I was so scared!

274
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
What should I do?

275
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
It's here!

276
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
I was like, what is this?

277
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
I didn't know anything and I was so excited!

278
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Who was it again?

279
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Aoi!

280
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Next time on Gajiro Tsukai Arai, Chikishiki's summer holiday Yamachan presents, Go! Shiodome Jambari!

282
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
This time, there is a word to describe this Shiodome.

283
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Ready, set, go!

284
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
Utaka!

285
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Uchaka is a word that is used in Shiodome.

286
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Makiwara-san is making a song called Uchaka.

287
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,900
Maki?

288
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Maki.

289
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Oh, Maki.

290
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Can you play it for us?

291
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Uchaka.

292
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Yes.

293
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
Amazing.

294
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Uchaka.

295
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Really?

296
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Yes.

297
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
You didn't do the dance.

298
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
It's impossible.

299
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
It's sudden, right?

300
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
I should have done it in advance.

301
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I was a bit irritated by the staff.

302
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
Yamazaki, you're embarrassing me!

303
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Go! Shiodome Jamboree Unchaka is held in Tokyo Shiodome until August 31st.

305
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Starting with the special booth of the popular TV show, special events are held.

306
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,900
And the first member to visit is...

307
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
What do you call this?

308
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
It's cute.

309
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm not happy.

310
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Happy Zubi.

311
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Happy Zubi.

312
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Are you okay?

313
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
I'm okay.

314
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
I don't remember anything.

315
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,900
And I have the contents of Happy Zubi.

316
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Last year, I was in the end.

317
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
I was in the end.

318
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,900
I was in the end last year, so I'll be in the end this year again.

319
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll do it.

320
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
It's fine.

321
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Is it funny?

322
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
It's fine.

323
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
I want to see the senior's mountain climbing.

324
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Do you enter from here?

325
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Yes, I enter from here.

326
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Be more excited than usual!

327
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Yes.

328
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Do you know the rhythm of Samba?

329
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Do it seriously.

330
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Do it, Shinkoku!

331
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Here I go!

332
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,900
1, 2, 3!

333
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Shinkoku, Shinkoku!

334
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Ah, it's so cold.

335
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,900
It's bad for the end but you couldn't look directly.

336
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
I'm going to hate you, Chan.

337
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Ichiro walks around the venue and goes to the next booth.

338
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
What's this?

339
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:32,100
This is Fuji-Q Highland's

340
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
There's nothing!

341
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
This is scary!

342
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
There's nothing left!

343
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
There's nothing left!

344
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Nothing!

345
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Got it!

346
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Senbos!

347
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
No!

348
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
You're too fast!

349
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I'll be in the background!

350
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
No!

351
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
You'll be in the background!

352
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm not a ghost.

353
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Are you okay, Eiko?

354
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm not a ghost.

355
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
You're a ghost.

356
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm not a ghost.

357
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Here he is.

358
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
No, no, no.

359
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
He's not here.

360
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
He's not here.

361
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Let's get out of here.

362
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
I want you to sit here.

363
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
No, no, no.

364
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Eiko, Eiko.

365
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Please let me go.

366
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Let me out!

367
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
What?

368
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

369
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Here! Here!

370
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Excuse me.

371
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
This is the director.

372
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
General director.

373
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
General director.

374
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
That's a big deal.

375
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Here we are!

376
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
The hot spring inn?

377
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Yes, the hot spring inn with the Uwagawa hot spring.

378
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,100
We've set up a booth here.

379
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Let's go!

380
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Look!

381
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Wow!

382
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
It's nostalgic!

383
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
We've been on that before.

384
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Did you bring that with you?

385
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Hello everyone!

386
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,600
Hello!

387
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,600
From here, tour guide will guide you.

388
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
The first person to greet you is...

389
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,100
Hello everyone, welcome.

390
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,100
This is Hamada in downtown, and Tanaka in Kokoriko.

391
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,600
And there's one more person, a guy called Yamana, who's made a joke out of him.

392
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,100
That legendary hot spring.

393
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I don't think a country bumpkin like you can go on without laughing till the end.

394
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
You're terrible.

395
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
I'll do my best.

396
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Of course, the end of the year special was a laughable one.

397
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,100
If you laugh, you'll be given a penalty and if you don't, you'll be forced to leave.

398
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
What's that?

399
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
This is a bit of a concern, right?

400
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Yes.

401
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Well, please.

402
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
This is...

403
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
I just laughed.

404
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Because the camera is going to go bang!

405
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
What's that?

406
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
What's that?

407
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I'm sorry, Mr. Homma.

408
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Yes.

409
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,100
It's real.

410
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
It's real, isn't it?

411
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Does it mean that you can meet it sometimes?

412
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
It means that you can meet it sometimes.

413
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
I see.

414
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
It means that it can be used that much.

415
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
This is the bath.

416
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Please take a seat over there.

417
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Mr. Edo, please.

418
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Mr. Tanaka, please sit here.

419
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
There's nothing to be afraid of.

420
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Huh? You laughed.

421
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
What do you mean by that?

422
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It's not a joke.

423
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
It's not a joke.

424
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
It's not a joke.

425
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
It's not a joke.

426
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
It's not a joke.

427
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
It's not a joke.

428
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
The school trip is over.

429
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
And the next day...

430
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Everyone, come here.

431
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Gakitsuka 5 is...

432
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,100
These 5 are Gakitsuka 5 members.

433
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,100
If you buy this DVD, you can get a Promoide of Gakitsuka 5.

434
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Hamada-san, you can have one.

435
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Thank you.

436
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Only one of Nakamura's boots is in the Heipo.

437
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I don't care if this one is wrong or right.

438
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
This is rare.

439
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
I think,

440
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Nittel Jamboree,

441
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I think it would be better to leave a trash can where the boots came out.

442
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Gakitsuka Boots is on sale during this period.

443
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
It's a good time to enjoy the show.

444
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,100
