1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first episode of the Gaggenau Skyar episode!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The 24 hour round interview!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We've done it with Jimmy-chan too.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, what was the name of this?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was the first time with Yamami-san, right?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, we did it with Jimmy-san.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And with Suzuki-san.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, yes.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Earlier, the main character of today, the camera was coming this way, so I told him to move.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And he had this kind of face.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes, he was like this.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry but I'm a bit scared.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I have to call them.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've already booked them.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's go.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today's star is Nadal!

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello!

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please stop being so close.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, no.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're going to be like that.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, no. You're a weirdo.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Weirdo?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I was really worried about what you said on the show.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I feel like I'm going to wait in front of my house after I get rich.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Like a door to a yakuza.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't say that.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Scary, scary.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you okay?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you think of me as your senior?

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I think of you as my senior.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I respect you.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I want to be like you.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to change.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then, please apologize to the downtown on Wednesday.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is bad.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The 4th year of the group, the Chikichiki Peppers have conquered the King of Contest.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But, if you ask if they are currently in a great success, they are not.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There is a problem with Nadal in the first episode.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
To find out the truth, Nadal's true face will be revealed in a long interview.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
On the day of the interview, the sky was blessed.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The hotel in Shiodome, Tokyo.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nadal will be naked for 24 hours in a day.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But...

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
After the scheduled time, Nadal came.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nadal, you're so sudden.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In the end, he came an hour later.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So sudden?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're really something.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He was late, and he was at the scene of the drama.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're late for the show.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm just a little late.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're late.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The rain...

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The rain...

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not kidding.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know how it's going to be.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't take it anymore.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I've been waiting since 9am.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Right?

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The interview is based on this year's report.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He will talk about his life and future.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm really happy.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,500
It's a chance to get to know myself by saying 24 hours.

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I'm looking forward to it.

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Your face is like...

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Today, we will ask you everything.

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please answer honestly and without lying.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,500
I will tell you everything that I have been told.

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

74
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
The 24-hour curtain that Nadal talks about openly has opened.

75
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,500
What was it like to be born as Nadal?

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I was told that I was cute

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Like a baby?

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Yes, like I don't want to be seen

79
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
In 1984, Nadal was born as the eldest son of three siblings

80
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh, Nadal!

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
What is your real name?

82
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
My real name?

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Well, I have a reason to do it.

84
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
What is it?

85
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I'm doing it in Nadal, so I have a reason to do it.

86
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I think it's a bad idea to do it in Nadal.

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
I think it's okay.

88
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
I don't know how many times I've done it.

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm doing it in Nadal as a comedian.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Can I ask you a question?

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Sure.

92
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
What is your name?

93
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
My real name is Aiu-ra Hideki.

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Aiu-ra Hideki?

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
That's a pretty unique name.

96
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
That's right.

97
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
It's a common name.

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I heard that I was the vassal of the Uesugi family of the Uesugi family.

99
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Really?

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,500
The ancestors of the Aiu-ra family are the vassals who served the great name of the Sengoku family, the Uesugi family.

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Really?

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
My dad told me that.

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Really?

104
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I don't think so.

105
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I don't know if he really said that.

106
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
But I heard that he said that in the lyrics.

107
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't need to doubt him anymore.

108
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
He was originally from a military family.

109
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
He was a soldier, but he was a soldier.

110
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
He was a farmer.

111
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
What is that?

112
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
His family is from Minami-Yamashiro village, the only village in Kyoto.

113
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,500
It's a small village with a population of about 2800 people.

114
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Minami-Yamashiro village.

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
The new town in this village.

116
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
New town?

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
It's developing in this village.

118
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
It's a new residential area.

119
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
What is new town?

120
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,900
In Minamiyama Shirobura, there are various districts.

121
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,900
There are Dosenbo, Tayama, and Takao.

122
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,400
There is a place called New Town.

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Is New Town a famous place?

124
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,900
Everyone calls it that.

125
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,500
It's not a famous place.

126
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
It's not a famous place.

127
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,300
Please do it.

128
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,100
Since he was young, he has been a scary father to Nadar.

129
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,300
His name is Seichiro.

130
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,100
He looks like his father.

131
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,900
Father, do you have any memories of the first episode?

132
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
Can I say it now?

133
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,300
But when I was born, my penis was pulled out.

134
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,600
When I was ready to do something, I used to wash my penis with soap.

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I had no feelings.

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,100
But when I looked around, I saw that my penis was not washed properly.

137
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
I thought I could wash it by pulling out my penis.

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
I said, it hurts!

139
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I thought, oh!

140
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,100
I was pulled out when I didn't feel pain.

141
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Don't make a self-reflection!

142
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
If this male child is born,

143
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,100
When I was born, I wanted to wash my eyes clean.

144
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Speaking of your father, there is a TV show about something and a topic called Inaba no Monoki.

145
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Naderu, whose father Seichiro collects something and keeps it in his storage, is teased on TV every now and then, but he never tries to break his mouth.

146
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
What's in that?

147
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
I said it's impossible.

148
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
It's impossible.

149
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
I said it's impossible.

150
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I said it's impossible.

151
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
It's scary.

152
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
I have to interview.

153
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Why are you so beautiful?

154
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
I have to interview.

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Do you know what's in it?

156
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Of course I know.

157
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Why?

158
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
It's a promise.

159
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
I don't know why I'm wearing this.

160
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I'm scared.

161
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
But now it's like that.

162
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
If you can stop the camera.

163
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
The people behind the camera are like new.

164
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
They're like, don't do it.

165
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
The people behind the camera are like new.

166
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Since he became a man of his word, he has always liked living things.

167
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,100
He was attracted to the turtle that was raised in the pond and decided to go to a nursery.

168
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:10,100
At that time, in the nursery, did you feel uncomfortable about the environment?

169
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:24,100
I was so stupid that I was crying when I found out that there was a rule.

170
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,100
I didn't know what the rule was.

171
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,100
I didn't know there was a sound.

172
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

173
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,100
I don't know what I'm saying.

174
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I have to do something.

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
I'm crying all the time.

176
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,100
He was a child who was running away from difficult things.

177
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,100
When he was in elementary school, he became bright about other problems.

178
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm a little tired.

179
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Did you get good grades in elementary school?

180
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,100
I think it was better.

181
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I think I became more intelligent from the 5th grade.

182
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,100
I didn't feel calm until the 4th grade.

183
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I ran around during my break time.

184
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
I ran naked when I noticed.

185
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
You ran alone?

186
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
I said, wow!

187
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
You were cute like that.

188
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I said, wow!

189
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
I climbed the highest part of the hill.

190
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,100
I was a little bit nervous, but I was able to get up and help my grandmother.

191
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,100
I felt that my life was not normal since I was in elementary school.

192
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm annoyed.

193
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,100
I was a college student when I started teaching comedians.

194
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I didn't know anything about comedians.

195
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Did you watch any new comedians?

196
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,100
I didn't have a chance to watch them.

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,600
Did your father stop you?

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Yes, my father.

199
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,100
Why did he tell you not to watch it?

200
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
Because I would become a fool.

201
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,100
He spent his childhood with no interest in comedy.

202
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,600
He eventually became a teenager who was aware of his opposite sex.

203
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I hardly talked to girls in middle school.

204
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
You didn't realize it?

205
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I was simply rejected by all the girls.

206
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,100
What are you talking about?

207
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I raised my hand during class and the teacher said to lower your hand.

208
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
I raised my hand and the teacher said,

209
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
You know what I mean, right?

210
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
You don't even have to raise your hand.

211
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
I was disappointed.

212
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
I was disappointed when I was wrong.

213
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Why did you raise your hand?

214
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I went to the toilet and there were no shoes.

215
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
I was a real Izumi.

216
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
The reason was a test soon after the entrance of the school.

217
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,100
The seat in front of the hallway is mine.

218
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I said, let's start the test.

219
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,100
When I said, let's start, a girl said, wait a minute, teacher.

220
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Even though the chime is ringing, a female student who came to the classroom late.

221
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Yesterday I said, I'm not studying at all.

222
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,600
I said, no, no, no.

223
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I said, Chaimu, you shouldn't be in the class.

224
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You're the one studying, right?

225
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
She said, yeah, but I'm sleeping.

226
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,100
She was acting like she was having fun.

227
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
I got angry.

228
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,600
Everyone was waiting.

229
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,100
So I said,

230
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,100
You, stop it.

231
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,100
You, everyone's waiting for you.

232
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,100
You, you're the one studying, right?

233
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,100
I don't know if you're doing this because you think it's funny, but you should quit studying and go to school.

234
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I said that a lot.

235
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Then, the girl suddenly grabbed the textbook and hit it on the hallway.

236
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,100
She looked at me and said,

237
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,100
I was going to go to school now.

238
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
I thought it was my fault.

239
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I was nervous and I was testing myself.

240
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
But I started to be bullied from the next day.

241
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
I was the leader.

242
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,100
The 100-day competition was really hard.

243
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,100
There was a 100-day competition after the winter break.

244
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,100
If I could win the competition, something might change in this.

245
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I remember 100 people round very well.

246
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,100
And the 100 people round competition started.

247
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I was so excited.

248
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,100
I was the first one.

249
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
I was so excited.

250
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I was like, what the hell?

251
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,100
The moment I took the picture, the girl touched my hand.

252
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
I took the picture first.

253
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,100
The girl said, no!

254
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,100
The gym was full of people.

255
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
No!

256
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
They were all going crazy.

257
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
There were three teachers.

258
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,100
What did you do?

259
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I said I didn't do anything.

260
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I've been doing this for 100 days.

261
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I don't think I can do anything.

262
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I said I didn't do anything.

263
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Why did this happen?

264
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
I didn't do anything.

265
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,100
As I was talking, I realized that the woman touched me.

266
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,100
I said I didn't do anything.

267
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
It started again.

268
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
There was another woman.

269
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,100
He was looking at me, and he was looking at me.

270
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
He said, I'll wash you after I get out of the soap.

271
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,100
I was like, what?

272
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,100
I couldn't say anything.

273
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
I was so angry.

274
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
You were so angry.

275
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,100
I was so angry.

276
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm glad I was able to enter.

277
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
It's so hot that I might get caught.

278
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
That's terrible.

279
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
3 and a half hours have passed since the start.

280
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
With the hope of being able to continue, they head to the next stop, which is their hobby.

281
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
A hobby?

282
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Of course, while they're on the move, the interview continues.

283
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
The weather is...

284
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
How do you refresh yourself in your room?

285
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Not outside.

286
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,100
I put my face on the pillow.

287
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,100
I'm tired.

288
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
It's been 2 or 3 hours.

289
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
What do you want to do after 2 or 3 hours?

290
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
I might be sleeping.

292
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
You are sleeping.

293
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,100
He has a hobby of fishing.

294
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,100
He is a real man.

295
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Wow, that's amazing.

296
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Thank you.

297
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
It's perfect.

298
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Yes, it's all in here.

299
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Here, we hear stories from his university days.

300
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
After graduating from high school,

301
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
he wanted to work in the fish farm,

302
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,100
and other related jobs related to fishery.

303
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,100
He decided to study fishery at the university.

304
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Were you interested in comedy at that time?

305
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I got interested in it when I was in college.

306
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,100
That's why I started it.

307
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,100
The first time I watched it, it was an all-darts comic.

308
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
But the giraffe comic was so funny.

309
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I thought, there are so many interesting people.

310
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,100
At that time, did you want to be a comedian?

311
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
This is not good.

312
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,100
He is always in the mood and asks many questions.

313
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
You're so mean!

314
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
At least if you can catch fish, you can draw pictures.

315
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
You like it, don't you?

316
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Even after 2 hours, he can't catch anything.

317
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
You can't catch anything, can you?

318
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Well, I can't catch anything during the day.

319
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Was it better at night?

320
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Yes, I think I was better at night.

321
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,100
If you want to be a night person, then you should be a night person.

322
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,100
I want to calm my back and do an interview.

323
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Looking at Kirin's comic, the university era began to be interested in comedians.

324
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I wanted to go to the Department of Fisheries, especially the aquarium.

325
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,100
I wanted to be a comedian, but I didn't have enough money.

326
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,100
So I started to work as a waiter.

327
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
You were a waiter?

328
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
I worked as a waiter in the kitchen.

329
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,100
He spent his days in a daze because of his job.

330
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
But when he was 25, he suddenly found a way to be a comedian.

331
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I didn't know that.

332
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,100
We were all in the same class, and we were going to go out for a drink and then go home.

333
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,100
One of my friends told me,

334
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
I want you to try acting as an entertainer.

335
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
He was my friend from college.

336
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,100
If you don't want to do it, you can try it.

337
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
You can do anything if you want to get a job.

338
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Just try it once.

339
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,100
That's how I started.

340
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Why did you start acting as a comedian?

341
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I don't know why, but I was told it was fun.

342
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,100
It's important, so please tell us more.

343
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:46,100
I had a friend who had a ostrich.

344
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
I went to get the ostrich eggs.

345
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,100
They said, please get the ostrich eggs.

346
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I said OK.

347
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
There were about 20 ostriches in the cage.

348
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
All the ostriches followed me.

349
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
No matter how much I tried to get them,

350
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,100
they all followed me even though it was night.

351
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
I couldn't get the eggs.

352
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
That's how it was.

353
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:22,100
As far as I know, he was 25 years old and entered Osaka NSC with a very comfortable feeling.

354
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Of course, he was not so sweet as a comedian.

355
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,100
In 2010, he entered Osaka NSC at the age of 25.

356
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,100
I knew that there were many interesting people when I entered Osaka NSC.

357
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,100
I wanted to do the opening ceremony.

358
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I thought that it was not so funny if it was the opening ceremony.

359
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
This is a terrible thing to say.

360
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
I was talking to Mr. Ueda of Cream Chou.

361
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
This is bad.

362
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
This is a good thing.

363
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,100
I was doing the opening ceremony when I just started to enter the entertainment industry.

364
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,100
I had a car, so I put a prop on it.

365
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
I went to Hoshimi.

366
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Is that what you call a break?

367
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
That is also a break.

368
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,100
After learning various break and laughter, Nadal gradually gained strength.

369
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,100
In 2012, he formed Korochiki Peppers with his 7 year old classmate Nishino.

370
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Nadal talked about the making of the story of Korochiki in an interview in the daytime.

371
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm doing half and half for the story.

372
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
We fight and fight and fight.

373
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,100
There are times when it's hard, but something is connected.

374
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
It's hard to do that much story.

375
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
I can't do it alone.

376
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,100
The two of them are struggling to make a good story.

377
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:58,100
In just four years of formation, they conquered the King of Contest and broke it at once.

378
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
I was really happy

379
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:07,100
The next year, he moved to Tokyo and continued his activities

380
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,100
But Nadal is still not satisfied

381
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I don't think I can be satisfied with my current state

382
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I can't laugh

383
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,100
You have to think about your laughter all the time

384
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I heard that Matsumoto-san went somewhere and said that he was still in the second round.

385
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Are you thinking about it?

386
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,100
I thought about it and I didn't think about it.

387
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
What are you talking about?

388
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
I think that Matsumoto-san should go through this.

389
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,100
You're proud of that?

390
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I think that he should run on the same path.

391
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
I think about the kind of laughter I can get.

392
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
What kind of laughter do you want to hear?

393
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I think about that.

394
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
At the beginning, the entrance was very wide. There were many kinds of laughter.

395
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,100
I made a lot of mistakes.

396
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,100
I was making a lot of mistakes.

397
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
That's why I'm in the DL.

398
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
I was caught in such a moment.

399
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
It's scary.

400
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
It's that difficult.

401
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
It's scary.

402
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,100
The interview is still less than half an hour.

403
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,100
The first time the show started, he lost his energy and his expression is still the same.

404
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
What are you doing?

405
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,100
The 24 hour long interview will be broadcasted on the second half of Zaiharan.

406
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
I'm not sure if I can do it.

407
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,100
And the one who followed Ueda's down.

408
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
I think that's a bit far.

409
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
It's really weird.

410
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I've been cut off somewhere.

411
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,100
There was a part where I could do it even if it wasn't funny.

412
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,100
There's a Ueda-san from the cream shop.

413
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,100
In the meantime, there was a very rich story.

414
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
I'm not sure if I can do it.

415
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,100
To check, when I look back on the vtr.

416
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,600
I don't think it's that funny if it's just Shikiri

417
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
If you say Shikiri...

418
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,600
Well, Ueda-san from Cream Chou

419
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,600
He didn't edit at all

420
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,100
But Nadal's life continues

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,100
So, Shikiri can be funny

422
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,600
But there's a ridiculous Shikiri, Ueda-san

423
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
It doesn't have to be funny

424
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,600
As long as there's poop

425
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
No, no, no

426
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
No, no, no

427
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,100
It's not funny yet

428
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Wait a minute!

429
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
I'm sorry!

430
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
I didn't say anything that was good enough to explain!

431
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,100
The 24 hour long interview is over!

432
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,100
The alcohol is in, and Nadal is attacked by the water horse.

433
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
This is tough.

434
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Eh, it's red!

435
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
It's dripping from the front!

436
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Nadal-san?

437
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Will he be able to do the 24 hour long interview?

438
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Oke, Nap time.
