1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
As always, thank you very much.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,500
I received a rose that I hated in the hospital room.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
It was a little annoying.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I received the rose! Thank you very much.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Huh?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm the master of the house, so I'm the AD Otomo!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello!

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What's wrong?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Um...

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No one woke me up!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was sleeping and I saw a bear under my eyes.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I had to fool him, so I made a bear in the middle of the night.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You fooled him?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's fine. We'll talk about that later.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Today's opening is...

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's the AD Otomo battle.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is the first time!

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Actually, we have an AD Otomo in our staff.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He has a lot of letters.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
First of all, this is...

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
By the way, I don't have a boyfriend, so I can't sleep well.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'd be happy if someone could introduce him to me.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I have a suggestion.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why don't we have an AD Otomo battle for the first time?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I see.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We've got four of them.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, really?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We've got four of them.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, really?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
First of all, the four people who wrote this letter, come on out!

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These are the people who said they liked Otomo.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's your name?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm Yuki Naito, 23 years old.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's your name?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm Keiko Serita, 18 years old.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm Michiko Sakai, 24 years old.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm Naoko Nishikawa, 18 years old.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're all so quiet.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're all so quiet.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Who are these people?

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Who are these people?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, if you want Otomo, come on out.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And ask Otomo a lot of questions.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sure some of you haven't seen Otomo yet.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I wonder what it's like to be called an old man by four women.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
For now, we're the ED Otomo lotto.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This program is brought to you by the 4th and the sponsor of this program.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will ask you 4 questions from now on. Please answer them correctly.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are you number 1?

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think I am.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Number 1?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are number 4, right?

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, I am.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's easy to understand. Number 1, number 4, number 2, number 3.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's complicated.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's easy to answer with 1, 2, 3, 4.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's interesting.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't say that.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want you to answer honestly.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want you to say it again.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When was your first experience?

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
With whom? How?

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you asking me to tell you the answer?

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you saying yes?

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When I was 18 years old, I was with my girlfriend.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You were dating at that time.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not like that.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's true.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's true.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's true.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's true.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's true.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It was 7 years ago.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You were dating at that time.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Say it again.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You were dating at that time.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You were dating at home.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is that the first time?

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes, it's the first time.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I see.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Did you two get along well at first?

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, we failed at first.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was like that, too.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You didn't listen to me.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It hurts.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't take it anymore.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can't take it anymore.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I went to the hotel next door.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you kidding me?

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Is it true that you are living together?

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I often go to my friend's house.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We live together.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I see.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You go to your friend's house.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You don't live together.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You lied to me.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I was on the phone while editing.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You were on the phone while editing.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you on the phone?

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was on the phone while editing.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I was on the phone while editing.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You were on the phone while editing.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's take a picture.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
One by one.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's about 30 seconds, right?

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hello.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One by one.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where are you from?

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm from Japan.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Continue.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Continue.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you ever come to watch our program?

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Not once.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Not once?

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm a high school student.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you watch it every week?

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How old are you?

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
24 years old.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
24 years old.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
24 years old is your age.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was surprised.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's funny.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was frustrated.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Shut up.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hello.

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hello.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Have you ever seen me before?

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What?

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Have you ever seen me before?

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I saw you on TV.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
On TV?

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Your baseball is amazing.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your baseball technique.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My technique?

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Your batting was amazing.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I did it on purpose.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It was cool.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Really?

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're lying.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have the time to fool around.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's why I called you.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Please open the chair.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It doesn't matter what you say or hear.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please put on the eye mask.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay?

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I asked you a question.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And you talked to each other.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He is in front of you.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He is different from you.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you think so, please go home.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay?

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Please come closer.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Here.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't fall.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Please judge.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What will they do?

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There is one person left.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There is one person left.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to be with Otomo.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There is one person left.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Otomo, please take off the eye mask.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is this?

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hello.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hello.

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's do our best.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hello.

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hello.

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What is this?

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why did you suddenly pay 2,000 yen?

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's the same amount as before.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't want to talk about this.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I can't ignore it.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What?

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's something to celebrate.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's black.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Thank you very much.

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you very much.

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you very much.

198
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you very much.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you very much.

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you very much.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you very much.

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I will collect 1,000 yen each from here.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why?

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have known him for a long time.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't believe that he has a child.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why?

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
When I go back to my hometown, all my friends are like that.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When I go back to my hometown, all my friends are like that.

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why don't you say that?

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have a lot to say.

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are amazing.

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank you very much.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Thank you very much.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are amazing.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you very much.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You are amazing.

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's talk about the program.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's talk about the program.

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Did you see the program?

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Did you see the program?

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I saw the program until the last minute.

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are cold.

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are cold.

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I saw the program until the last minute.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am scared.

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you scared of?

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are scary.

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What?

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are scary.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You have blood.

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You are scary when you see blood.

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I saw the program until the last minute.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I heard that you cut the grass here.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have been cutting grass for a long time.

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can't cut grass.

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can't cut grass.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can't cut grass.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, no, no.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't cut grass.

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So I do not cut grass.

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have to cut grass.

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If I cut grass, I will have a lot of grass.

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I do not cut grass.

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So I cut grass.

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If I cut it, it will be like an egg.

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If you cut, it will be like an egg.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you do not cut, it will be like an egg.

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you cut, it will be like an egg.

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You have to do it well.

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If you do not cut, it will be like an egg.

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The grass will not be too thick.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I want you to see my face.

255
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why?

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Which side is the face when it comes out from the head?

257
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Huh?

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Which side is the face when it comes out from the head?

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's facing this way, right?

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is the back of the head.

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why? It doesn't go in like this, right?

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It goes in like this.

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The earth comes out while rotating like this, right?

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What!?

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Rotating like this.

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's so weird!

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So if I say, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The earth comes out like this, so I'm like, what are you doing!?

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It comes out like this.

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
At first, I immediately started crying.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Huh?

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I immediately started crying.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't know about that, but I was outside and I heard a cry.

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was outside and I heard a cry.

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What was that?

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I heard a really loud cry.

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was really moved.

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And it was like this.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It was like this, right?

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Huh?

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why was it like this?

285
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I opened the door and ran around.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And the name, what was it? I gave it a name.

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What was it?

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Ikumi.

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ikumi.

290
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't do that.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ikumi.

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You gave it a name?

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

294
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was like, what!?

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You said you'd give it a name.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's right! You can't ask me to do it!

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why can't I ask you to do it?

298
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you were a comedian, you should have given it a funny name.

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ikumi-kun?

300
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's with that Ikumi-kun?

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What is it?

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's sake!

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Bring me sake!

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What's an interesting name?

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's...

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Maeba-bon!

307
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You should ask yourself.

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you were born as my child, would you give it a name like Matsumoto Maeba-bon?

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's right!

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Think about it!

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You don't want to give it a name? Bring me sake!

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're that young! You can't laugh!

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You should give it a name.

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

315
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you were born as my child, would you give it a name?

316
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm a copy robot.

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What's with the perm?

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm thinking of names like Sato or Tanaka.

319
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'd give it a name like Suzuki.

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'd call it Matsumoto Sato.

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can't make me laugh!

322
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Bring it on!

323
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like Matsumotoppe.

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Bring it on!

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Like Matsumotoppe.

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Bring it on!

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's right.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You can't call it a sentence.

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Like Matsumotokana.

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like Matsumotodayo.

331
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, it's a sentence.

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If you keep calling it that...

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If I wake up in the morning, I'll call it Matsumoto.

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can't call it a sentence.

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll call it a sentence.

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You can't call it a sentence.

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll call it a sentence too, but if you're born again, you can call it Saki.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't want to.

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're not manly.

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm not manly.

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why didn't you ask me?

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why?

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Did you ask Sanma?

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes.

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Did you ask her?

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If it was me, I would have asked her.

347
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You should have asked her on TV.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're thinking of weird things.

349
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're only thinking of weird things.

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're not thinking of making it right, are you?

351
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's about people anyway.

352
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're so annoying!

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's like...

354
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's like...

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's like the first day of the waiter,

356
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's like the first day of the waiter, Mr. Japayuki.

357
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What is that?

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What is that?

359
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm amazing.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I've been up for about 30 hours today.

361
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You don't have to brag about it.

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm going home early today.

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sleepy.

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
When I get home, I'll be like...

365
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll be like...

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's funny.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll be like...

368
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll be like...

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll be like...

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll be like...

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll be like...

372
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was given a job when I was in high school.

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I was given a job when I was in high school.

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm an old lady in Osaka.

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This is nothing.

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I said,

377
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I thought,

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I thought,

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'd wake up again at night.

380
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I woke up, Mom!

381
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I woke up, Mom!

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can't do that, okay?

383
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't do that, okay?

384
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll do it, okay?

385
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll do it, okay?

386
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the winter...

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You don't have to do that to wake me up.

388
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay!

389
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What are you doing?

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I feel sorry for you.

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I feel sorry for you, but I can't help it.

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Stop it. Let me sleep.

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hitoshi, you should shake your butt and beg.

394
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Who?

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This guy is an idiot.

396
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You said it today, right?

397
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm going to get out of downtown.

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not in a band.

399
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's what you are.

400
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You said you were going to get out of guitar and bass.

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You said you were going to get out of downtown.

402
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What are you going to do by getting out of downtown?

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What are you going to do?

404
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What are you going to do by getting out of downtown?

405
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Well...

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
At this time, I'm going to start laughing.

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm going to do something funny in front of the producer.

408
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't laugh!

409
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Come on out.

410
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you a general today?

411
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes.

412
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What are you doing now?

413
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
From April, I decided to study for 35 minutes.

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What do you study?

415
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I want to be a musician.

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I see.

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You look funny.

418
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What is the meaning of this word?

419
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know.

420
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Really? Why?

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I have an old man and an old woman.

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You have an old woman and an old woman.

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't say such a big thing.

424
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Don't you usually say something like,

425
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I have an injury, so I'm scared.

426
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You are a civilized person.

427
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm not a civilized person.

428
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you don't know,

429
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If you ask about the disease of the anus,

430
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'll give you 25,000 questions.

431
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Say it.

432
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well...

433
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Anus...

434
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ressho.

435
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thank you very much.

436
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you very much.

437
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Mr. Yukiko Abe.

438
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Hello.

439
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is a popular game in my class.

440
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll give you a quiz.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is the Shinkansen a man or a woman?

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know, but it's a man.

443
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why is that?

444
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know.

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is the Shinkansen a man or a woman?

446
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This is a man.

447
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why?

448
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Because it flies the station.

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I see.

450
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's an adult joke.

451
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I see.

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I see.

453
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Is the umbrella a man or a woman?

454
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Woman.

455
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Why?

456
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Because...

457
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I got hit by the rain.

458
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm wet.

459
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, my God.

460
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm wet.

461
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If you get hit by the rain, you're wet.

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm wet.

463
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The answer is woman.

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I got hit by the rain.

465
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Men and women are in everything in this world.

466
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Is that so?

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's right.

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
For example?

469
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Men and women are in everything in this world.

470
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

471
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This table?

472
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's right.

473
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Which one is this?

474
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Which one is this?

475
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't you know this?

476
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tell me quickly.

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I know gender and age.

478
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which one is it?

479
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Which one is it?

480
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is a man.

481
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How old is he?

482
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Thirty.

483
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Why?

484
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What's the reason?

485
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll be thirty this year.

486
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why?

487
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why?

488
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There's a reason for this.

489
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Men and women are in everything in this world.

490
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is a child's play.

491
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What's the reason?

492
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
There's a reason.

493
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's no reason.

494
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
How old are you?

495
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Twenty-seven.

496
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Is it a man or a woman?

497
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's a man.

498
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why?

499
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't know.

500
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Where is it?

501
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Can you show me?

502
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Can you show me?

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's good.

504
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm impressed.

505
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's good.

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's good.

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What?

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Can you give it to me?

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Give it to me.

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why are you looking at me?

511
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I made it.

512
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is a man and a woman.

513
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I feel sorry for one of them.

514
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
This is a man and a woman.

515
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll give it to you.

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hello.

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
As I said last week,

518
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I have an announcement to make.

519
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000

with the boys and girls

523
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
in the special program.

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's surprise them.

We are looking for assistants.

535
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We are looking for assistants.

536
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We have a lot of assistants

537
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000

Anything else?

Let me see.

544
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We should find assistants.

545
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I see.

546
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm looking forward to it.

547
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000

I'd like to ask you to do it through this on-air.

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is it okay, Otomo?

552
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes.

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I look forward to working with you.

554
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He's got smoke coming out of his head.

555
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's all for this week's Dantan's Child's Play.

556
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Until next week, goodbye!
