1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
There's no place for kids in downtown, so have fun.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Let's have a drink and have a good time!

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
So, what are we doing today?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, Team Zero has been making a lot of appearances in the opening.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'd like to see their talent.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's have a drink and have a good time.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's have a drink and have a good time.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, this is how it's set up.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's right.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, let's have a drink and have a good time.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We can't stop drinking with comedians.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is that so?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I drank twice when I made my debut.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Drink!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, let's have a drink and have a good time.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
By the way, if you drink on the stage and have to throw up,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
this is a serious story.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Team Zero will never be used on this program again.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's have a drink and have a good time.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We need more and more newcomers.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We'll have them do the story.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Do you really want us to do the story?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Of course.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You guys are dressed like that.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Merry Christmas!

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mom, I'm a little excited.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Get out.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm kidding.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Get out.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Get out!

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's wrong?

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's wrong?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What happened?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mom, I don't understand at all.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You'll understand when I play for you.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good job, Miyabuta.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mom, are you fat?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Mom, are you fat?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, don't lead the way!

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't lead the way!

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Dear Santa,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When I turn 20,

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I want to get on the Countach.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's called Hosei.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bring me a present from Santa Claus.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't tell me...

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a lie, you idiot!

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a lie!

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hey, that's too easy!

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you doing?

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Easy, easy!

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you doing?

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sit down, sit down.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sit down, sit down.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Give him a drink.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, thank you.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Good job, Mr. Utae.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Good job, Mr. Utae.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Here you go.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Drink up!

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Drink up!

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Drink up!

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Drink up!

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Drink up!

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Drink up!

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Drink up!

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Drink up until you run out of bubbles.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Get on the Countach, we'll take turn.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Here you go.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Drink up!

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Drink up!

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Drink up!

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Drink up!

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Drink up!

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Over there, that's isn't their place.

79
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,280
I'll go quick.

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,620
I don't know who are you telling to do so

81
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,420
Okay let's go.

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,920
Let's do this.

83
00:03:42,920 --> 00:04:07,160
3, 2, 1, go!

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah!

85
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,160
It's fun, isn't it?

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,160
It's fun, isn't it?

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Yamazaki, how's the recent downtown?

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
It's a little tough.

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,160
It's really tough?

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,160
I really want to see you in yellow.

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Let's drink! Let's drink!

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Let's drink!

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,160
We're the ones in the TV.

94
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
We're competing.

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
That's all.

96
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Please come again. Thank you very much.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
60%, 70%, 80%

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
I'm doing it.

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
How is it?

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
It's like a 3 o'clock party.

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
It's a bubble!

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
It's a bubble!

103
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,160
It's like a 3 o'clock party.

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
You're drinking!

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,160
It's like a Hamachan.

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
I like it.

107
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Thank you.

108
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I like it.

109
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Really, this is...

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,160
I really can't say it.

111
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I really can't say it.

112
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I...

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Thank you.

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Thank you.

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Thank you very much.

116
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Thank you very much.

117
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Thank you very much.

118
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Thank you very much.

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,160
It's like a 3 o'clock party.

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Thank you very much.

121
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm giving you a Christmas of two mothers.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
But it's okay.

123
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Because there's love.

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:49,160
But, I got a letter from my husband for 10 years.

125
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,160
What's wrong?

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,160
What's wrong?

127
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,160
I don't know what to do.

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I'll go up to my husband.

129
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Let's sing a song.

130
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Christmas.

131
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Everybody's thinking now.

132
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Don't cry!

133
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Thank you very much.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Is this on air?

135
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Thank you very much.

136
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Thank you very much.

137
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Thank you very much.

138
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Give me a hug.

139
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
It's the best!

140
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
It's the best!

141
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:54,160
I don't know what to do.

142
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
What is it today?

144
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Wait a minute.

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,160
What is it today?

146
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Camera.

147
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,160
It's so cool!

148
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
What is it?

149
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
What is it?

150
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,160
It's so easy to set your hair.

151
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's so easy to set your hair.

152
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Isn't this good?

153
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Let's do it.

154
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Especially in Tokyo, at the end of the year, the road is crowded.

155
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
It's annoying.

156
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
There are so many cars.

157
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,160
That's because I'm the first to go.

158
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,160
On the contrary, drivers in Tokyo are stopped at the yellow sign.

159
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
That's true.

160
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Why is it stopped at the yellow sign?

161
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I want you to see that.

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
If you stop at the yellow sign in Osaka, you'll get a fine.

163
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I'll get a fine.

164
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I'll get a fine.

165
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
If you stop at the yellow sign in Osaka, you'll get a fine.

166
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I'll get a fine.

167
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I'll get a fine.

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
I'll get a fine.

169
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
I don't know.

170
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm the one who cares about cars.

171
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm the one who cares about cars.

172
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm the one who cares about cars.

173
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't know at all.

174
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,160
The other day, when I stopped at the yellow sign in Shinjuku, there was a fight.

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I hit him.

176
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
He came down and said,

177
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
No, I didn't hit him.

178
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
You're hurt, aren't you?

179
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,160
No, I'm not hurt.

180
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
We're looking at each other like this.

181
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Look at this.

182
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Look at this.

183
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I thought he was a fish.

184
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
I don't know.

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I wonder if he'll be interested in me.

186
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm sure he will.

187
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
When I was on the bus, I was like that.

188
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
If I hit him, he'll be depressed.

189
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
I don't think it's funny.

190
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,160
The third day, I hit him on the door.

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
I don't think it's funny.

192
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I don't think it's funny.

193
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
The other day, I hit him on the guardrail.

194
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I hit him again.

195
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I hit him again.

196
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Humans are stupid.

197
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm worried about that.

198
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm not worried about animals.

199
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I hit him on the dog house.

200
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I don't think he'll look at me.

201
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I don't think it's funny.

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
I don't think it's funny.

203
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
I'm serious.

204
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm not worried about animals.

205
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
It's not funny.

206
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
I'm concerned about animals.

207
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
I'm worried about animals.

208
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I think I'll hit him.

209
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I hit him.

210
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm serious.

211
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I don't think it's funny.

212
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
It's so cold.

213
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
It's raining.

214
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I can't stand it.

215
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
I'll go to the car.

216
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I was about to go to the car.

217
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
I was like this.

218
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I was so angry.

219
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:09,160
I was like this again.

220
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I can't stand it.

221
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
What's wrong with you?

222
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
You're the boyfriend of Baikinman.

223
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I don't know.

224
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I don't know that.

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I stopped the car once.

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I played for a while.

227
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
I came back.

228
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,160
The front glass was broken.

229
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
The door of the car was broken.

230
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
It was written here.

231
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
It was written in magic.

232
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
I came back from work.

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
You came back from work.

234
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
That's right.

235
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
I looked at the back of the car.

236
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
The back of the car was broken.

237
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
It was broken.

238
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
It was broken.

239
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
I thought I was going home.

240
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
That's right.

241
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
I thought I was going home.

242
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
What?

243
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,160
My car was shining.

244
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
It was so bright.

245
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
It was like a jewel box.

246
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
It was shining.

247
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
I thought I was going home.

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
The back of the car was broken.

249
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
The side was broken.

250
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
The inside was full of glass.

251
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
That was hard.

252
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
That was hard.

253
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
But I could laugh.

254
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
You can't laugh.

255
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
You can't go home.

256
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,160
If I have a driver's license, I'll be in trouble.

257
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Do you have a driver's license?

258
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
I still have a driver's license.

259
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,160
But I can't go home.

260
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,160
I looked at my car.

261
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I could see it was broken.

262
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I had a driver's license.

263
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
I could see it was broken.

264
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
That's not true.

265
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
It was broken.

266
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,160
You're a fool.

267
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
How about that?

268
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
That's impossible.

269
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I've been to Okamahora twice.

270
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
I've forgiven everything.

271
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I said, it's okay.

272
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,160
You're a bit old.

273
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Why?

274
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
That's strange.

275
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,160
If only the steering wheel, the steering wheel and the frame were left, it would be fine.

276
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
I would run like Lupin.

277
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
You are not an anime character.

278
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
You run with your bones down.

279
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
By the way, the car is like this.

280
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
This guy is amazing.

281
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
The car is like a president.

282
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,160
This guy is riding a Century.

283
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
You are amazing.

284
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
You are riding a Camaro too.

285
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Camaro and Century are completely different.

286
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I am an international Century.

287
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
The price is completely different.

288
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
That's not true. You are riding a Camaro too.

289
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Is it 4 million yen?

290
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
It's like this with cash.

291
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I am riding a Camaro for 4 million yen.

292
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
What is this Century?

293
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Thank you.

294
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
In my head, I think the Century is higher.

295
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
That's fine.

296
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Last week, I took a break.

297
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
What was it?

298
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Punishment game?

299
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
The punishment game we played until now.

300
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Everyone, please watch it.

301
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
I was playing all night.

302
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I thought I would start little by little.

303
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
You started when you were about a year old.

304
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
That's right.

305
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I had to decide what to bet on.

306
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I thought I would bet on Kouhaku.

307
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
What do you think?

308
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I don't know the members.

309
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I am sorry.

310
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Kouhaku members.

311
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
We can make it. We can make it until next week.

312
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
We can make it next week.

313
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Let's decide next week.

314
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Which one is red or white.

315
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Then, we will have power.

316
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
We will know when we are older.

317
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Let's decide what to do.

318
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Punishment game?

319
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
It's been a long time.

320
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Shall we pull our teeth?

321
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Let's stop it.

322
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Why do we have to pull our teeth?

323
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Why do we have to pull our teeth?

324
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
What should we do?

325
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Let's make it physical.

326
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Let's stop it.

327
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
If we lose, we will have to go to the hospital and open our brains.

328
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Then, we will be written as a fool.

329
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Then, we will be written as a fool.

330
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
You are so good at it.

331
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Let's stop it.

332
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Is there any punishment game?

333
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,160
If you are bored, you can play a game instead of an object.

334
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
What is it?

335
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
What is it?

336
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Business.

337
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
What is business?

338
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
If you play roulette, it will go like this.

339
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
At that time, it will go like this.

340
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
If you take 400,000 yen, it will go like this.

341
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
If you take 400,000 yen, it will go like this.

342
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Your face will go like this.

343
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
It is possible.

344
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
It is possible.

345
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
But, I want to play this game instead of a punishment game.

346
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
It is interesting.

347
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
What is there?

348
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Let's play Cupid's 3-minute cooking.

349
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
What should we do with Cupid's 3-minute cooking?

350
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Let's put Cupid's 3-minute cooking next to you.

351
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,160
You can change the punishment for me and for you.

352
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
If I lose, you will eat Cupid's 3-minute cooking.

353
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
What if I lose?

354
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
If you lose, you will eat bungee jumping.

355
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Really?

356
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Why can't I fix it?

357
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I almost died once.

358
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
You should also jump once.

359
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I can't jump.

360
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Why can't you jump?

361
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
When you were on the plane, you said,

362
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Goodbye.

363
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
You said it for a long time.

364
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
I can't do it.

365
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
You can't do it.

366
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I can't fall.

367
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
You can fall.

368
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I can't fall.

369
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Why do you say that?

370
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
You can fall.

371
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,160
When I was on the plane, the teacher was here.

372
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
If the teacher moved, I couldn't move.

373
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I was so weak.

374
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
If the teacher moved, I couldn't move.

375
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I can't fall.

376
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
No, no, no.

377
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
This is the sky.

378
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
If you come here, you will fall.

379
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
I can't fall.

380
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I will stand still.

381
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
This is a problem for me.

382
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Do it here.

383
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Do it here.

384
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Why do you say that?

385
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Stop here.

386
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
It's dangerous. Stop it.

387
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I said I can't fall.

388
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I have the feeling that it's dangerous.

389
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Even if you have the feeling, it's not dangerous.

390
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
You can do it. Stop here.

391
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
What?

392
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
You can't stop.

393
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
You can't fall.

394
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
You can't fall.

395
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Hama-chan.

396
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Thank you.

397
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Hello, Hama-chan.

398
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Actually, I saw something unexpected of you.

399
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
What is it?

400
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
When you entered the studio of Albano,

401
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
you said you can laugh on December 3rd.

402
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
It's good that you came out of the car in a cool way,

403
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
but you got caught in a chain and fell.

404
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
I remember that your face was bright red.

405
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
You are a bastard.

406
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
There is no such time.

407
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
There is no such time.

408
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Big brother.

409
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Big brother.

410
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
There is such a time, isn't it?

411
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
There is no such time.

412
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Really?

413
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
You got into the car suddenly.

414
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
When I got into the car...

415
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
There is a chain.

416
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
There is a chain like this.

417
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
That's right.

418
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
It's not so bad that you can cross it.

419
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
If you can cross it, then cross it.

420
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
I know that.

421
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,160
There is an older brother of Honda Gano.

422
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Can you do this for me?

423
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
When I got out of the car,

424
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
I ran out of the car.

425
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
I thought you came.

426
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
I thought I should go.

427
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I thought I should go.

428
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
When I thought I should go,

429
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
I got out of the car.

430
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
You are so cool.

431
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
If you do this for me,

432
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
I will go home soon.

433
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Did you go home?

434
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
If you do this for me,

435
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
I will cry on the bed.

436
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
You are not so sad.

437
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
You are so cool.

438
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
If I don't go home,

439
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I will cry on the bed.

440
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
I will call my mother.

441
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
I will tell her that I fell down.

442
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
You are so cool.

443
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I have fallen down.

444
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I have never fallen down so much.

445
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Really?

446
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
But yesterday,

447
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
I was a little bit cool.

448
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
What did you do yesterday?

449
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Yesterday,

450
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I was shooting a movie.

451
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I dressed up as a monkey.

452
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I dressed up as a monkey.

453
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I wanted to go to the toilet.

454
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I went to the toilet.

455
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I went to the toilet.

456
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I came back.

457
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
I went to the studio.

458
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
I dressed up as a monkey.

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I looked around.

460
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
I didn't see many staffs.

461
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Thanks to everyone.

462
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I didn't see any staffs.

463
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
You are so cool.

464
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
I don't think so.

465
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
I thought it was my studio.

466
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
I didn't dress up as a monkey.

467
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I didn't dress up as a monkey.

468
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I dressed up as a monkey.

469
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I looked around.

470
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I didn't see many staffs.

471
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I didn't think I was going to shoot a movie.

472
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
When I saw you,

473
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
I thought you were Matsumoto.

474
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
You are so cool.

475
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I will never see you again.

476
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
You are so cool.

477
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
You are not cool.

478
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
You are not cool.

479
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
You are cool.

480
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
You are so cool.

481
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Your face is so red.

482
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
You are so cool.

483
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
When you are so cool,

484
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
How much you can be upset.

485
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
When I try to be upset,

486
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
I am caught in a trouble.

487
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
I am taken away.

488
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
I am so confused.

489
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
I can't go like this.

490
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
If you were alone,

491
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I would be fine.

492
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,160
If it's like this, it's going to be like this.

493
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
That's not good.

494
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
That's not cool.

495
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
That's not good.

496
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
That's not cool.

497
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Have you ever opened the bathroom door?

498
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,160
I've opened it, but I've never opened it.

499
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,160
When you open it, it depends on how tight it is.

500
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
It's tight.

501
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,160
If you open it too much, it depends on how you want it.

502
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
If you open it like this,

503
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
If you open it too much,

504
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
If you open it too much,

505
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
If you open it too much,

506
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,160
It's going to be normal.

507
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
It's going to be normal if you open it.

508
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,160
It's going to be like this.

509
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I don't know how to say it.

510
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,160
It's going to be like this.

511
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Like this?

512
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:33,160
What is this?
