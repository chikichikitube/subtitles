1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What could it be?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good evening everyone, I'm Masatoshi Hamada from Hikari.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, we have a fortune-telling quiz.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We have three panellists here with us.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to ask them to tell us their fortune.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's get started.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
First, to my left, we have a dancing fortune-teller, Mayuzumi Asumi-sensei.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Next, we have a fortune-teller, Nagisa Hoshi-sensei.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Lastly, we have this guy.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, I'm a fortune-teller, Matsumoto.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What kind of fortune-telling do you do?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, when you pull it out...

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, to see if there's meat on it.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What kind of fortune-telling do you do?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here's the first question.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here's the question. Where am I?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please look at this screen.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are a lot of people here, but I'm one of them.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
First, the dancing fortune-teller, Mayuzumi Asumi-sensei.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here we go.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Where are you going?

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, I'm going to roll the dice.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm very energetic.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When you sat down just now, your heart was shaking.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's okay, it's okay.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's okay, right?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're getting in the way.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's usually on the top of the picture on the panel, right?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
On the top left.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Around here?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
On the left.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
On the left?

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is the center.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is the center?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Around here.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Around here.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Around here?

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now, Nagisa-sensei, please.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I see.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wow, I got it.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can feel the power from here.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I see, from this half circle.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I see.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Judging from that,

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is it on the right side?

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can feel it on the right side.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Around here, right?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's on the corner.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This shoulder?

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This shoulder is me, but it's this shoulder, right?

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Around here.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Around here, right?

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, Masao-sensei.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is that, right?

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Probably,

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Rather than fortune-telling,

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My comedian soul gets excited.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, rather than fortune-telling?

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The nose.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's you.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The nose?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can wear it.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Which one?

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The nose.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The one in front of you.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This one?

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can wear it.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can wear it?

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is different from the nose.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What is it?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is a person's shirt.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Haha.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, it's the nose.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not the nose?

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not the nose.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's the nose.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the shirt's pattern.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, really?

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hahaha.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, really?

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hahaha.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is that.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Which one?

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That one.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This?

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You can wear it.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The answer is this.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's correct.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm here.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Please look down on them.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hahaha.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm here.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So the correct answer is Maezumi sensei.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hahaha.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, it's the last question.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you ready?

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The last question, VTR.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Here we go.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's a picture on the darts.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Please look at it.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ucchan, Nanchan, Bandage-san, Tamori-san, Matsumoto Hitoshi-san,

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Kamio Kari Yutaro-san, Yokoyama Yasushi-san, Katsura Sanshi-san,

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and our Suga.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hahaha.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Now, this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
out of the eight pictures,

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
who am I going to target with this one?

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hahaha.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the last question.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hahaha.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, think!

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Whose picture are you going to target?

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is the last question.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I got it.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You got it?

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who are you going to target?

128
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Katsura Sanshi-san.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I got it.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Maezumi sensei is going to target Katsura Sanshi-san.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now, Nagisa sensei, please.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She is very kind-hearted.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
She is kind-hearted,

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but she has a strong power

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
when it comes to targeting people with a sharp tongue.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is that so?

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can feel her power.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then,

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Kamio Kari Yutaro-san.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, I got it.

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Who is the last one?

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is Yasu-san, isn't it?

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, Yokoyama Yasu-san?

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is that so?

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He was in front of the frame of Yasu-san's glasses.

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is a grudge that he was hit against the wall

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
at a TV show in the past.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't say such a thing.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hahaha.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I thought about it from that day.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I haven't forgotten it yet.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hahaha.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sensei got all the answers.

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Here is the correct answer.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wow.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hahaha.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The correct answer is

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Master Sanshi.

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
As expected, isn't it?

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
As expected.

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hahaha.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I got it.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What is this atmosphere?

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I got it.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why did you come here?

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If you didn't apply for it,

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you wouldn't have done this.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is...

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But the staff said

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
this is the last time.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hahaha.

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's disgusting.

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Even if you say that,

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I can't do it.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I got it.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's pretty good.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But there is no one who calls me Hama-chan.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm here.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hahaha.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you call everyone Hama-chan...

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't feel good.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just once.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
One, two.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hama-chan.

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hahaha.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll put in matcha.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll be on air.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Matsu.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hahaha.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
One, two.

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Matcha.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
One, two.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Matcha.

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wow.

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't do it.

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's disgusting.

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But everyone is fine.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Really.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Men...

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
To tell you the truth,

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
you have to ask men to do comedy.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's true.

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Women...

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If it's the next day,

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
you'll like a completely different person.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's true.

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you like a man once,

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you'll fall in love.

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a long time.

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's fine.

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But men...

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Men's fans...

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's weird.

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
For example, what's weird?

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Even if you're walking down the street,

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
if you say,

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
please shake my hand,

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
it's fine.

226
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But if you say,

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll hit you.

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It hurts a little.

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The other day,

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I went to a disco.

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I thought I'd go to the bathroom and go home.

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
My butt hit me from behind.

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hahaha.

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's...

235
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's not a hit.

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's just that I hate you.

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was angry.

238
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I looked back.

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I looked back.

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Everyone looked like they didn't know.

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know.

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Who...

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who told you to watch a mini-con at a disco?

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know.

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was angry.

246
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I wanted you to stop kicking my butt.

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's not like you made a mistake with someone.

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No, no.

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's not it.

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There must be something.

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You hate me, don't you?

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you think about it?

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

254
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When I went to a disco in Kyoto,

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that was the scariest thing.

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That thing.

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Machan.

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Machan.

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's go.

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What?

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Disco?

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's go.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Take me to the bathroom.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Take you to the bathroom.

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's go.

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you doing?

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There was a real one.

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hahaha.

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is...

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's what it looked like, right?

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Here?

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hahaha.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When I said let's go,

275
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I felt like I was going to take off my underwear.

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hahaha.

277
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But there are people like that.

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That kind of thing.

279
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I like that woman a little bit.

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can't go to Kyoto.

281
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There are people who say that.

282
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm a little bit.

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't give it to you.

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But there are more than 100 people, right?

285
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There are about 100 people, right?

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah.

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
After all, there are one or two people.

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, there are.

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There are more people like that these days.

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is that so?

291
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think there will definitely be.

292
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hmm.

293
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What makes you feel good?

294
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What makes you feel good?

295
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So...

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hahaha.

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,180
It's nothing but a

298
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,200
I don't think so, but that's a butt, isn't it?

299
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Hmm.

300
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Well, the one who has a butt is weak.

301
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Hmm.

302
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
The one who has a butt.

303
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Hahaha.

304
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Feelings.

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
What's going on here?

306
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
It's already flat.

307
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Hahaha.

308
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Why am I here with such a guy now?

309
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Hahaha.

310
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,200
That means the one who has a butt can't have another butt.

311
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I can't.

312
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Hahaha.

313
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
That's what I'm saying.

314
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
If that happens, it will be a circle.

315
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Why?

316
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Hahaha.

317
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
That's not true.

318
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
It's amazing, isn't it?

319
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
If you come this way with such a circle.

320
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Hahaha.

321
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Wow.

322
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Hahaha.

323
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
That's terrible, isn't it?

324
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Yeah.

325
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
That's right.

326
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
It's a scary world, isn't it?

327
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I don't know.

328
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
That's right.

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Men are all bad.

330
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Men in the world.

331
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Well.

332
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm sure everyone has gone to buy konjac when they were in junior high school.

333
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Hahaha.

334
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Hahaha.

335
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
No.

336
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
That's just a special guy.

337
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I went.

338
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Hahaha.

339
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
That's why I'm saying it's just a special guy.

340
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
I can't forget it when I was in junior high school.

341
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
No.

342
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
It was when I was in the first year of junior high school.

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Well.

344
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I went to buy school uniforms when I was in junior high school.

345
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I was really interested in konjac at that time.

346
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Hahaha.

347
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I was really interested in konjac.

348
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Well.

349
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I bought school uniforms and everyone said,

350
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Mom, I'm going to go shopping.

351
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
I'll go home first.

352
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I'll go home first.

353
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I have an appointment.

354
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Well.

355
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I bought konjac.

356
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
You have an appointment with konjac?

357
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Hahaha.

358
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Well.

359
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I'll put it in.

360
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Well.

361
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I baked tofu.

362
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I said, give me konjac.

363
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
That's what you did.

364
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Hahaha.

365
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Well.

366
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm laughing.

367
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Hahaha.

368
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Well.

369
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
You're laughing.

370
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Well.

371
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm laughing.

372
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Well.

373
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Well.

374
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Well.

375
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I did I'm cutting my wife in the middle of the sword with a knife.

376
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Oh I'm sorry.

377
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I think it's about as rushed as any woman.

378
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Do not imitate anything.

379
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Hahaha.

380
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Come on.

381
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
What have I done it somehow.

382
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Do it with a knife somewhere.

383
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I did not.

384
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
To the middle of the sword.

385
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Well.

386
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I knew how to do.

387
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Well.

388
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I was sad about one thing.

389
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Uh.

390
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:16,280
It is a very red red without

391
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
agar.

392
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
I thought he was Yota Kanwa.

393
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I thought he was done with the fairy tale.

394
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
What are you talking about?

395
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I completely forgot about the konjac.

396
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
You used it?

397
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I completely forgot about it.

398
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I left it somewhere and went to play.

399
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,280
It wasn't a story or anything.

400
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
When I went to play, I was surprised.

401
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
I left the konjac there.

402
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Was it dangerous?

403
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Of course it was dangerous.

404
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Why did you leave the konjac there?

405
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,280
My mom and everyone came back from shopping.

406
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I opened it and found the konjac.

407
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
I was like, what is this?

408
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
I know what this is.

409
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,280
I know what this is, but I don't think it's human.

410
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
I don't think so.

411
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,280
I got tired of playing and went home in the evening.

412
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I went to the place where the konjac was supposed to be.

413
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
There was no konjac.

414
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Where did it go?

415
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I thought I left it there.

416
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I thought I left it there.

417
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
You forgot about it.

418
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
I forgot about it.

419
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I thought I had to take care of it.

420
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
I opened the fridge and it was in there.

421
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
The konjac was in the middle.

422
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
The konjac was in the middle.

423
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
It was in the fridge.

424
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I was surprised.

425
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I didn't know that.

426
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
I didn't know that.

427
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
I still don't know.

428
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
I knew.

429
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
I knew.

430
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,280
I knew that there was no way to do it.

431
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I knew that there was no way to do it.

432
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,280
If you knew, you wouldn't have cooled it down.

433
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,280
If you knew, you wouldn't have cooled it down.

434
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I didn't know that.

435
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I didn't know that.

436
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
What is that?

437
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
I didn't know that.

438
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I didn't know that.

439
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I didn't know that.

440
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
That's a problem.

441
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
That's a problem.

442
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Women are good.

443
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
What do you mean?

444
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I thought women were bad.

445
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I thought women were bad.

446
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,280
There are people who talk to you when you're walking down the street.

447
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
If it's like that, then it's like that.

448
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Men can't stand it.

449
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
But it can't be helped.

450
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Even if everyone was there.

451
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I want to think about it a little more.

452
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,280
I don't care if you don't like it.

453
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,280
That's what everyone thinks.

454
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
If you don't want me to do it, I can't help it.

455
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Don't say that.

456
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Don't say that.

457
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
It's okay to be straightforward.

458
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Women don't like it.

459
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Don't say that.

460
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Women don't like it.

461
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,280
What you don't like.

462
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
What I want to do.

463
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
What I want to do.

464
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Women don't like it.

465
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,280
What kind of reason is that?

466
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Women don't like it more than you want to do it.

467
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
That's not true.

468
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,280
They don't like it that much.

469
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Can I take a shit?

470
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Women don't like it.

471
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I'm sorry.

472
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I didn't know this.

473
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
It's dirty.

474
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
It's dirty.

475
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,280
If I had a woman here, it would have been a mess.

476
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
It's dirty.

477
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
This is...

478
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Your father's hair is long.

479
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Amazing.

480
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
You pulled it out properly.

481
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
That's amazing.

482
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I still don't know where your assistant is.

483
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Death motive.

484
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
I fell in love with Hama-chan.

485
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Hey!

486
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
What is this?

487
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm a man, so I want to be sexy.

488
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I see.

489
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
You're an idiot.

490
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Thank you very much.

491
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Hello, I'm a 21-year-old college student.

492
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
I see you every week.

493
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Hama-chan's diving is so touching that I can't see the screen with tears.

494
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Sosuke!

495
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Please continue to do your best with your little finger.

496
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
This time it's a punishment game.

497
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Oh, that's right.

498
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
You have to close your fingers.

499
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Close your fingers.

500
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
That's why I'm doing my best with my little finger.

501
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I see.

502
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
I remembered when I closed my fingers.

503
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,280
My father once closed his fingers completely.

504
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
That's a door or something.

505
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
That's right.

506
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
It's like a human finger.

507
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,280
When you go to the bathroom, there's a door in the bathroom.

508
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
It's slippery.

509
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
It's slippery.

510
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,280
When you open it and close it, it's stuck.

511
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,280
It's like an echo in the bathroom.

512
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Wow!

513
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Did you make a voice like a foreign cartoonist?

514
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Was it okay?

515
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,280
It was purple for about half a year.

516
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Everyone was laughing.

517
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Please give me a pen name, Hama-chan.

518
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Okay.

519
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Is it a man?

520
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
It's a girl. A 17-year-old girl.

521
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Recently, I've been listening to my parents' sexy voice.

522
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,280
It's an old story.

523
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
It's an old story from a viewer, so it can't be helped.

524
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
The owner is a voice actor. It's not a big deal.

525
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,280
It's just a porn video that my father loves.

526
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,280
I have a big money and a porn that my brother loves.

527
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I have a family weakness.

528
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I wanted to tell this to someone, so I wrote it to Machan Hama-chan.

529
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Don't show it to me.

530
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
When I was a kid, I was sleeping next to my parents.

531
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,280
I've been watching and listening to my parents' sex from the beginning.

532
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Machan Hama-chan, have you ever seen and heard your parents' sex?

533
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
I don't have one.

534
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,280
You'll have a baby soon, so please don't show your parents' sex in front of them.

535
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
I don't have one.

536
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
You don't have one?

537
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
You have one.

538
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I really have one.

539
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Really?

540
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Yes, I really have one.

541
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
I have one.

542
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
That's a big deal.

543
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Actually, I don't have one.

544
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
What do you mean you don't have one?

545
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
I really have one.

546
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,280
So which one is it?

547
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,280
That's why I'm not docking.

548
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
You're not docking?

549
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,280
When I was in the fourth or fifth grade of elementary school,

550
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I forgot that I had a flute test today.

551
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,280
So I thought I'd take a flute test today.

552
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
You forgot your flute?

553
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I forgot my flute, so I thought I had to take it home.

554
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I had a little time before the first hour, so I thought I'd make it in time if I ran.

555
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:57,280
I ran, and when I opened the door, my dad was in his pants.

556
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,280
My mom was like this.

557
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
That's real.

558
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
That's real.

559
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Your mom's face was down.

560
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
My mom's face was down.

561
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
My dad's face was down, too.

562
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,280
It's a little half-laughing.

563
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Why are you laughing?

564
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,280
What's wrong with you?

565
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I didn't say anything, so I wrote it down.

566
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,280
The flute test that day is already worn out.

567
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
How was it today?

568
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
It was unusual for a boy to be so close.

569
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It was unusual, wasn't it?

570
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Yeah.

571
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Well, I can't help but talk about it.

572
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I can't help it.

573
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Because it's all men.

574
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,280
I was just talking, and I thought, if there's a war now, Japan will lose.

575
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,280
That's as far as it goes.

576
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
What's that?

577
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,280
I don't know why.

578
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Do you want to do something else?

579
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
But what are you going to do?

580
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
There's a lot of men.

581
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
There's a lot of stewardesses.

582
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
There's a lot of nurses.

583
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,280
There's a lot of nurses, though.

584
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Yeah.

585
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
What's wrong with that?

586
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
It's all men.

587
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,280
I'll do it if we do it.

588
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
That's what I'm saying, but you have more than 100 nurses.

589
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Everyone was smiling now.

590
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Everyone was smiling.

591
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
But what do you say?

592
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
It might be better to limit it.

593
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
By profession.

594
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Occasionally.

595
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Yeah.

596
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Every time, every time.

597
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
There's a strange teacher at school.

598
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Mr. Hobo.

599
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
You're going in the wrong direction.

600
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Why is Mr. Hobo wrong?

601
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Why is Mr. Hobo wrong?

602
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
The teacher at school.

603
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Mr. Hobo is not wrong.

604
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,280
You're wrong when you see Mr. Hobo.

605
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Mr. Hobo is not wrong.

606
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
What's that?

607
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Let's think about it by profession.

608
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
That's right.

609
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Nice.

610
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I'll do it again next time.

611
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I'll let you know at that time.

612
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
That's all for this time.

613
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
See you next week.

614
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Good-bye.
