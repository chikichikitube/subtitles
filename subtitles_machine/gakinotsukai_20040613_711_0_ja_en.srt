1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the first episode, we will be talking about the story of the child's use.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yamazaki Ose, 36 years old, same age, talent, 1000 yen cut, Last Samurai!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yamachan is outside, right?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It feels like he was taken out.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, I'm Yamazaki Ose.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I know.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today, I think I beat a comedian of the same age as me.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm 36 years old, and I'm Niji's father.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Niji's father?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,800
I don't need those characters anymore!

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Well, that's something you've said a lot.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,700
Right?

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,600
Well, honestly...

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
That's what I mean.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,000
How many of them are there?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
The 36-year-old game character.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,800
There's a lot of them.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,600
Yamamoto Kokuraku, Hoto Yamaguchi...

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Today, I thought I'd beat this guy first.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Oh, wow!

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, wow!

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,800
Are you the same age?

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Mr. Higashino.

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Look at this guy!

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
He's a senior.

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
I have to defeat him to get my love.

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Look at this cold-hearted guy!

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,800
He's a person who has never loved anyone.

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
He once threw a dead turtle into a trash can.

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
He said, BOOM!

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Can you imagine?

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
He's such a person. I have to defeat him!

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I see.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
You are the enemy of society.

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
What can I defeat?

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
What is the thing that I can be the best?

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Well, it's not comedy.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Well, comedy is also the same.

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Sword!

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
What is the sword?

42
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
It's the sword art.

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Sword art.

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
I'll show you the sword art today.

45
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
That's why you're wearing this today?

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Of course.

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
I'm calling that guy, Kouji Higashino.

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Really?

49
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Come out!

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Good morning!

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
It's been a while!

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
It's been a while for the Konoha group

53
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Have you been out?

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I have. I took off my underwear.

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I took off my underwear here.

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I don't remember at all.

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,800
No, no, I'm not in the east.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I came to Dubai.

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
No, you came to Dubai, so you're in the middle of the Haneda.

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Sorry, sorry.

62
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:19,480
It's like a matcha and a

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Wait a minute.

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Ah, don't pull it down.

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Just a little.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
What the hell is that?

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
You bastard!

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
You're not worth anything!

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm sick of this.

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I don't care how many times you say that, but I don't have any money.

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
How many years have you been married?

72
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Two years.

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
You have a funny face.

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
He's really angry.

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I've been married for two years.

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Even if Sanae gets angry, I'll be fine.

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
First of all,

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Are you divorced?

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Why did you get divorced?

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
You're not the one to say that.

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I thought your family was the ideal.

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Thank you very much.

83
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Let's get back to work.

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Wait, Dachi-san!

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Wait a minute.

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I thought it would be better to say something real.

88
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,800
The reason I wanted to defeat you is because you're hard to get along with.

89
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
What?

90
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
You can see it now, right?

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
It's really hard to get along with.

92
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I see.

93
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
It's harder for me to get along with you.

94
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I want to beat you from the top!

95
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Okay, then let's end this with the one who has 10,000 points.

96
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I thought so too.

97
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
That's fine.

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Do the judgement.

99
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
The judgement of love.

100
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
I have 10,000 points.

101
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Are you ready, Anjou-san?

102
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes, yes.

103
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
The fight is about to begin.

104
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Do it seriously!

105
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Do it seriously!

106
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Of course I will!

107
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Do you think I'm going to do it with a lie?

108
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Don't say such cold things!

109
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
He's really angry.

110
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
It's really hard to get involved.

111
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I thought it was a woman.

112
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Yamada Keho is 36 years old.

113
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
That hurts.

114
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
He's 36 years old in the east.

115
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Last samurai.

116
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Ready?

117
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Start!

118
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Yamada-san, you were doing kendo.

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
You were so sloppy.

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Hit!

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Oh, no!

122
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
It's not even one point yet!

123
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
It's a tie!

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I can't do anything about this!

125
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I'll use my sword!

126
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
A sword is a sword!

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
A sword! A sword!

128
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
It's over!

129
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'll use my sword!

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I'll use my sword!

131
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
The last samurai!

132
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
What?

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
How is it?

134
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh no!

135
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Ken! Zaki-san, Ken!

136
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Kenjutsu!

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
What the hell!

138
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
It's Ken!

139
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Zaki-san, you're getting beaten!

140
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
You're getting beaten!

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,800
What the hell! Why are you getting beaten with a Ken?

142
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
What?

143
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh my

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
The end

145
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
What the hell

146
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
This game

147
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Kouji Higashino wins

148
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
This is the worst

149
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
The worst

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
The worst

151
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
The worst

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
The worst

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
The worst

154
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
The worst

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
The camera is a little bit out of order.

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
It's okay if you just do the last one, but just a little bit.

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Excuse me.

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
It's okay if you just do the last part of Yama-chan, but just a little bit.

159
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Excuse me.

160
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I want to see the part where you can hit Yama-chan's pie again with the Gizu table.

161
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Just the last part?

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
What?

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
That's not true!

164
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,800
You can't do that again.

165
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
That's the last scene.

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Really?

167
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
That's not true.

168
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I can't do that.

169
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I have a question.

170
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
That's the last scene.

171
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
The scene where you go like this.

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
No, no, no.

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,300
No, no, no.

174
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,800
Excuse me.

175
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,300
No, that's not it.

176
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,300
The last part of the tape is the part where the fire goes off.

177
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
And Yama-chan, the part where you fall is the part where you fall.

178
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
No, it's a little...

179
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
What's the problem?

180
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,300
The tape is not spinning at the end due to camera trouble.

181
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Why?

182
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,800
That's impossible.

183
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
This is...

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I don't know.

185
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
That's a little tough.

186
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
I don't know what to do with this.

187
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
No, it's not.

188
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,800
Where is it not spinning?

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,500
I got all the tape from half way that velocity.

190
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,540
Right.

191
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,960
She threw the tape from half way that velocity of her pie...

192
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
In half way what do you mean?

193
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,220
She didn't make any circle since she threw the pie away for иск?

194
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,380
She makes some circle, but her sometimes is jammed up somehow.

195
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,160
Some well Forming sensations in various electrical Contacts.

196
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,940
Nah, nah, nah, nah...

197
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
How long do you do circle?

198
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
About 5 minutes from the end of the video.

199
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,560
No, no!

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I think it's about 5 minutes.

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Yama-chan started and it took about half an hour.

202
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
That's tough.

203
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Why didn't you call me halfway?

204
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
You should have stopped me halfway.

205
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I'm sorry.

206
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
What?

207
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Yes.

208
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,560
You can't even get a third of the money.

209
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes.

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm sorry.

211
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
You've done the same thing over and over again!

212
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Yes.

213
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm sorry.

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
What are you going to do?

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
You can't do it again!

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Yes.

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
What are you going to do with the shakuhou?

218
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
You can't do it again. What are you going to do?

219
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
I have a plan.

220
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes.

221
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,560
What the hell is this?

222
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Yes.

223
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Sorry.

224
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
You should have done something.

225
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I want you to do something for me.

226
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Well, anyway...

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
For example, in Higashino...

228
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I want you to do something for me.

229
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
That's what I want.

230
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm not sure if I can do it.

231
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,560
It's been a while since I've had a pin-up.

232
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
You can't do the story you were doing.

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Senior.

234
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm grateful for that.

235
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Then, can you prepare a guest?

236
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Excuse me.

237
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Thank you.

238
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Can you wait a moment?

239
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Can you wait a moment?

240
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I thought you were going to say, I'm sorry.

241
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I was wondering why you weren't looking at the camera.

242
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Hey, who are you talking to?

243
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
We'll be back and talk about the eastern story.

244
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
You've got your costumes ready, right?

245
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Yes.

246
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Thank you.

247
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Thank you.

248
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
I wonder if it's a little too much.

249
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
I don't want to do it like this, but I wonder if it's a little too much.

250
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I can't move.

251
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
I'll be here all the time.

252
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Oh my god...

253
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Let me explain to the viewers once again.

254
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,560
This time, Yamazaki was the star of the show.

255
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
But it was all a lie.

256
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,560
The battle with Yamazaki and the pie he brought out were all a prank to make Higashino do the Senor.

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
The tape didn't stop.

258
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:59,560
The story of Senor is about 16 years ago, the story of Higashino who was doing a lot of muscle-baka character at the time of his debut, and he played it with high tension.

259
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
What's wrong?

260
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
West!

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
I'm not feeling well!

262
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Higashino decided to do a story related to it.

263
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Check the content in the old video.

264
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I was so happy.

265
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Today, Higashino is going to do a story.

266
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,560
There is a little bit of a story boom in the world.

267
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Even if you put a lot of effort into it, it's still a good story.

268
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,560
I think it would be good if I could do my best in a medium-sized place like this.

269
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,560
I think this would be a gold medal for comedy.

270
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh, there's a lot of Kami-san from Enta.

271
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I think I'm the type of person who can go out of the East.

272
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
There are already a lot of customers.

273
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Then, the East will do the story.

274
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
I'm looking forward to it.

275
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Let's listen to it.

276
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Toh!

277
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Toh!

278
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Toh!

279
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
This is funny.

280
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
The tension is different from the other one.

281
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Good evening.

282
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm Senor.

283
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Senor?

284
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
What's wrong with you, everyone?

285
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
You were so excited.

286
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
You're so mean!

287
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Cheer up, Mr. Miyashita!

288
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Today,

289
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I have a lot of worries.

290
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,560
I want to solve them.

291
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Please go out with me.

292
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
First, I'll give you my advice.

293
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
I respect you, Mr. Senor.

294
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I hate music time.

295
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,560
That's because I'm always teased by girls.

296
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,560
How can I become a good singer like you?

297
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
I can eat poop, right?

298
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
It's a very difficult problem.

299
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
It's a very difficult problem.

300
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Then let's solve it.

301
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
You don't have to sing.

302
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
That's it.

303
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Next.

304
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I'm the same.

305
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm a 14 year old pig.

306
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm being teased at school.

307
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,560
I want to be a body like you, and be popular with girls.

308
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
How can I become that body? Please tell me.

309
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Please give me your pen name.

310
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
The best pen name in the newspaper.

311
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
I got it.

312
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Then today, to become this body like Senor,

313
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
I will teach you specially the shape up exercise.

314
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Music start!

315
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Raise your legs!

316
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Next, bring the chair.

317
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Put your hands on it.

318
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Spread your legs.

319
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,560
And drop it.

320
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
And drop it.

321
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Your face is...

322
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Your legs are too long.

323
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I'll give you.

324
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I'll give it to you.

325
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Music stop!

327
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Don't say anything about today!

328
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
It's fluffy.

329
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I've seen it.

330
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Yes.

331
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Ai Hai?

332
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
What about the voice?

333
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
I don't know.

334
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
It's flying.

335
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Rather than flying, it's like...

336
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I can't speak.

337
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
You can't speak.

338
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
It's hot.

339
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,560
It's not a shock, it's like a mental pressure.

340
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
It's hot.

341
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Ah, I see.

342
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
I understand.

343
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
I thought it was a prank.

344
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Well, it was a prank.

345
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
It was a success.

346
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
What do you think is a success?

347
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Well, that...

348
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Don't be so mean!

349
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
No, I'm not!

350
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:04,560
We were just pranking Higashino, but in a way, the one who got the most pranked was the guest today.

351
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
What is this?

352
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
You're not like that!

353
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
If you want to be more beautiful, you should have come back to Senryo!

354
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Wakana...

355
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Say it!

356
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I was scared of the fall.

357
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Don't say such things.

358
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,560
But this is only in the exit.

359
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
From here, there are gold medals of laughter.

360
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
There are many places.

361
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
There is a god of entertainment.

362
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
I want you to go there.

363
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Me?

364
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
I want you to do your best in the lottery.

365
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Seriously?

366
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,560
You're going to make me do this?

367
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm going to do this.

368
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Look at me.

369
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
I can't help it if you say no.

370
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Roll it more.

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I can't help it.

372
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
How do you roll it?

373
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
This is wrong.

374
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
No, no.

375
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Stop it!

376
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
What's your problem?

377
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
There's a good thing here.

378
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
You two are going in here.

379
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
It's because of the explosion.

380
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
You can't do that.

381
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
No no no no no.

382
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
You're going to blow up.

383
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Stop it.

384
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Stop it now.

385
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,560
It's different from DX.

386
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
DX?

387
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm looking at DX a little bit.

388
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,560
It's getting really warm.

389
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
You can do it, right?

390
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
You can change it with your feelings.

391
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
You can do it, right?

392
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
We can change it.

393
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Yes.

394
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Then, you can change it.

395
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Thank you.

396
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm sorry again.

397
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Thank you.

398
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Oh my god!

399
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
You are so kind!

400
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
I can't believe it!

401
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,140
You nitwit!

402
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,480
DOUGHBUL!

403
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,280
Acting like a clown, sorry everyone

404
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,400
The M!PQUADcounty is from Asia

405
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,320
The YThese JiUamM öğ но is from Asia

406
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,980
répondbr Armor you can only see me

407
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,320
The M!PQUADcounty is from Asia

408
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,560
The YThese JiUammILLER is from Asia

409
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,240
get it?

410
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,480
As expected......

411
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
I love you, Mama.

412
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
There was something like that recently.

413
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
No, no, no.

414
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,480
When you do this kind of work, you often have to stop the passers-by in the location.

415
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Yes, yes.

416
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
But there is also the opposite.

417
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Can you stop them?

418
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Can you stop them?

419
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Tokyo has a lot of dramas, right?

420
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
I see.

421
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Do you have any special moments that you want to share with us?

422
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
I haven't had a normal life yet.

423
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Oh really?

424
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I've seen you doing it there.

425
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Like an AD.

426
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm sorry, I'm a little...

427
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,480
At that time, I was so angry that I even opened the Thai government.

428
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
What?

429
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
It had nothing to do with me.

430
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
No, no, it had nothing to do with you.

431
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
You were the one who was in the middle of it.

432
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
It had nothing to do with me.

433
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,480
It had nothing to do with me.

434
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,480
And the other day, I was a fool. I went to the Kinsa station and I was doing a location shoot.

435
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
I was doing my job, right?

436
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,480
And a woman from the A.D. told me to wait.

437
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
That was my second generation.

438
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
I told the car in front of me,

439
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

440
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,480
And then, the next one was this star, Matsumoto.

441
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,360
【Laughter】

442
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,200
He's just Hero tumbling down.

443
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,160
【Laughter】

444
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,720
It's down and you're just acting like an idiot.

445
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,000
You wanted to see the cz fields, right?

446
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,520
You wanted to see them and And finally they were used in the place in front.

447
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,680
The horns flew...

448
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,040
【Laughter】

449
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
So that's not the case with this guy.

450
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
You're talking nonsense.

451
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Yes, I'm the second generation.

452
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
You don't say anything to me.

453
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
You say sorry to the first generation.

454
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
You're an idiot.

455
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,040
When I get out of the car, I'm so excited.

456
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,040
I'm trying my best as a mother.

457
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,040
I'm in Tokyo now.

458
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I don't know what to do.

459
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Come on, come on.

460
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,540
I'm not angry.

461
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
Don't say that again!

462
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
I don't know!

463
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm writing it!

464
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,540
You're really angry!

465
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
You're calm.

466
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
I'm angry.

467
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Well, I tried my best to make you angry.

468
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm angry.

469
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
That's what makes you angry?

470
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
You're an idiot!

471
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,540
What's that?

472
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,040
Please say it!

473
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
You don't have anything to say?

474
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I didn't see anything!

475
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
You're a beast!

476
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I was waiting for you before, right?

477
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
I was, right?

478
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I was waiting for you.

479
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,540
Yes.

480
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,040
I was just there, at the car that was waiting for me.

481
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,040
There was a boy there.

482
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Like a ambulance.

483
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
I see.

484
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,040
No, no, no, don't stop, go!

485
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Stop!

486
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Stop!

487
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,040
This is a bad situation!

488
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,040
I can't watch this!

489
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
I thought you were the head of the village, but you're acting like a dead man!

490
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,040
I don't understand what you're saying!

491
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,040
That's because my mother is in Tokyo!

492
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
I don't remember!

493
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:37,040
I was tickling you in the country, but in Tokyo I'm going to tickle you. I'm going to erase you.

494
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I don't know.

495
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I'm going to tickle you.

496
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Well, well, I understand.

497
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Please be careful about that.

498
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't get sick of it.

499
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
When I get angry.

500
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:54,040
I don't see dogs or anything like that.

501
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I don't really watch things like that.

502
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
That's interesting.

503
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm not saying it's interesting.

504
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
I don't watch it.

505
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
What's interesting?

506
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
I'm not saying it's interesting.

507
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,040
You're trying to make me watch it, right?

508
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Even with a hamster, you can do something like this, right?

509
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
What?

510
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
I know, I know.

511
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I don't really watch those.

512
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I watch more of the ones that are on the corner.

513
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
That's also...

514
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
This is...

515
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Mom, I...

516
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
I can't read the lines.

517
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,040
It's the moment, now!

518
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
That's the end.
