1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukaya, Chiki-chiki!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Even if you buy it, it's hell! Even if you donate it, it's hell!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Totsugi! Kojo-bashi Grand Prix!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, Mr. Matsumoto.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, yes, yes.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today, you changed your thinking a bit.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, every time, this Kojo-bashi Club was announced.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
About 20 minutes later, that stage was already over.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I think it was about 20 minutes.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That fast?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We will never challenge such a thing again.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is it a complete withdrawal?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, it's a complete withdrawal.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Last time, the Gaki members played against the Kusukurizurizu, led by Yuichi Kimura, as Kojo-baffalos.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Kojo-bashi Club was attacked by the Kusukurizurizu.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Both teams had a great match, without a single step.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In the midst of a fierce battle, the Gaki team also won.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And this time, with a new way of thinking, we will send you a scary Kojo-bashi project.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's us. What is it this time?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to see other talents' Kojo-bashas.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I see.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to see that pitiful appearance.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A fool's face.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to see a refreshing face.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I see.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a bit of a surprise today, but we have invited various guests.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This time, we will have a Kojo-bashi match, as we did before.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
By inviting guests?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's the plan.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The other team will have a match against us.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The main purpose of this time is to have a Kojo-bashi match with our staff.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Kojo-bashas.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We haven't prepared well.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's right.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Suddenly, Kojo-bashas will attack us.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Kojo-bashi-man.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is it.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is going to be tough.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This time, the rule is that if you can endure the Kojo-bashi for 2 minutes, you will get 100,000 yen.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
100,000 yen.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's tough.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But if you want to give up, we will ask you a question.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a question that you definitely don't want to answer.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you can answer it, we will release you.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I see.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But if you don't want to answer it, you have to endure it.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I see.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
May I?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Today's orchestra is very strong.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's like a band.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Everyone, the target this time is...

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Who is it?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's this person.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a member of Kojo-bashas.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It looks interesting.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's very interesting.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I like Shu-san in this program.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's quite...

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's someone like Shu-san.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The one who pushes?

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How many times do I have to tell you that there's someone like Shu-san?

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This program is brought to you by the five sponsors.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The target this time is the young Uenzu Eiji.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And Girls.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And the veteran group Shu Tomitaku.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The four stars of Nishikino Akira.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
First of all, this member is going to compete with us.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I see.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm nervous.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nishikino-san is scary.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I wonder what's going to happen.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's always standing close to me.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The four countries are waiting for the show without knowing anything.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Good morning.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Good morning.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Good morning.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Please take a picture of us at the venue.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Please take a picture of us.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
After this, they will realize it with their own eyes.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The ultimate Kocobashi hell that suddenly attacks.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Kocobashi target.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
First of all, Uenzu Eiji.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How far will Earth's idol face collapse?

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Uenzu-san will enter.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Please check the set.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This time, I have a question for Uen.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What is the most memorable food of a celebrity?

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is...

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is...

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
As a celebrity...

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is...

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is a good question.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is Yuta and Otora.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is Yuta and Otora.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is a good question.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is a good question.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is a good question.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Uen-san, please show us your teeth.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Masuda-san is a momoe-chan.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is a good question.

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please answer it.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sure each of us has...

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, I'm sure each of us has...

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But I thought momoe-chan's teeth were normal, right?

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They were not normal.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can tell.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll give you an idea, so just answer and give up.

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The winner will get a total of 200,000 yen.

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's the content.

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What is the content?

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's okay.

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's okay?

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, thank you.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's almost time.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Almost time.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's continue.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
One more, one more

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you can do it in 2 minutes, you'll get 100,000 yen

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
100,000 yen, 100,000 yen

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you can do it in 2 minutes, you'll get 100,000 yen

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can't do it?

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll ask you a question

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you answer it, I'll release you

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll release you

139
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have a question

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Who is the celebrity you calleше thirty in a row?

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll release you if you answer

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
if you answer, release me

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who is the celebrity you calleше thirty in a row?

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Asshole

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Who is that?

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Who is?

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Who is the celebrity you calleше thirty in a row?

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I hate it

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll release you

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Barz

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Who is that?

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Who is it?

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Who is it?

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I want to be an idol.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Who is it?

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Who is it?

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Who is it?

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Who is it?

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have a runny nose.

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The end.

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's over.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I see.

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's amazing.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You said you wanted to be an idol.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You said it.

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's amazing.

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But it was long.

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How long did it take?

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It was 400,000 yen in 40 seconds.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hasegawa Kyoko-san.

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You said it.

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You said it.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You said it.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You said it.

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, that's true.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, that's true.

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I haven't heard a proper comment yet.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I was surprised.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is the end.

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is the end.

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you for your hard work.

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The end.

183
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you for your hard work.

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you for your hard work.

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Please go home.

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I think there are still some leftovers at home.

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Give up time.

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
1 minute and 13 seconds.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The idol WENZU's side dish was Hasegawa Kyoko.

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
WENZU, did you calm down?

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What is it?

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Really.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I thought it was over.

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I couldn't take it anymore.

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's been a long time.

197
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I suddenly remembered my childhood.

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's been a long time.

199
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's been a long time.

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's been a long time.

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Who will be the next target.

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Who will be the next target.

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The next target is a girl group with a cute character.

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The next target is a girl group with a cute character.

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
UGLY GIRLS

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Tanaka and Yamane.

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Are these two cute even if they are criticized?

208
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Are these two cute even if they are criticized?

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Are these two cute even if they are criticized?

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
UGLY GIRLS

211
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We're coming in.

212
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The first one.

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It'll be big.

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is a big one.

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a bit scary.

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The one who is more unpleasant is 88 years old.

217
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The one who is more unpleasant is 88 years old.

218
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is something...

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:37,820
Stand in the middle, and then, like a

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The two of them are,

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Tanaka's most sensitive sexual intercourse.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If he's not allowed to do it, he's a man.

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is a real man.

224
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is a real man.

225
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is a real man.

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is a real man.

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is a real man.

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is a real man.

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is a real man.

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is hard, isn't it?

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've never thought about it like this before.

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you wanted to forgive me, that's impossible.

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I would like you to stand up and get the prize.

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I would like you to stand up and get the prize.

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I would like you to stand up and get the prize.

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you.

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He's wearing the same T-shirt as me.

238
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's going to fight?

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Tanaka's turn.

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh no!

241
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Tanaka!

242
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
Tanaka!

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Tanaka!

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Tanaka!

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Tanaka!

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tanaka!

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Can he do it?

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He has 20 seconds left!

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
20 seconds!

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He has 20 seconds left!

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Tanaka!

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tanaka!

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Question...

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is the first thing you think of?

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The first thing...

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't!

257
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where are you?

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm having a hard time here!

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're in the video!

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What are you doing?

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm over here!

262
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Where are you?

263
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm over here!

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm having a hard time here!

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where are you?

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Where?

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Inside my butt.

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Time's up.

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What is this?

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What is this?

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Inside my butt.

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Inside your butt?

275
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Inside my butt.

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I've never heard of this.

277
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I've never heard of this.

278
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know the name of this.

279
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yamane start!

280
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Please, please.

281
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please, please.

282
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Can you do it?

283
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Can you do it?

284
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

285
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is really hard.

286
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is really hard.

287
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I wonder if I can do it.

288
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I wonder if I can do it.

289
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think I can do it.

290
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This guy is amazing.

291
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is really hard.

292
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is really hard.

293
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is really hard.

294
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is really hard.

295
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yamane, if you can't do it, please answer this question.

296
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Can a male entertainer forgive his body?

297
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not going to let you go.

298
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not going to let you go.

299
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not going to let you go.

300
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm not going to let you go.

301
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is really hard.

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm really not going to let you go.

303
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm not going to let you go.

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm going to say this.

305
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who?

306
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Fujii, I need you to fix this.

307
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What is this?

308
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What the hell is that?

309
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Fujii, fix it.

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What the hell is it?

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's over when you get there.

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Huh?

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's over.

314
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't want to do it!

315
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't want to do it!

316
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Give up time is 1 minute and 3 seconds.

317
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
An Girls' Tanaka's body was like a wall of ass.

318
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And Yamanen gave up in 1 minute and 1 second.

319
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The male entertainer who can forgive his body is Naohito Fujiki.

320
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Look, Yuta is still young.

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes, he is.

322
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He is still a junior.

323
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's right.

324
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He is still fresh when he is young.

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He is quite an old man.

326
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He has a bad feeling.

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know what to say.

328
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He has a bad feeling.

329
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He has a bad feeling.

330
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have never seen him like this.

331
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.

332
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The third target is the owner chef of Kanto Meisai.

333
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Shu Tobinoku.

334
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Nice to meet you.

335
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Please come in.

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Mr. Shu will come in.

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Nice to meet you.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is bad.

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is bad.

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He is wearing a hat.

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I will give you a tip while looking at the place.

342
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is a wall.

343
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is a wall.

344
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

345
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mr. Shu.

346
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you doing?

347
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Are you all right?

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What is Shu's favorite color of underwear?

349
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's right.

350
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is the same underwear.

351
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is the same underwear.

352
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When you stand up, the yellow-haired people will come and tickle you.

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Please be patient as much as you can.

354
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is there a scene?

355
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Please be patient as much as you can.

356
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will give you a tip while looking at the place.

357
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I will give you a tip while looking at the place.

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is a wall.

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is a wall.

360
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Are you all right?

361
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

362
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Please come in.

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Please come in.

364
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Start.

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Start.

366
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mr. Shu.

367
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. Shu.

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Mr. Shu.

369
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Mr. Shu.

370
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Mr. Shu.

371
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What?

372
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What?

373
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you all right?

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Seems like you are very well estàngly.

377
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you all right?

378
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What?

379
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And you?

380
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And you?

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Exactly, because of two minutes?

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And you?

383
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Exactly, because of two minutes?

384
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And you?

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes, thank you.

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Take it easy.

387
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

388
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

389
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why?

391
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you all right?

392
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Who cares?

393
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you.

394
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you for being patient.

395
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What's that?

396
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're really aman.

397
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I was nervous.

398
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I was nervous.

399
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,180
ONO!!

400
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,380
C'mon everyone!

401
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,780
The intermission is long!

402
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,440
Please wait a minute.

403
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,820
You have one minute left.

404
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
Please don't, don't ahead yet.

405
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,360
I got you, another 2 minutes.

406
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
It's okay do you want another 2 minutes??

407
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
Five-minutes...

408
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
You've got to be kidding me!

409
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Kojogashima is really hard

410
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
That's it?

411
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
You can do it

412
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
What is this?

413
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Ah, my hat

414
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
My hat

415
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
What is this?

416
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
My hat

417
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
His beard is coming out

418
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
My hat

419
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
My hat is coming out

420
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
I don't know

421
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
You can do it

422
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
You are really strong

423
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
You can do it

424
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
You can do it

425
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
You can do it

426
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
15 seconds left

427
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
15 seconds

428
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
You did it!

429
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
It's coming from here

430
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Thank you for the puzzle

431
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
That's right

432
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
You can say it

433
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
You can say it

434
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
You can say it

435
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
What should I do?

436
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
It's done

437
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
It's done

438
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
It's done

439
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Amazing

440
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
It's done

441
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
What is this?

442
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
It's not broken at all, Shiro-san

443
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
It feels good

444
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
It feels good?

445
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Really?

446
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Really?

447
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Really

448
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
It's amazing

449
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
It's amazing

450
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I thought it would be impossible

451
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
It's my first time

452
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Shiro-san

453
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
It's my first time

454
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
It's amazing

455
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
It's amazing

456
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
It's amazing

457
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Hello, Hana-chan

458
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
It's amazing

459
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
It's in

460
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
It's in

461
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Let's go with Sasaki-san's yakiniku

462
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
What?

463
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
What?

464
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
What is that?

465
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
What is that?

466
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
What is that?

467
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
What is that?

468
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
What is that?

469
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840
I can't tell

470
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,840
The fourth target is the star of 35 years of entertainment life

471
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
The star of the stars, Nishikino Akira

472
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Thank you

473
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
He appeared in his own judo machine

474
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
He is a star with a lot of energy

475
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Nishikino-san, please come in

476
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Thank you

477
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
A judo machine

478
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
What?

479
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
A judo machine

480
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
So

481
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You plan to fight

482
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
But

483
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Although it was mentioned earlier

484
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
But he isn't agile

485
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
That's right

486
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
You made up your mind

487
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
That's right

488
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
I really made up my mind

489
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
He made up his mind

490
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Well

491
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
One of the three Nishikinos

492
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Dear everyone

493
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Want to make a snack

494
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Do you have 3 Nishikino or not?

495
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Do you have it?

496
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,840
I want to see it, but I don't want to hear it.

497
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,840
He's doing the things that are coming out recently.

498
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
He's throwing it away.

499
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
He's throwing it away at this age.

500
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
The guitar is already naked.

501
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
What are you talking about?

502
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
It's completely naked.

503
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
This is amazing.

504
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,840
That's what I said.

505
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Start.

506
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Good morning.

507
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Good morning.

508
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Good morning.

509
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Good morning.

510
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,840
It's 100,000 yen in two minutes.

511
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
It's OK.

512
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
It's 100,000 yen in two minutes.

513
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,340
Say the name of the restaurant.

514
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
It's ***.

515
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
It's ***.

516
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
***.

517
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
What?

518
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
It's not a ***.

519
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
It's not a ***.

520
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
It's not a ***.

521
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,840
We're giving you a massage.

522
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
It's not a ***.

523
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
If you want to give up, here's a question.

524
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Who's the celebrity who had a side dish before?

525
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,340
I'm asking, sir.

526
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,340
Who's the celebrity who had a side dish before?

527
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
I'm asking, sir.

528
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,840
A celebrity.

529
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
It's a side dish.

530
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
It's a side dish.

531
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Does it feel good?

532
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Hey, come on!

533
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Why? Why?

534
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Why?

535
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Amazing!

536
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
It's a complete wind poison!

537
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Amazing!

538
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Amazing!

539
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
This picture is abnormal.

540
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
What is it?

541
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
The end!

542
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Amazing!

543
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
It's a complete wind poison!

544
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
It feels good!

545
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
What is it?

546
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm not good at taking pictures.

547
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
I see.

548
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
What is it?

549
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
What are you doing?

550
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Stop it! Stop it!

551
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Stop it! Stop it!

552
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Stop it! Stop it!

553
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Stop it! Stop it!

554
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Stop it!

555
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Stop it! Stop it!

556
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Stop it! Stop it!

557
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
You're going to be released.

558
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
You're going to be released.

559
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Who is it?

560
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Who is it?

561
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Who is it?

562
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
It's Mako Ishida!

563
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
It's Mako Ishida!

564
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
What?

565
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Is that how you did it?

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Amazing!

575
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
It's not about age.

I'm jealous.

601

The recording ended safely.

607
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Actually, Kochobashi was aiming for the last man to be the target of the day.

608
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
What is it? What is it?

609
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
What is it?

610
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
I was surprised.

What is it?

616
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Can I forgive you?

617
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
What?

618
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Who is it?

622
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
What?

623
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Can I forgive you?

624
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840

The man that Matsumoto can forgive is Yuji Oda.

Senpai, I'll do my best.

643
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Senpai! Senpai!
