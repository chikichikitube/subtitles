1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Five men gather at the windmill in the middle of the city.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The men's battle is about to begin.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here, in Yomiuri Land, it's about to begin.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Gakiwan Grand Prix

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We're going to be the fastest skaters in the world.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's right.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're going to be the fastest skaters in the world.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's introduce the machines.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's introduce them.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Here they are.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
These are the machines that have been chosen.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
These are the machines.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
First of all, the fastest machine will be chosen from these five.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Downtown will modify the machine and challenge the fastest country in the world.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is Ueda.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is amazing.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is how he looked like.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He has a nice body.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He has a nice body.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He has a nice body.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Show me your back.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Show me your back.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Show me your back.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's walking.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's walking.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's walking.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's walking like a bird.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The course is 41.5 meters long.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a high speed water slider on the old track.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's start with Tanaka.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's call him.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.1, Tanaka.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you ready?

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, I'm ready.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Start.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
6.36.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
6.36?

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is this a joke?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's wrong with him?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do it again.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ready.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Start.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He's fast.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's fast.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's fast.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's fast.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Look at this.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Look at this.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
4.79.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wow.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Start.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's fast.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He took it off.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
4.78.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
4.78.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ready.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Start.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You hit your elbow.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Did I?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Did I?

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did I?

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Do it again.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm really fast.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ready.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Start.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Am I too slow?

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wow.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wow.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Amazing.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
4.22.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hey.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
4.22.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My car is heavy.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Are you okay?

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm fine.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Look, there's a genius.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What are you doing?

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He's doing it.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's really doing it.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Start.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Amazing.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wow.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wow.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wow.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wow.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
New record.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
3.88.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ready.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Start.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
4.68.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
4.68.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I did it.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I did it.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think I'll go with Onuma.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think Tanaka can do it again.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why?

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why do I have to do it again?

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Onuma is challenging the record.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We'll make you the fastest machine in the world with our hands.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's a bonus.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your eyes are shining.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go with sparkling eyes.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hey.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're jealous.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll make you a machine with our hands.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm jealous.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you want to do it with me?

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No, I'm fine.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm fine today.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We've prepared something that you can think of.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's try it.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's right.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is what I want to see first.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What is it?

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to eat it.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm going to go to Harabayama.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll play the castella before that.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I want to eat this castella.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to eat it.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I want to eat it.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to eat it.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I want to eat it.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I want to eat it.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to eat it.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I like castella.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Isn't that great?

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The reaction has changed.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Castella.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's great.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm going.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Get ready.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Start.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Castella.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Castella.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Castella.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Castella.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Castella.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
4.60 seconds

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not good

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not good

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is this Jaguar?

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think this is good

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I want to try this

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I think this is good

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's Jaguar

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think this is good

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are the only special one

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll put this on my hand

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think this is good

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll put this on my leg

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't do this

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a big service

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Run

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Good luck

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's popular

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:18,000
5.01 seconds

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
5.01 seconds

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is that?

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's an elephant

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are late

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It looks good on you

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know if this is a TV

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It doesn't look good on you

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He is a fool

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ready

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Start

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't do this

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm panicking

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm panicking

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't see

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't do this

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I came here to buy cheese

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's go

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you talking about?

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm fast

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have little resistance

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Have you seen anyone doing this?

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have a jet engine

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Run

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What are you doing?

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've never seen anyone doing this

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is a great service

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Ready

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Start

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't do this

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm fast

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You were cool

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You came to help me

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ladies and gentlemen

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's starting

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are very energetic

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I heard that you were satisfied with the last episode

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The opening was long

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't need much today

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll do it quickly

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Time is running out

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why are you so energetic?

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't want to

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you think of downtown?

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Where are you going?

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know if you want to join

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's a very attractive place

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Where is it?

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you want to go, I can take you

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't want to go

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I want to know the place

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let's go

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You are an elementary school student

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm going on a school trip

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You said something good

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's the theme I'm aiming for

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go back to the past

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to go back to the past

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I want to go back

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can't go back

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to go back

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's the theme

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've been to Niigata, Hokkaido, Sendai

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I've been to many places

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I've been there, but it's safe

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's stop

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't like the dirty world

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you understand?

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Money and women

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's dirty

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I want to throw it all away

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't need it

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you have a beard?

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're an adult

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What do you have?

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I want to throw it all away

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I want to go back to my childhood

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You said that when you were in elementary school

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I want to go back to the inn

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's a good theme

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll buy you a pen

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll buy you a grave

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Is that okay?

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't you think it's okay?

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There's nothing to see

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think you'll enjoy it

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You want to go back to your childhood

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You have dirty eyes

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You have dirty eyes

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You have dirty eyes

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You have dirty eyes

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is going back to my childhood

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have a lot of dirty eyes

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Please go

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll refresh and come back

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How do you know that?

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why don't you call me Mattsun?

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Why?

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why don't you call me Mattsun?

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What?

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Old man

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Now?

271
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Old man

272
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You look like an old man

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You look different when you came back

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm different

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm like a rice with a heart

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't need rice with a heart this age

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have a heart

278
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But even if you have a rice with a heart

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a mess

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I want to go back to my childhood

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't want to look like an old man

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm an old man

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're an old man

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If you call me Mattsun

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If you call me Mattsun

286
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Mattsun

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mattsun

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Sorry

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you call me Mattsun

290
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll change everything

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You want to go back to your childhood

292
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I want to go back to my childhood

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You want to go back to your childhood

294
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know

295
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's different now

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's nostalgic

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There are always arguments between schools

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you remember the ferry in elementary school?

299
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There are many things

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We were on the ferry

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We were on the stairs

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We were talking

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We were elementary school students

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We bumped into an elementary school student

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I was talking and he kicked me

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I looked at him and he told me to move

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's scary

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I moved right away

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You didn't move

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's scary

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You didn't move

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I moved

313
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But I don't remember anything

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's not good

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't remember anything

316
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Matsumoto has a history of being raised by a mackerel

317
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He was separated from his mackerel

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Now he's looking for his mackerel

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What kind of separation did he have?

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't want to talk about that

321
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
How old was he?

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Stop it

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I won't stop it

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll leave it

325
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He was raised by a mackerel

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's true that he was raised by a mackerel

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's hard to change

328
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How long did he live in the mackerel?

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
From 8 to 10 years old

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He was very strict

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Did he beat you?

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He beat me

333
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Really?

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Really

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hmm

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You don't cry all the time

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No

338
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Why did you send me a letter?

339
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You don't have to send it

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's fine

341
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Matsumoto has met many cute guests

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Many people want to meet Matsumoto

343
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What would you do if you met a cute guest?

344
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's the same for everyone

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You don't want to be treated as a special guest

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's say you're a mackerel

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What do you hate the most?

348
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I hate that

349
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's the worst

350
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I won't shout

351
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I understand

352
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Even if you're a mackerel, you shouldn't be afraid

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You shouldn't say,

354
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't feel good

355
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't have time for that

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You shouldn't say,

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't feel good

358
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That will open up the heart of a mackerel

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Let's say I'm a fairy

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's say I'm a fairy

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like this

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Do fairies appear like that?

363
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There are many types of fairies

364
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't want to be treated like that

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I can't stand it

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't want to be treated like that

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why are you so happy?

368
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Peep-peep-boo?

369
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Peep-peep-boo?

370
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Peep-peep-boo?

371
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hello

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No

373
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You're an old man

374
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What are you doing?

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What are you doing?

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You're a bad fairy

377
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You always say,

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Peep-peep-boo

379
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You're a bad fairy

380
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Do it properly

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Why do you have that right?

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Do it properly

383
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're not cute at all

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Why don't you cry?

385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Why don't you cry?

386
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Do it

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't play a double role

388
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm a fairy and I met a man

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm a fool

390
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm embarrassed

391
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You know that

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm embarrassed

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Your face is not good

394
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Is that so?

395
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You should say hello

396
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't know how to smile

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're scary

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You don't like animals

399
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You should do it like this

400
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Do you understand?

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You should do it like this

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're a villain

403
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If you don't do that, he won't open his heart

404
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
For example, ghosts are the same

405
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ghosts are bad

406
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ghosts are bad

407
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ghosts are bad

408
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If you don't do that, he will be surprised

409
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He will be surprised

410
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He will be surprised

411
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm serious when I'm sleeping

412
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm serious when I'm sleeping

413
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm cold

414
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm cold

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm cold

416
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm cold

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm cold

418
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What do you think?

419
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Since you're wearing a kimono, I think it's cold.

420
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm not wearing a kimono.

421
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What did you say?

422
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What?

423
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What are you going to do?

424
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I didn't say anything.

425
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I want to use my butt hole.

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What are you talking about using your butt hole?

427
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's right.

428
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's right.

429
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Wait!

430
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What is it?

431
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey, let me do something too.

432
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Where are you going?

433
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Isn't it really delicious?

434
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Is it delicious?

435
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's right. Fireworks are always on my feet.

436
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's really delicious, isn't it?

437
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How about the three of us go together with that gesture?

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Are we connected?

440
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes, we are connected.

441
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's beautiful.

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
A man who is stronger and more beautiful than ever.

443
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That is a treasure bestowed by God.

444
