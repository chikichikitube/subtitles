1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I can't do it.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You don't have to force yourself.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I can't do it.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Gekidoujin Omae Sou Chanka Grand Prix!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is the 5th time.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Omae Sou Chanka Grand Prix.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You know what to do, right?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First, I'll introduce the guests.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today's guests are these people!

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait a minute.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why am I the only one here?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's wrong with you?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sit down!

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Guests! Guests!

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
When I introduce the guests, the people who don't like me spread out, right?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They don't like you!

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't hate you yet!

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There was a guest!

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Today, I'll write with you.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Really?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't write something light.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I won't write something light.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Something light is for graduation.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For what?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't write something that has a P in it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You have to write it with the intention of being praised.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's you!

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're the one who wrote it!

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're the one who put the mosaic here!

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The staff did it on their own.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's true!

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's true!

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're being too careful!

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have a different opinion.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
As usual, we have a guide interview.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When you reach 5 people, that person is the winner of the Grand Prix.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's get started!

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The first question is...

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This one!

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't you think you'll win the next election?

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't get cocky! You're a celebrity!

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You stupid!

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When you predict who will win the next election,

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
when you look at that person,

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you think, oh, that person is stupid.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You don't think that much.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't think that much.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Please write it down.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There was a person who said, welcome.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I was just about to write it down.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't get cocky!

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You stupid!

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Welcome!

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Did you write it down?

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I wrote it down.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then show it to us.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I wrote...

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's me.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Kimura Taro.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to hide it.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And?

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hikaru Genji's Moroboshi.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hey!

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't touch my head!

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Masudoe-san.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Tawara Soichiro.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Retsukushi-san.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Kume Hiroshi-san.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When I say something on the news,

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I feel like I want to do it myself.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Masudoe-san.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Takeshi-san.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Masudoe-san.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Giant and Baba.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In the world of politics,

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
there are 16 questions.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tawara Soichiro.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Tamaru Misuzu-san.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Kume Hiroshi-san.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
San-shi?

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you often say things like that?

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's Mach-chan.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Tamari-san.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Kume Hiroshi-san.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Takeshi-san.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Retsukushi-san.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Masudoe-san.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Kume-san?

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Kume Hiroshi-san.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So I'm going to teach you the answer.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Kume Hiroshi-san.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Kume-san, followed by Masudoe-san,

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Takeshi-san, Tawara-san,

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Retsukushi-san, Tamari-san.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Masudoe-san.

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The next question is this.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're not a waki.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You have a cute face,

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
but you stink!

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A female talent?

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't be on TV, you idiot!

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's the person.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please write it down.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I wonder if it's the same person.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't say it like I'm an idiot.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Then, without it...

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't want everyone to know.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not like I have a boyfriend.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you serious?

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't say things like that!

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's the costume.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The costume is the problem.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What should I do?

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You didn't know?

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't know at all.

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Really?

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The costume is the problem.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please write it down.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I didn't know at all.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You didn't know?

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're not a waki.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't like it.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've already spent my talent life.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay.

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you okay?

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll write it down.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's just talk about this part.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not good to write a letter somewhere.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, Amada-san.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Here.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is a rumor, isn't it?

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is...

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And this.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I was going to do this with you.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can't wear this costume anymore.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The costume you're throwing away.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, I see.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm just asking the general public.

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't have to give me the right answer.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How about this?

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The general public doesn't know that.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No one thinks I'm wearing a costume.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Muroi Shigen-san.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yoshisamoto.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Wada Akiko.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Wada Akiko.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I feel like it's hard to catch up.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Chiharu.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Matsumoto Akiko.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sugimoto Aya-san.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hisamoto.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's Hisamoto.

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It might be rude, but it's Hisamoto.

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hosokawa Fumie.

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hosokawa Fumie-san.

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Takao Kazaki-san.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hosokawa Fumie.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She's fat.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Asano Yuko-kun.

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sugimoto Aya.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sugimoto Aya.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hosokawa Fumie.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hosokawa Fumie.

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The general public thinks it's Hosokawa Fumie.

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The general public thinks that big women have a lot of armpits.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Really?

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think it's different from Sumo.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's different from Sumo.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think it's pretty common.

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think it's more like Chiharu.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The next question is this.

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You!

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're not funny at all!

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Stop it!

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Stop it!

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Stop it already!

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Stop it already!

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm begging you!

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Stop adding things.

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Just leave it as it is.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please write it down.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, no, no, no.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I want to write it down.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There are a lot of armpits.

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But there aren't many people who have armpits right now.

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Of course, that's definitely right.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But, you know, if you take this out and put a mosaic on it,

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think this will probably be number one, so you'll get a bang, bang, bang.

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Then what's the effect of the mosaic?

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No, that's why I put a mosaic on the picture that comes out here.

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You put a mosaic on that, too?

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then what is this corner?

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, this opening is something that only the people who are wearing it can enjoy.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then you don't have to do anything like this.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then what is this guest?

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Am I the only one who can enjoy this?

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's necessary!

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right.

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Then this.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Take a clap!

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Then I...

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll give it to you.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wait a minute, that clap!

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you know what kind of effect that clap will have later?

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It might be me.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm Tomizu.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Jimmy Onishi.

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
U-chan, Nan-chan.

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Downtown.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It would be interesting if it was individual, but it's not very interesting to get together and make a fuss at Uchihoneta.

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Takeshi.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Jimmy-chan.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yamada Masato-san.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Downtown.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't like being funny and making fun of others.

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Shibashi Takahashi.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Shigura Ken.

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ao Nien.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Jimmy Onishi.

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sendamizu.

237
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Sendamizu is boring.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Everyone only talks about it.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yamada Masato-san.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hon-jama.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm Jimmy Onishi.

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
O-Ni-Chan Cup Grand Prix!

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You are correct!

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You are correct, O-Ni-Chan!

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's your first time, right?

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes, it's my first time.

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is too much!

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's your first time, right?

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, it's my first time.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You should have done more.

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Congratulations.

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Congratulations.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank goodness.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I really wanted one until I got one.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But when I got one, it wasn't this cruel.

256
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Are you tired?

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm really tired.

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How have you been lately?

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey, I haven't seen that.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The Swiss guy.

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He looks pretty cool.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why?

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

265
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's impossible.

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard it.

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I heard that you were in the second round.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was slow.

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was filling water in a waterfall or something.

270
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't do that slowly!

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you doing?

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know about the world.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The maximum number of views you have is 27.

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You haven't seen it, right?

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The number of views I have is 27.5%.

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's enough.

277
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can't do it anymore.

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's too much.

279
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If you do that, your punishment game will be better.

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The general public's evaluation will be higher.

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why?

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It will be better than my Hato.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It will be better than my Color Bar.

284
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can't watch my show.

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You can watch it if you want to.

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What are you talking about?

287
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What?

288
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You are kind.

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You are annoying.

290
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You are kind.

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Are you trying to appeal yourself?

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why would I do that?

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You are kind.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't call me kind.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No one is kind.

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The voice of the general public is like this.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The voice of the general public is like this.

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have done so much so far.

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If you lose, you should go on a foreign trip.

300
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You have been sitting in the dressing room for 12 hours.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It was so hard.

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It was like this before.

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's why I hate going on a foreign trip.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You may be fine.

305
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But I have 190 years of experience.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
How many years do you have?

307
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why is it so fun?

308
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There were only old ladies on the tour.

309
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The manager was sitting behind me.

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He was smoking.

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When I did this, the old lady behind me was like this.

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't want to go.

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why do you hate going on a foreign trip?

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I have been sitting in the dressing room for 12 hours.

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There were only old ladies on the tour.

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I had to put up with it.

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It would have been cool if you had gone on a foreign trip for a long time.

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You had to put up with it.

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't you think it's cool to go on a foreign trip?

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't know what the old lady would have done to her daughter.

321
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The old lady went to the bathroom.

322
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She didn't go out for a long time.

323
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't want to go on a foreign trip.

324
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's a talent.

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay to go on a foreign trip and hear the sound of poop.

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What is the sound of poop?

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's the sound of poop.

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's the sound of poop.

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You don't have to listen to it.

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm happy to hear that.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Why are you happy?

332
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There is no sound like that.

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's okay not to listen to it.

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
After I went on a foreign trip, I gave her a lot of applause.

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
When I went on a foreign trip, I was waiting for her.

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I hated it.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
After that, I went in immediately.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was waiting for her.

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
After I went on a foreign trip, I went in immediately.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Wait a minute.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Do you understand the situation?

343
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where did you go?

344
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I went to the bathroom.

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You have a big dream.

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can't stand it if I'm told that I pooped.

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't stand it if I'm told that I pooped.

348
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I can't stand it if I'm told that I pooped.

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You...

350
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You...

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Stop the upper cut.

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you care about the people around you, you should stop being angry.

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can't do that.

354
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I've never been angry.

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm telling you. I've never been angry.

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's not true.

357
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What's not true?

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You should leave it alone.

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I found out why people get angry.

360
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
First of all, if you get angry, you shout out loud.

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you shout out loud, you can't stop it.

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You shout out louder and louder so that you don't lose to that shout.

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You shout out louder and louder so that you don't lose to that shout.

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you shout out loud, you can't stop it.

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I see.

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But you've been doing it for a long time.

367
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You shout out loud and shout out loud.

368
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Ask the people around you. Which one is angry and which one is scared?

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No. I'm doing my job.

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're holding a wire and a megaphone.

371
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's not true.

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No one thinks you're scared by that.

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No. You're doing it because you're scared.

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's the impression I have.

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You should leave it alone.

376
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's with that face?

377
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You shout out loud everywhere.

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What are you looking for when you get soup at the airport?

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It doesn't matter.

380
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's minestrone.

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It doesn't matter how hot it is.

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It doesn't matter what kind of soup it is.

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't even say it's tonjiru.

384
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's hot.

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's minestrone.

386
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's your way of saying it.

387
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a candy.

388
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's a lot of candy.

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's like a pirate ship's handle.

390
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's like a pirate ship's handle.

391
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's like a pirate ship's handle.

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It doesn't matter how hot it is.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It might be true.

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you get it?

395
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It might be true.

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Be patient.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If it sounds like that.

398
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What are you doing?

399
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Where are you going?

400
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's the difference between me and you.

401
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You don't shout out loud.

402
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You don't shout out loud.

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't get it.

404
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you mean by loud?

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What do you mean by loud?

406
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You don't shout out loud.

407
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What do you mean by loud?

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't get it.

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't get it.

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What does it mean?

415
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Are you doing it?

416
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't think so.

417
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't think so.

418
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

419
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't get it.

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't get it.

421
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't get it.

423
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't get it.

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't get it.

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

428
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't get it.

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't get it.

430
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't get it.

431
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't get it.

433
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When a bus passes by, what does it mean for a driver to wave his hand?

434
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't get it.

435
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't get it.

436
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't get it.

437
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't get it.

438
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm not going to the bottom today.

439
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There are a lot of eggshells on the flower pot. What does it mean?

440
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The ingredients of the shell are different from the flower pot.

441
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're thinking too much.

442
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why are you thinking so much?

443
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You!

444
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't get it.

445
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There are eggshells on the flower pot.

446
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They were born.

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No, no, no.

448
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They were born.

449
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, well, wait.

450
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay, I got it.

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's getting interesting.

452
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Come on.

453
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

454
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The eggshells are broken.

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
They are.

456
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
They were born.

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They were born. That's why there are eggshells.

458
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What about the contents?

459
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The contents are gone.

460
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They are gone?

461
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They are gone?

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
They are gone.

463
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They won't break.

464
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
They won't break.

465
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They are gone.

466
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What does it mean?

467
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know.

468
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Are they living?

469
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They are living.

470
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Don't you know?

471
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I know.

472
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
How do you know they are living?

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I've never seen them.

474
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The eggshells are close to the eggshells.

475
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Good morning.

476
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Good morning.

477
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Thank you for today.

478
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's over.

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The eggshells protect the living things.

480
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They are broken.

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They are broken and fallen.

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
After the living things are born.

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't know what they are.

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The living things are gone.

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
They are born and run away.

487
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I see.

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think you can see them in the morning.

489
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Maybe at 4 or 4.30.

490
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know the time.

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You should have seen them at least once.

492
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm not interested in them.

493
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I know what they are.

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Open the door at 4.30 or 3.30 and see the eggshells.
