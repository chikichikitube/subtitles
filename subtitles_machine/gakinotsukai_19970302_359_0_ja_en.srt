1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the 1st episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Chiki-chiki!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go round and round with the 1st episode!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've made something great.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right. We've spent a lot of money today.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today, we're going to use this table to play with everyone.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's what we're doing.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, it's always like that.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From the center of the table, we're going to show our faces.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're going to make people laugh just by looking at our faces.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you don't come out, everyone will be sitting at the table.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For example, if this guy does it, I'll never laugh.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If he says that, we'll just have to make a big deal out of it.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I see, I see.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's a game between the person who comes out and you guys.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In a way, it's the parents who come out.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I thought about it.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought it would be fun and fun at that time.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But when I think about it at home, we can't win.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What do you mean?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's a waste of talent.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, we've shown a lot of things so far.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sure the viewers are familiar with it.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, look around here.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, this is no good.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is no good, but that and this can't win.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The backbone is different.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yoshinobu is better than this.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's usually terrible.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is a middle school art teacher.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's no good.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And that.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's not good, is it?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Did you just eat it?

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Did you just eat it?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's no good.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm eating something that's going to hit me.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's no good.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The strongest character in the program has been entered.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's 30 minutes before the game.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who will be able to take a laugh with their own face?

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It seems that each person is not interested in checking the story.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The other person is just a laughing stock.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
His expression is also serious.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The first episode.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
First of all, Mr. Yamazaki.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I understand.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm a professional, so I want to do it well.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do it well?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do it well?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I want to do it well.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please do your best.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Everyone.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll just tell you the rules.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course, people will come out.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please be careful.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't look down.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Look carefully.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please look at the face carefully.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is it okay?

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Um.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Can I laugh like this?

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can laugh like this.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a little bit.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's a little bit.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's a little bit.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's my rule.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm the rule.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
First of all, Mr. Yamazaki.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Everyone, please start.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm confident in Yamazaki.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll say 2500.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What about you, Soga-chan?

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll say 1000.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
1000.

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For the time being.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I might laugh at the system.

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I see.

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll say 1000, too.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
1000.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll say 500.

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
500?

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What about you, Suzuki?

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
1000.

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
1000.

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
1000.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
2000.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll say 2000, too.

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I won't laugh.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You won't laugh.

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've never laughed at something like that.

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Everyone, please get ready.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ready.

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Start.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wait a minute.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's say goodbye.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's say goodbye.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wait a minute.

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Finished.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait a minute.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait a minute.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is there anyone who can't laugh at something like this?

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
My judgment.

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone laughed except for Endo.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Everyone laughed except for Endo.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll say 600.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I won't laugh.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yamazaki-san.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I won a lot of money.

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's different.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's different.

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's really different.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I really want to say it.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Look at this person's eyes.

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't help but look at it.

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't help but look at it.

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right?

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Look at this.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Look at this.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's really good.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Amazing.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This seat was lost, right?

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's lost.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
First of all, it was taken from Kotobu.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's understandable.

148
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I looked at it a lot.

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is hard.

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The second person.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is Sugachan.

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Everyone, please come in.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's amazing.

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will bring more and more.

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's amazing.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have to buy it.

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
5 beds.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yamazaki-san, 5,000 yen.

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Next door, 2,000 yen.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes.

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
1,000 yen.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
1,000 yen.

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
500 yen.

166
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
500 yen?

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have a lot of money.

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I see.

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Next door, 500 yen.

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a lot of money.

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
1,000 yen.

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
One more time.

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No, anyway, Sugachan is really bad.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's no good.

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
However, it's never gonna change.

178
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't�� like.

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's never gonna end.

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Man.

181
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Please pay for it.

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's go.

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Prepareed.

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Stop!

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Stop!

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's over!

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're so cowardly!

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're so cowardly!

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're so cowardly!

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Everyone is out!

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Sugacchan, you're amazing!

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Thank you!

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yamazaki, you're like a geisha!

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why is it me?

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now, it's the third person.

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey, Otaku.

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You look pretty depressed.

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's probably Sugacchan right now.

199
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're amazing.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yamazaki-san, don't regret it.

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You were laughing so suddenly.

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I didn't think you'd laugh out loud.

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Right?

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's because you have it.

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is the end of the tweets.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please come back.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go!

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If it's gone, I'll make you pay.

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ready!

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Start!

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go!

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yamazaki, lower your hand.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yamazaki, lower your hand.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's over!

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's over!

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Next is Kogoriko Tanaka!

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll pay.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Here's 5,000 yen.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When I was your age, I didn't get paid.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You cut your tongue with a cutter.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Triangle.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Please come back.

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
1,000, 2,000, 2,000, 2,000, 2,000, 2,000.

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
400 yen.

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
400 yen?

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is it 400 yen?

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Please be more careful.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a power level.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ready!

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Look in the middle.

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Ready!

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Start!

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, my love, my darling, I'm hungry for your touch along lonely time.

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm hungry for your touch along lonely time.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm hungry for your touch along lonely time.

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's over!

238
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Next is Yoshinobu Yamazaki Matsumoto!

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You're fast.

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's funny just by looking at the coat.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's a thin coat, isn't it?

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Mine is long-sleeved.

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait a minute.

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't tell.

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Everyone put up with it.

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm still laughing.

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What are you laughing at?

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Kawabata-san, your partner is broken.

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's really noisy.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you laughing at me?

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's noisy.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sit down!

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Producer Nakamura is always impressed by his unique sense of fashion.

255
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What kind of face will he show us?

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's go!

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Ready!

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Start!

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yoshinobu Yamazaki Matsumoto

260
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yoshinobu Yamazaki Matsumoto

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yoshinobu Yamazaki Matsumoto

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's over!

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Everyone except Yoshinobu Yamazaki Matsumoto is out!

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's amazing.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's about 3500 yen per month.

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
3500 yen per month?

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's not true.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I was taken to a different world.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Where did you go?

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That was...

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
An adventure.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That was...

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Where did you come from?

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I was taken to a foreign country.

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Next, Matsumoto-san.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes.

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Go ahead.

278
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Put one cushion here.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can do it yourself.

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's right.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can put two cushions.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll do that.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If you continue like this, you'll probably lose.

284
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's true.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Right?

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Everyone, please think about it and put it on.

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go ahead!

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There are three of us including Matsumoto-san.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's about time.

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is huge.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's huge.

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Will Matsumoto be able to do it?

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's either way.

295
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's go. Get ready.

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ready...

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Start!

298
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I should have done it a little more.

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Sugai-chan, Yamasaki, Tanaka!

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Only you can do it!

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're the most annoying, Matsumoto-san.

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The super sub-sub-human, the writer, Suzuki.

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Will he be able to laugh?

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't think I'll be able to laugh either.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's so funny.

306
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's not funny at all.

307
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't study as much as a fool.

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't do it.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know if it has anything to do with it.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Suzuki, it's hard to wait this long.

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's right.

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's waiting so long.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How long is he waiting?

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why is he tightening his neck?

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's your turn.

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yamasaki-san, how many points did you get?

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I got 10,000 points.

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
10,000?

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sugai-chan got 17,000 points.

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
17,000?

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
How about you, Murasaki?

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
5,500.

323
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
5,500.

324
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How about you, Yoshinobu?

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
6,000.

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
6,000?

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How about you, Tanaka?

328
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I got 2,700 points.

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
1,000 points?

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How about you?

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I got 9,400 points.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I got 9,400 points.

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I got 2,000 points.

334
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Furthermore, I got 20,000 points.

335
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
20,000?

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's amazing.

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's amazing.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't laugh.

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I won't laugh.

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I won't laugh.

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not going to laugh like this.

342
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not going to laugh.

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Halfway.

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Halfway.

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Time's up.

346
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes!

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes!

348
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's not funny at all.

349
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He's really depressed.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes!

351
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's not funny at all.

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He's really depressed.

353
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He's really depressed.

354
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's really depressed.

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He's really depressed.

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He's really depressed.

357
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's really depressed.

358
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The last one.

359
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Komurasaki.

360
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes.

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And you, Suzuki.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You have minus 42,600 points.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I did it.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's the last one.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Please come in.

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You have 10,000 points.

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
10,000.

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Matsumoto has 24,000 points.

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's right.

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
24,300 points.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
34,300 points.

372
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How many points do you have?

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How about you, Takahashi?

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I only have 24,000 points.

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
24,000.

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How about you, Enmiro?

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
8,800 points.

378
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
8,800.

379
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
How about you, Tanaka?

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
5,500 points.

381
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
All of them?

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
9,000 points.

384
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
9,000.

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
How about you, Suzuki?

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I only have 53,000 points.

387
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
53,000.

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How about you, Kaede?

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I only have 53,000 points.

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
How many points do you have?

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I have a lot of points.

392
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This is the last one.

393
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Get ready.

394
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Look at the center.

395
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes.

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The last one.

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't do it, Suzuki.

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why?

399
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't do it, Suzuki.

400
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why?

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You should have done it like this.

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You should have laughed at that, Suzuki.

404
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You should have laughed at that, Suzuki.

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is...

406
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Komonosaki, right?

407
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

408
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This is not good.

409
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This is impossible.

410
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It suits you too well.

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is not good.

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can't see your poverty.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Suzuki, you have minus 95,000 points.

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Komonosaki has plus 68,200 points.

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You should have said something.

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Please.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm laughing.

418
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You're laughing.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Basically, the words you speak are from Katakana.

420
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You should have said something.

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Actually...

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yes.

423
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I was thinking about something else.

424
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You could have done it again.

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What should I do?

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What if everyone laughed?

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What if even one person laughed?

428
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What if even one person laughed?

429
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
95,600 points.

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is a disadvantageous situation.

431
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You made a bad atmosphere.

432
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I didn't make a bad atmosphere.

433
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Everyone is in the same situation.

434
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's a disadvantageous situation.

435
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Komonosaki, please go somewhere.

436
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Please go somewhere.

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Please catch a fly and come here.

438
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's go.

439
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Get ready.

440
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Look at the center.

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Stop clapping.

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm doing anything.

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Let's go.

444
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm doing anything.

445
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm doing anything.

446
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm doing anything.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Why are you laughing?

448
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Where are you laughing?

449
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:20,000
