1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, it's time for the last episode of Showa

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's the 7th episode of World's Fair!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's the 7th episode?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Are you still going to do it?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We haven't gotten married yet

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We don't have to do anything

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When was the last episode?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
2 and a half years ago

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It was Jaguar Yokota

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He was beaten to a pulp

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I thought I could do it

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Heisei's Oliver-kun

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the first episode of World's Fair!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's the first episode of World's Fair!

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's the first episode of World's Fair!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's the first episode of World's Fair!

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Will Heisei be able to get married this time?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today's star is Heisei!

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where's Heisei?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Heisei!

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't treat me like a fool

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's the 7th episode

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I want to do it again and again and get married

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please decide today

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I heard you have a plan

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Actually, I have one

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I want to sing and dance in front of everyone

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to get married

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're biting the bullet

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's fine

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Singing and dancing!

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've been good at it

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm from the disco generation

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I go to the disco every day

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If I can do it

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How old are you?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How old are you?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm 48

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
48?

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I want to get married before I'm 50

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You've never been married?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're still single?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm single

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're single?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You want to get married?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've been married twice

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But at the end...

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's a lie

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's a lie

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's welcome the first girl

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please come in

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good evening

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're so young

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is it better to be young?

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I like young people

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Miyabi Kamisaki is 23 years old

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
She's always bright and beautiful

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She's beautiful

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you know Heipo?

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've only seen her on TV

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What do you think of Heipo on TV?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She's an interesting person

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She's not interesting

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
She's funny

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was surprised when I saw her

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She's like soft vinyl

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She's my favorite talent

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you want to go to an amusement park?

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't like rides

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have a height limit

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you like haunted houses?

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to go to Fushikura Island

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Please take over

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think it's possible

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There are many things

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Please welcome Heipo

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What is this?

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What is this strange distance?

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What is your first impression?

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She's cuter than I thought

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's a good impression

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Please talk to each other

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Please talk to each other

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a waste to talk to Heipo

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's a waste

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can call her your daughter

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She's 48 years old and 23 years old

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She has a cute voice

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Nice to meet you

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm Heipo

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are 23 years old

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm 48 years old

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you like older people?

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When I think about marriage, I like strong people

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You are strong

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why have you been alone all this time?

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are like a fortune teller

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm a cheap fortune teller

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are your hobbies?

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I like dancing

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't understand this

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have a big dream

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What is your dream?

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That is

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She has a strange voice

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not good at singing

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Heipo is 50 years old and still alone

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Heipo likes women and is afraid of ghosts

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Her son is 20 years old

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Her husband is married

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She is still alone

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She is making a lot of money

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She gives her husband all the money

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If she misses this chance

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She will be in trouble

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's the end

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Heipo, go Heipo

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Get married

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's the end

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That was great

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That was great

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The dancers were great

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It was disgusting

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That was great

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That was a good kick

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Heipo did his best for his girlfriend

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's right

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's see

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's see

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's see

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why?

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why?

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He doesn't like ghosts?

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He is afraid of them

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't think I can rely on him

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Heipo failed

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He did a good job

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He danced well

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was great

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I didn't feel anything

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was surprised

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't feel anything

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's have one more person

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It was strange when he said the first person

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's have a girl

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Nice to meet you

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She is 24 years old

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She is beautiful

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You know Heipo, right?

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, I watch it on TV

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What do you think?

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She is funny and I like her

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's not funny

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are mistaken

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's have Heipo

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What is this distance?

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What do you think?

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's strange

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think it's good

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Nice to meet you

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How old are you?

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am 24 years old

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you OK?

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I hope we can have fun together

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's fun to go on a trip together

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I haven't been there recently

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I go to Paris every year

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Really?

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I like to spend New Year's Day in Paris

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I haven't been to Europe

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's go to Venice

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go to Venice

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's nice

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's nice, isn't it?

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's nice, isn't it?

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's over

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You look like you are having a hard time

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I often get a massage

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I am good at massage

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's try

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I am good at it

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why do you play a monkey once?

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I want to touch it

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's warm

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's nice

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How do you think of a man who is good at massage?

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's nice

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You go to Paris and get a massage

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You go to Paris and get a massage

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I like to go on a date

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to go shopping

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you like brand stores?

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, I buy a lot of things

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I live next to Roppongi Hills

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Really?

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will give you a present

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I am happy

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What do you like?

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I like money

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You opened a beauty salon this year

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't like beauty salons

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't like beauty salons

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you go there often?

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't like it

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Are you happy?

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't like it

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You have a good reaction

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you want to go out with me?

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I am a little nervous now

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't hate it, do you?

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I want to talk to you

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I will invite you to the Hills

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I want to cook

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you cook?

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can cook anything

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What kind of food do you like?

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I like...

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I like...

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I like...

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You have become so small

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You did it seriously for the first time

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is fun

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You are moving

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What is this subtle feeling?

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is it over?

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You did a good job this time

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Did you watch the show?

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was good

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It is better to listen to the half of the story

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's judge

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is good

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why?

239
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What is the reason?

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You are smaller than I thought

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because of the size

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You thought it was big

243
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You shouldn't say that

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Heipo failed again

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can go home

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's not over yet

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I have something to think about

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I want you to help me

249
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can't do it alone

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I want you to do a musical with me

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If you do it with me, the girl will fall

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I have something to think about

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It doesn't make sense if you fall because of me

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you fall, it's mine

255
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What?

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What are you talking about?

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Please take a look

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I will start

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oz's magician

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You do this?

261
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't do it

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You can do it

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I have already decided

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Please take a look

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The main character is Doroshi

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is Heipo

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is the most prominent role

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
By the way, Mr. Hamada Kakashi

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Mr. Hamada is similar

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Mr. Matsumoto Burikiga

272
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Mr. Yamachan is the lion

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Mr. Yamachan is good at lions

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is the first time

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I thought you were good at it

276
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The witch is Tanaka

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Witch?

278
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes, I want Tanaka to do this

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is the end

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's random

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm confused

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This member will go to defeat the witch

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It will be like this

284
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Tanaka will be defeated

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Heipo will be defeated

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It will be a happy ending

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It will be like this

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's okay

289
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Please do it

290
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Heipo's life depends on Oz's magician

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
First, read the script

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Mr. Heipo

293
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It says to bring the witch to the pond

294
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Will you fall into the pond?

295
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I have a pond

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You have to do it

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I have to go into the pond?

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's annoying

300
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's annoying

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Why?

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know

303
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you get wet in the water, you'll be in trouble

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Take good care of it

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Next, the dancers

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They learn the choreography

307
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Mr. Hamada

308
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mr. Kakashi

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm dancing

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm the best

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not that movement

312
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's not that movement

313
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's not that movement

314
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's coming

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The witch is coming

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Please

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There is no monkey

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We are here to defeat you

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't laugh if you defeat the witch

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's weird

321
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's like this

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's harder than I thought

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's hard

324
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll practice

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll call the teacher

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mr. Hamada, please do it

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why am I the only one who says it?

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The practice begins

329
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
In order to get the happiness of marriage

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He has been practicing for more than 20 years

331
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He is teaching the magic of Oz to the five artists

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Hamada, please do it

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm doing it

334
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm doing it

335
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's weird

336
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's like this

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What should I do?

338
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not that I slipped

339
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not that

340
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yama-san, you said it clearly

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes, I said it clearly

342
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's do it

343
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is it okay?

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's okay

345
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It will be decided

346
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's the happy ending of the flower

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The happy ending of the flower

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm happy

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Please come out

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Sakura-san is a glamorous beauty with a cute smile

351
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Who is the type with economic power?

352
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm a student

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I want to get married as soon as I graduate

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Heiko-san has a lot of economic power

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll go to the student

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The student is okay

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The student is okay

358
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What do you want to ask?

359
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What is the most expensive gift you have ever given to a woman?

360
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I like women's necklaces

361
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I gave about 500,000 yen to two or three women

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's amazing

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes

364
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What do you do on your days off?

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't go out much on my days off

366
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Then

367
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Come to my house

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I've lived here for 10 years

369
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't do anything

370
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You really don't do anything?

371
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't worry

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Even if I do something

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You will do it

374
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll take responsibility

375
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Please meet my parents

376
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Suddenly?

377
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let's start with friends

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Let's go to defeat the evil witch

379
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I am the witch of the west country

380
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Do you want to give me something?

381
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We came to defeat you

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't make me laugh if you defeat the witch

383
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
How about that? Be prepared

384
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Come on

385
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You can't defeat me

386
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Are you okay?

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Leave it to me

388
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What can you do to a little girl like that?

389
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I know your weakness is water

390
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll throw you and your daughter into the pond

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It hurts

392
00:22:41,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Please marry me

393
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Please marry me

394
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's fast

395
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Why?

396
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's better to be a little more modest

397
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's too much

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Heipo failed

399
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It was cold

400
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's go home

401
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Please do it again

402
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What are you doing?

403
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
How about me?

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Let's go home

405
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's go home

406
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's over
