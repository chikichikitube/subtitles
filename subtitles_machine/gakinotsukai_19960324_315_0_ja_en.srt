1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's amazing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're looking for a house in Yamanaki, aren't you?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You want to live in a house that's one rank higher than yours, right?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, I do. I live right next to it.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But if you guys decide, I'll live there.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Really?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Really.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is it okay for me to live in a house that's one rank higher than yours?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's totally fine.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's totally fine?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's totally fine.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I might get pranked.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You might get pranked.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I won't come to your house anymore.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I know you're an amateur.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you get caught, you'll be in trouble.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
An amateur doesn't have to be in trouble.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's cold, isn't it?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The camera isn't rolling.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wait a minute!

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I wonder if I can live in a house like that.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I thought you were looking for a house.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But you're a talent.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You have to live in a house that's one rank higher than yours.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You have to live in a house that's one rank higher than yours.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You have to live in a house that's one rank higher than yours.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Stop it.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I won't do anything.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's a weird way to get involved.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's hard.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's wrong?

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I feel sorry for my partner.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wait a minute.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can't leave so soon.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can't leave so soon.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can't leave so soon.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was about to get excited.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I thought I had to leave soon.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What are you talking about?

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is hard, too.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's not hard.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's okay.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's talk a little more.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm scared.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you scared of?

50
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I thought I had to leave soon.

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Please look for a house.

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I found two or three houses.

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you.

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's pretty cheap around here.

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really?

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There's a cheap place like a lie.

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think I'll push this place for now.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Really?

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's really big.

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It says to lower the price.

61
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go.

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This place?

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

65
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go here first.

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's 135,000 yen.

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's around here.

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's nice, isn't it?

70
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But it looks noisy.

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, no.

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's noisy.

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, no.

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not running anymore.

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not running anymore.

78
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's running.

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's running.

80
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bus.

81
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's wrong with him?

82
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He's crazy.

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, this is it.

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's nice, isn't it?

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
M house.

86
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
M house.

87
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's an auto lock.

88
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Really?

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

90
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Really?

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You don't have to push the button.

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can go up the stairs.

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What?

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can go up the stairs.

95
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You can go up the stairs.

96
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, no.

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can't go up the stairs.

98
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You don't need an auto lock.

99
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't need an auto lock.

100
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's okay.

101
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's okay.

102
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I've been looking for it for a long time.

103
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's okay.

104
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's okay.

105
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's okay.

106
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can go either way.

107
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can go either way.

108
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You mean I can go from here?

109
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

110
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This way, this way.

111
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, come on.

112
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please come in.

113
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not like you're in a restaurant.

114
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's like you're at a hotel.

115
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's nice isn't it?

116
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's nice.

117
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This.

118
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I like the interior.

119
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I like this white one.

120
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

121
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's spacious.

122
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's spacious.

123
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The kitchen is good too.

124
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's nice.

125
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's a kitchen too.

126
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

127
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

128
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What does it do?

129
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is it 1DK?

130
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's 1DK, right?

131
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Is it 1DK?

132
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, it's not.

133
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's over here.

134
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Really?

135
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's 2DK.

136
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's 2DK.

137
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's 135,000 yen.

138
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Will it catch fire?

139
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The building before this will be gone.

140
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Really?

141
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There's a waterfall here.

142
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Really?

143
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really?

144
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's noisy.

145
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The scenery is nice, but it's noisy.

146
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's okay.

147
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's okay.

148
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay.

149
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a mountain, isn't it?

150
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's put it here.

151
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We can finish shooting.

152
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What do you think?

153
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I like it.

154
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's enough to be this big.

155
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

156
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll decide.

157
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ouch!

158
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What happened?

159
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Someone broke it.

160
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's here.

161
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I just broke it.

162
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I heard it again.

163
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you talking about?

164
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's here.

165
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's here.

166
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't break it.

167
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's here.

168
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was strangled.

169
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's here.

170
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are you talking about?

171
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What did you do?

172
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What are you talking about?

173
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's here.

174
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It hurts.

175
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you doing?

176
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It hurts.

177
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I get it.

178
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What is it?

179
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm in the room.

180
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you crying?

181
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't want to.

182
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It hurts.

183
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You scared me.

184
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I get it.

185
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's go.

186
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It hurts.

187
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's go to the next one.

188
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ouch!

189
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is there a way to say no?

190
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's mean.

191
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a ghost.

192
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What is it?

193
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a ghost.

194
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a bad guy.

195
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's the same as the one who lived before.

196
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's the same as the one who lived before.

197
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's the same as the one who lived before.

198
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's true.

199
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The same as the one who lived before.

200
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's why it hurts.

201
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a bad guy.

202
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go to the next one.

203
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's here.

204
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's here.

205
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
106,000 yen.

206
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
106,000 yen?

207
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's here.

208
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's here.

209
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's here.

210
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a bit old.

211
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're a fool.

212
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's heavy.

213
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The inside is the problem.

214
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The inside is the problem.

215
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It was crying.

216
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's unnatural.

217
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was crying.

218
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The door is open.

219
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's here.

220
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It came out from there.

221
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It came out while crying.

222
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you understand?

223
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I came here to see the room.

224
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's too high.

225
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's too high.

226
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's sad.

227
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's an amateur's room.

228
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's an amateur's room.

229
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's beautiful.

230
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's beautiful.

231
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's real.

232
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There's a room.

233
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's a room.

234
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Can I take a look?

235
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's 106,000 yen.

236
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's cheaper than before.

237
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's cheaper than before.

238
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is the entrance to the other room.

239
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is the entrance to the other room.

240
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There should be a big TV here.

241
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There should be a big TV here.

242
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's popular now.

243
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's popular now.

244
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's like a TV.

245
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I see.

246
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Young people don't like to show off.

247
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Young people don't like to show off.

248
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's better to show off at the entertainment world.

249
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's better to show off at the entertainment world.

250
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the toilet.

251
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is the toilet.

252
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a marble.

253
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's a marble.

254
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's real.

255
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The toilet is a little plain.

256
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a little plain.

257
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's a stone here.

258
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What is this?

259
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What is this?

260
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is this?

261
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hey!

262
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hey!

263
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I see it.

264
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I saw a flower.

265
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:18,980
It's not a

266
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
What is it?

267
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
What is it?

268
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
What is it?

269
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
What are you doing?

270
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
What are you doing?

271
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
What are you doing?

272
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
What are you doing?

273
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
What are you doing?

274
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
What are you doing?

275
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
What are you doing?

276
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Ladies and gentlemen

277
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Ah, that's right

278
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
I wanted to see the provocation

279
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
It's amazing

280
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,980
The person next to me is like a predator

281
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
The person next to me is like a predator

282
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
But Ryoma

283
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Come here

284
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,980
No, really

285
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
What should I do?

286
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
It's been a long time

287
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
It's been a long time

288
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
It's been a long time

289
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,980
This program is really

290
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,400
There are some

291
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,980
There are some

292
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
There are some

293
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
It's not decided yet

294
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
I'm sorry

295
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
I want to do it

296
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
There are times like that

297
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
There are times like that

298
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
I was in a music fair

299
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
I was in a music fair

300
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
I was wearing it

301
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I was wearing it

302
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,980
I don't know

303
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,980
I don't know

304
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
It's getting cold

305
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
It's getting cold

306
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,980
It's getting cold

307
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,980
It's cold

308
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,980
It's cold

309
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
It's cold

310
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Ah, I

311
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Ah, I

312
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
I don't know if you noticed

313
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
I don't know if you noticed

314
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
It's been a long time

315
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
It's been a long time

316
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
This guy

317
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
It's personal

318
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
It's personal

319
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
You probably

320
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
You probably didn't notice

321
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
You were watching TV

322
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
You were watching TV

323
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
You know?

324
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
Please tell me

325
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
It really has been a long time

326
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
It really has been a long time

327
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Seriously, I was angry

328
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
I couldn't do anything

329
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
I'm working hard

330
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
He's not a guest or anything.

331
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,980
I don't know if he came from the next studio or something,

332
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,980
but he's waving his hand between the camera and the camera.

333
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Because you're working hard here.

334
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,980
It has nothing to do with you.

335
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,980
You can go to the studio and wave your hand from behind.

336
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,980
I don't know who you're waving it to, but it's a problem if you get waved.

337
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Yeah.

338
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
You can't wave your hand during the show.

339
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
That's right.

340
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
You can't wave your hand.

341
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,980
You have to wave your hand for about 5 minutes.

342
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
I can't do that.

343
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
You can't do that.

344
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,980
I was doing this on the way.

345
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,980
How many times? Wait a minute.

346
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Go somewhere.

347
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,980
No, I said it first because I said it came out.

348
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,980
It's just that the pig is big, isn't it?

349
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,980
That's right. That's what I'm saying.

350
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
That's weird.

351
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
No, it's not.

352
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
It's not.

353
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
It's not?

354
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,980
It's big. It's big.

355
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,980
It's pretty fat.

356
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,980
If it's a pig, it's big.

357
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Don't say that.

358
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,980
How many times have you said that pigs are big?

359
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,980
You're really good at saying that.

360
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:20,980
If you die, you're definitely going to know that at the end.

361
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Well, let's say goodbye to Hama-chan's VTR at the end.

362
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,980
If it's a pig, it's big.

363
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,980
The roll is flowing.

364
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
That's really funny.

365
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,980
I want you to do that.

366
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,980
They have a different sense of value.

367
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,980
When I look at something, I look at it with a sense of beauty.

368
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
They're different.

369
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,980
I can't hold it in.

370
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
This is going to hurt.

371
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,980
This is going to hurt.

372
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
This is pretty good.

373
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,980
It's been a long time since I've been angry.

374
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,980
It's been a long time since I've been angry.

375
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,980
Recently, I haven't been angry with a pig like this.

376
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Really.

377
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,980
In that sense, it's a waste of material.

378
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,980
That's right.

379
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Now.

380
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,980
There's a thread on it.

381
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,980
I see.

382
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,980
I sometimes go to the video store.

383
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Do you want me to verify it?

384
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,980
I don't know if I can call it a verification.

385
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,980
In the video store's adult section.

386
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Who's going to borrow it?

387
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
There's an AV.

388
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Can you take a look at this?

389
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm surprised.

390
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
No.

391
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,980
Usually, the AV has a beautiful package.

392
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,980
If you actually look at it, you'll be surprised.

393
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,980
In that sense, I won't leave it to you.

394
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Wait a minute.

395
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,980
You're looking at it, aren't you?

396
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,980
I'm not looking at the inside.

397
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,980
I'm not looking at the inside.

398
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
You're saying you're not going to leave it to me.

399
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,980
It's like you're actually looking at it.

400
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
No.

401
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
It's a little unsatisfactory.

402
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
There's mosaic in it, right?

403
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
It's not good if there's no mosaic in it.

404
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,980
You can't put mosaic on everything.

405
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,980
You can't put mosaic on everything until the end.

406
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
What about here?

407
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Put it here.

408
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,980
Put it here.

409
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,980
I looked at the counter.

410
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Really.

411
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,980
The tea fell down.

412
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
It's my house.

413
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,980
It's a video house.

414
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,980
What is this?

415
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Really.

416
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,980
What is this?

417
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,980
I went to the video house once.

418
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
I went back again.

419
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
You wanted to see it again.

420
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
You wanted to see it again.

421
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,980
I went to the video house again.

422
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
No.

423
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
I want to see it again.

424
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,980
This is...

425
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
Let's go.

426
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Itao was there, too.

427
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Itao said, there's no way it's like this.

428
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,980
He said, this is the director.

429
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,980
Why did the director put it in the package?

430
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,980
It has nothing to do with it.

431
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,980
It's a series.

432
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Two out of the six series.

433
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,980
I can't even guess.

434
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
There's a montage.

435
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,980
There's a four-part montage.

436
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,980
There's obviously a lot of it.

437
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,980
There's a lot of it.

438
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
There's an eye.

439
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
There's a head.

440
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
There's an eye.

441
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
There's a tooth.

442
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
There's a mouth.

443
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
This is a montage.

444
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
There's a head.

445
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
There's an eye.

446
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
There's a tooth.

447
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
There's something.

448
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,980
And then there's the mouth.

449
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,980
There's something skin-colored.

450
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
There's something like that.

451
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
And then there's the mouth.

452
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
No one's going to borrow that.

453
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
It's not even in their hands.

454
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
You've seen it, haven't you?

455
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
I was really surprised.

456
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,980
I don't know how to look at it.

457
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,980
How do you do that?

458
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,980
You can't tell which is the front.

459
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,980
That's too much.

460
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,980
Let's take a look at that.

461
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
No, I can't.

462
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Let's borrow that and look at it.

463
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
All of us?

464
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Yeah.

465
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Maybe I'll just look at it and it'll be on TV.

466
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,980
But if you do something like that, this program is stupid, so I'll call you.

467
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Someday I'll take you to the dentist.

468
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,980
I don't know what to do with that.

469
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,980
If the two people I'm talking about come at once...

470
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
It's going to be like this.

471
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,980
No, I mean, I can't put those two together.

472
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Well, it's the same thing here and here.

473
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,980
I think the neck is more valuable.

474
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,980
It's too far.

475
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Let's take a look at it.

476
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
I want to see it.

477
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm really surprised.

478
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,980
What kind of nonsense is that?

479
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,980
For example, for example...

480
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,980
It's like he's eating insects.

481
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
It's like he's eating insects.

482
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Hey, don't you have any insects?

483
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,980
It's a woman who seems to say that.

484
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
I see.

485
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Do you understand?

486
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,980
If you look at it, it's like a kingdom.

487
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,980
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has been training for a thousand days at that koa store.

488
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,980
There are various difficulties for humans to live, but what is the most painful thing in this world?

489
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
What do you think it is?

490
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
It's hard.

491
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Well, there's a lot of hard things.

492
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,980
There's a lot.

493
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,980
It's not a light theme that can be explained.

494
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:25,980
I agree.

495
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Why are you laughing now?

496
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,980
I don't think it's hard, but if you go through it, it's hard.

497
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
If you make various choices...

498
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
It's a small-scale law.

499
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I wonder what it is.

500
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,980
It's surprisingly attached to life.

501
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:52,980
For example, when I'm really hungry and I have a lot of time today, I don't have a bridge.

502
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,980
That's too small.

503
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,980
What are you going to do today? I'm really hungry. It looks really good.

504
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Run to the convenience store.

505
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,980
You're really...

506
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
I'm going to get angry.

507
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,980
You're the one who's getting angry.

508
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
If you say that, it's all the same.

509
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,980
For the time being, it's hard not to run when there's no bridge.

510
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
It was like a manga.

511
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,980
100,000 yen, 50,000 yen, I can't see it.

512
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
This is the hardest.

513
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,980
What's 100,000 yen, 50,000 yen?

514
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
That's not it?

515
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Everyone doesn't pay attention to that.

516
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,980
Even if you say it's the hardest, what are you going to do because there's no bridge?

517
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,980
The poop is hard.

518
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,980
It's hard, but I'm going to be lazy.

519
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,980
I can't do anything about it today.

520
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,980
That's how hard it is.

521
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,980
When I was in elementary school, I was in pain.

522
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,980
When I took a break from school, I couldn't stand it when the dog ran away.

523
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,980
It hurts so much.

524
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Mr. Matsumoto, the dog is running away.

525
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,980
It hurts so much.

526
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
It hurts so much that I don't have the ability to think.

527
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
I was looking for it on the back of my hand.

528
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,980
I found it, but I don't have any blood.

529
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
You don't have a collar?

530
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,980
I don't have a collar, so I did it like this.

531
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:44,980
I don't have a collar, so I did it like this.

532
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,980
I don't have a collar, so I did it like this.

533
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,980
When I laugh and get angry, I'm a god.

534
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,980
When I drive, I have a stomachache.

535
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,980
It's hard.

536
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
I was really angry before.

537
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,980
I was really mad when I was in the car.

538
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,980
I was suffering because of a traffic jam.

539
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,980
I thought there might be a toilet somewhere.

540
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,980
I thought, but I can't stay put in public toilet, so I stayed in the bathroom.

541
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,980
I finally arrived at the public bathroom.

542
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,980
I opened the door and squat down.

543
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
I opened the door and squat down.

544
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm angry.

545
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
What are you doing?

546
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,980
What? Air?

547
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Like this?

548
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Huh?

549
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Nothing's coming out?

550
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
You did it with air, huh?

551
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Inside my stomach?

552
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,980
What is this for?

553
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
It's to stop it.

554
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,980
It's to stop it. I did my best.

555
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I didn't come to the public toilet to carry air.

556
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,980
When you get your graduation certificate, do you have any cool lines?

557
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,980
There's a lot of that.

558
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
The last line?

559
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
I often say, don't mess up the rest of the lines.

560
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,980
But isn't that something you get for graduation?

561
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Do you have any cool lines?

562
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
No, but you know how students usually say it?

563
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
And the principal says it, right?

564
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
And you get it like this, right?

565
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Yes, yes, yes.

566
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,980
And when you go like this, you get it right here.

567
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Normally you go like this.

568
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,980
That's what normal students do.

569
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,980
But that's the last of the three years.

570
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,980
When you go like this...

571
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,980
That was a great graduation ceremony!

572
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,980
That was a great graduation ceremony!
