1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm Miyasubako, the staff member of Kira-Kira, a TV show about gangsters.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's this?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, Miyasubako, you can say whatever you want to us.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I see. You've been on this show for a year and a half or two years.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There must be something you want to say.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can't say it out loud.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I see.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not going to say that I'm writing a name.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't know who wrote what.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are the type of people who accept such things from the very beginning.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, yes.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We admit mistakes.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, you seem to be proud of yourself.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So I think we can just say what we want to say.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, really?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, it's hard to say it.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, well, well.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is Miyasubako.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why are you so rude?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's this?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Isn't it something you can use?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, I see.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, I don't know what you're going to buy.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I see.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please put it in.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're going to put it in?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's see.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The second one, right?

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, the first one, the first one.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I wonder who this is.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hamada, you're not funny.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Five years later, the comedy show will be this Team Zero Yamazaki.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yamazaki!

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yamazaki, wait a minute!

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Do you know what Miyasubako means?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How do you write a name?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you really think so?

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, I'm being honest.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it true that it's five years later?

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, it's about five years later.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I see.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I think it's a good thing that young people think like this.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think it's a good thing.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I thought so, too.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought I was funny when I was young.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I had talent.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is from Matsumoto.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't call me Nakasone.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Remember my name.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's all.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, who am I?

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm that stylist, Chibiya.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come here.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What's your real name?

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm Uesugi.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't remember Uesugi.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What do you mean?

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Uesugi is a little strange.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I always remember that name.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why did you call me Matsumoto?

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, Noriyasu...

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He called you Hage?

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is he your father?

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't call me like this.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is he your father?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can't call me like this.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go back.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's this?

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In Okinawa, in Roppongi,

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I always bring delicious women.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Even if you give them to me once,

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I won't be punished.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When I gave you this paper,

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I wrote my name on the paper.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It says I don't know.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't want you to find out.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Really?

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I wrote my name here.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Come on, Otomo.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Otomo!

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Come on, Otomo.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What does this mean?

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, sometimes...

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sometimes I...

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I like women.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You like women?

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you like women?

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, I like them.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You don't like them?

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, I don't like them.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you think I like them too much?

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Somehow...

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Somehow...

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't give a shit!

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Why?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
To the director of Saito-Chief.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've been with you for 10 years,

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
but I've never seen your girlfriend even for a second.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
To be honest, if you don't have one, I don't have one.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is interesting.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wait a minute. Where is she?

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where? Where? Where?

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Probably...

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes?

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Maybe she's doing the opening ceremony next week.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes?

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think she's in the dressing room.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Saito!

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You!

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was listening to the assistant's phone number!

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't know there was such a team director!

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What the hell!

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Did you see his face?

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Did you see?

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I bet you couldn't take his face.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He looked so sad and depressed.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Saito, what were you doing?

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What did you ask?

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Look at this!

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You should have met her.

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You shouldn't have sat next to her.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You should have talked to her.

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You should have talked to her.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You should have talked to her.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This guy is the director.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you okay wearing such a skirt?

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know if I did it right.

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You were late today.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You should have talked to her.

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What were you doing before we started?

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What were you doing before we started?

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, I'm often told that I'm a nice guy.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was taking a shit.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You were told that you're a nice guy, but you were taking a shit.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You don't look like you're taking a shit.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Idiot!

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
By the way, you look like you're having a hard time.

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You look like you're having a hard time.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How many times did you take a shit?

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
As I always say, I take a shit about once a month.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I take a shit about five times a day.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I take a shit about two hamsters a month.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't have to take a shit about two hamsters.

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But today, I took a shit about two hamsters.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I took a shit about two hamsters.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You haven't finished yet.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You shouldn't do that.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's true.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I take a shit once a month, and then I don't take a shit about two hamsters.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's still the same.

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You still have something to say.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're right.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's what I've been saying.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's right.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Did you take a shit properly?

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes, I did.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can't take a shit about two hamsters.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I did take a shit about two hamsters.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you have poop on your pants?

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So, I have.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You should have pooped properly.

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Everyone has poop on their pants.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't have.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Everyone has.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What?

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Everyone has poop on their pants.

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I took the statistics.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
8 out of 10 people have poop on their pants.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't have.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't have.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't stand it.

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you mean you can't stand it?

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We can't stand it.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Out of 10 people, for example,

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
up to that point,

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
we put in 10 people.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
These two people.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
8 people already have poop on their pants.

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, you have.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have.

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't have.

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What do you mean?

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
up to that point,

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we put in 10 people.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You guys.

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No.

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're the only one who doesn't have poop on their pants.

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Aoi, why do you have poop on your pants?

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't think it's dirty.

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's not about whether it's dirty or not.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't have poop on your pants properly.

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
When I finished,

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
everyone was like,

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
did you wash your hands?

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't wash my hands even if I poop.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why?

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why?

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well,

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't do it when I'm small.

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't think I should wash my hands.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't wash my hands either.

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When I'm big,

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't wash my hands.

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Everyone, let's be honest.

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not a genius.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong?

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll ask you.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why don't you wash your hands even if you poop?

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why are your hands dirty?

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll poke you in the head.

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then I'll wash my hands.

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Then I'll wash my hands.

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I see.

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's great.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I went to the batting center.

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's great.

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I thought you were a real sportsman.

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The speed ball hit the batting center.

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The speed ball hit the batting center.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If I do more,

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll be called out in the draft.

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I quit because I thought I couldn't do it anymore.

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who's watching the batting center?

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's your job.

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you're going to bet,

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
quit golf and go to the batting center.

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's fine.

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No, no, no.

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I see.

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're good.

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're really good.

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I came to the summer camp to get a note.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's great.

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then I'll go to the batting center and bet.

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's do it.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're so strong.

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's fine.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's do it.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I go to the baseball class.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Only one day?

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, yes, yes.

255
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't have gloves.

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm poor at home.

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You went home because you were about to cry, didn't you?

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If you're going to learn baseball,

259
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
bring gloves.

260
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't have money.

261
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Everyone is wearing uniforms,

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
but you're wearing a jersey.

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's not true.

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm Matsumoto.

265
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Nice to meet you.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's get along.

267
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's start the summer camp.

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Matsumoto,

269
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
why don't you protect him from the outside world?

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Matsumoto, where are your gloves?

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't have gloves.

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Be quiet.

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't have gloves.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then, in my head,

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I remember my mother.

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

277
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My mother when I was a child.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
When I was a child, yes.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In my head,

281
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
when I went to Awajishima with my family,

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I said,

283
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I love you.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My mother is like this.

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When I think about running on the beach with my mother,

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
tears come out.

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You came back without saying anything.

288
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I came back without saying anything.

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You came back without saying anything.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why is that?

291
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
When I'm sad,

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't think there are many girls.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There are.

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
When I was practicing taikwondo,

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was doing something in my lower body.

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The gouda of taikwondo.

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was doing gouda.

298
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When I was in elementary school.

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I was doing something in my lower body.

301
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here.

302
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I was doing this.

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here.

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Where did you dig it?

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Where did you dig it?

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Stop it.

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you have something sad,

309
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
your mother runs like this.

310
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You were running when you were running away.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Your mother.

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why is your mother running when you are pooping?

313
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's scary.

314
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not scary.

315
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You don't do it.

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What?

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You don't do it.

318
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll do it.

319
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll do it.

320
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's about time to do something.

321
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This year.

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The first time.

323
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The first time.

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What kind of rule?

325
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's decide the rules.

326
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What kind of rule?

327
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What kind of rule?

328
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Nothing.

329
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's why it's a winning-losing rule.

330
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, that batting?

332
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes.

334
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What is it?

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, there is one more thing in the batting squad.

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Prepare a professional player.

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll have you throw it.

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll have you throw it.

339
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How many balls will you hit with 10 throws?

340
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, that's fine.

341
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's right.

342
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's better to have a different player.

343
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why?

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why?

345
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why?

346
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why?

347
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why?

348
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If it's the same player, it's not good.

349
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's better to have a different player.

350
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You should be a professional player.

351
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll be a match player.

352
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're underestimating me.

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm a professional player.

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm a professional player.

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're fast.

356
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm not fast.

357
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think so.

358
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm a professional player.

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm a professional player.

360
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's totally different.

361
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What are you thinking?

362
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A professional player?

363
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Of course.

364
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Ega.

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Sure.

366
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Isn't it?

367
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes.

368
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's not that bad.

369
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How many kilos does it throw?

370
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How many kilos does it throw?

371
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not that bad.

372
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
About 100 kilos.

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can't throw it as you want.

374
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's right.

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes.

376
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, you know, you know, you know.

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

378
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What is it?

379
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What is it?

380
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What is it?

381
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What?

382
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What?

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You don't have any HENKA-kyu?

384
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What is that?

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you don't get straight, curve and shoot in 10-kyu, what will you be?

386
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's...

387
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you throw only big, weird balls only in my time, what will you do?

388
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In your time, straight, boom...

389
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So, you can decide how many-kyu each.

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
How many-kyu for HENKA-kyu.

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's right.

392
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, is that so?

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

394
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is that so?

395
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No, no, no.

396
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you throw big, weird balls only in my time, what will you be?

397
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What is that?

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

399
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What is that?

400
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's for curve.

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, let's do it.

402
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
In the near future.

403
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, in the near future?

404
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Then, let's play a punishment game.

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I see.

406
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's do it.

407
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What kind of punishment game?

408
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What?

409
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Then, let's go to a human-like place.

410
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let's do it.

411
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You said you don't want to do it in the past, so let's stop it.

412
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll replace this tooth and this tooth.

413
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why do you have to replace this tooth?

414
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey, why do you have to pull out the tooth in the punishment game?

415
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll give you my tooth.

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't need it.

417
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't need it.

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't need it either.

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You have teeth, but I don't have teeth.

420
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't need it.

421
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What are you talking about?

422
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, you can think about it gradually.

423
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What?

424
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Gradually.

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I see.

426
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll do it.

427
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The game will be decided by that.

428
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then, you can think about what to do.

429
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The game will be decided by that, right?

430
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

431
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You said it.

432
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why?

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You have a strange confidence.

434
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't have confidence.

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You have confidence that you can beat me in sports.

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What?

437
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Did you just say yes?

438
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes.

439
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I see.

440
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you think you can beat me in sports?

441
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You said it.

442
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You underestimated me.

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You should play a game instead of batting.

444
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't say nice things.

445
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What?

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't say nice things.

447
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Your team and my team.

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But you have to match with 8 players.

449
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There are 16 players.

450
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't care.

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Do you think so?

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

453
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's interesting.

454
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you think so?

455
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What?

456
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't care about the game.

457
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If I lose, I can do it alone.

458
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But if there is something that the whole team can do,

459
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
we can accept the game.

460
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then, the whole team will be desperate.

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If I lose, they will think I'm kidding.

462
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The young people behind.

463
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Right?

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's do it together.

465
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
OK.

466
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let's do it.

467
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In a game.

468
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What if I lose?

469
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's not a problem.

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've always wanted to try it.

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you want to try it?

472
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Even if you ask me to try it,

473
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can't say yes.

474
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll do it with saran wrap.

475
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you want to try it?

476
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you lose,

477
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
don't tell the players.

478
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Idiot.

479
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Idiot.

480
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I can't do that.

481
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What will happen if you try it?

482
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What if there is a big electronic game?

483
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's like heating meat.

484
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's like Sinatto.

485
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My body is...

486
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Stop it.

487
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Let's do it.

488
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Good evening.

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You have long legs.

490
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't have long legs.

491
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're still the same.

492
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's your name?

493
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm Emiko Tanada.

494
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
How old are you?

495
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm 19 years old.

496
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
19 years old.

497
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Look at her.

498
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's me.

499
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Look.

500
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's you.

501
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's amazing.

502
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You have long legs.

503
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't have long legs.

504
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You're right.

505
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you have long legs?

506
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't have long legs.

507
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What's wrong with you?

508
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think you're drunk.

509
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Thank you very much.

510
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you very much.

511
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's amazing.

512
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
At the end of last year, Naoko Nozawa appeared on a radio program.

513
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They talked about downtown.

514
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Nozawa said,

515
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hama-chan, you look like Fumiya sometimes.

516
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He was happy.

517
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Listen.

518
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Fumiya said,

519
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think I look like him.

520
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He said something very happy to Hama-chan.

521
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
How was it?

522
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hama-chan was happy.

523
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What's that voice?

524
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I think I look like him.

525
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Really?

526
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You really look like him.

527
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I feel sorry for him.

528
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
When he wears a hat like this,

529
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
he really looks like him.

530
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So,

531
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
when Fumiya-san asks him what he looks like,

532
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Nozawa-san said,

533
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He looks like a lolicon.

534
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He said,

535
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He looks like a middle school student.

536
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A lolicon or a lolicon?

537
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Which one do you like?

538
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I like both.

539
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I like boys who are in the second grade of elementary school.

540
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't say such a bad thing.

541
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't say such a bad thing.

542
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You don't believe in anything.

543
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't believe in anything.

544
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
How can you say that I look like a lolicon?

545
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Good evening.

546
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I also look like Hama-chan.

547
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Have you ever heard of me?

548
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
When I eat a sweet potato like Ritomazu Shikenshi,

549
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
it reacts immediately.

550
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I don't like it.

551
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You are the worst.

552
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
When I write something like this,

553
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I get angry again.

554
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I get angry again.

555
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Who made you laugh?

556
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Are you sick?

557
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You are the worst.

558
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
My friend called me a lolicon.

559
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Just like that?

560
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I think so.

561
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But I get angry again.

562
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So I put a whistle on my butt.

563
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A lolicon?

564
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Good evening.

565
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's play baseball.

566
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

567
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I didn't intend to do that at all.

568
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I just wanted to say that I'm good at baseball.

569
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's what happened.

570
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But it's okay.

571
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not funny.

572
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's do it.

573
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So next week,

574
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
let's play a draft.

575
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Let's decide who will play with whom.

576
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
This is a big game.

577
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's decide who will play with whom.

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The losing team will be punished.

579
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So everyone watching TV,

580
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
let's think about a punishment game that 9 people can do.

581
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a big game.

582
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Please refer to it.

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm angry.

584
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm 20 years old.

585
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll tear his face off.

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
50 thousand yen.

587
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And a button.

588
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That was a fart.

589
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's great.

590
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Anyway, please send it.

591
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And the assistant.

592
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The mother.

593
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
All the assistants.

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They're here.

595
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's it.

596
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We're going to play a draft game.

597
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
See you next week.

598
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
