1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm Dantan's child care worker.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Don't be silly.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
T-t-that's enough.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Naniwa Kijji

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Quite solid!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What will you do if it goes like this?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's OK.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Really?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is also gunpowder, right?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's OK.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Good.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How is it?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There are quite a few.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All of these are gunpowder.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was lucky to succeed the other day.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How much gunpowder do you want?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't need much.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't need much.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The outside is like this.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll do it somehow.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There are quite a few.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think there are three times more than the other day.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know if it's dangerous.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was practicing to get out of the rope yesterday, but I don't know if I can do it.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you ready?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm ready.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My hands are tied.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's dangerous.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it painful?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, it's OK.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Can you do it?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can do it.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll do it.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can't move, can you?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can't.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you do this much.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't do it.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can't?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't do it anyway.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's hard to move.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you OK?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If I tie my legs, I can't move at all.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can you do it?

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll do it if it's three times.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, it's OK.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I have no choice but to do it.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The key.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The key.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you OK?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The key is locked.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's go.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's dangerous.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You should leave.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
OK.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's go.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's go.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's dangerous.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It looks big.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This one?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's go.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I got it.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I got it.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I got it.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's dangerous.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Can't you get out?

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's dangerous.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's too dangerous.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll go and check.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hurry up.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hurry up.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's dangerous.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's too dangerous.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll go and check.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey!

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's moving.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you OK?

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you OK?

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The key is...

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm hungry.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was hot.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It was hot.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Eating hot food makes you hungry.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's what I think.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It was hot.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But I did well.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's moving.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can do it again.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hurry up.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Everyone is fine, right?

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are you saying?

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The audience is fine, but the people on the stage are not.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I have insomnia.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why?

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I have a lot of worries.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What worries?

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have a lot of things to think about.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really?

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Everyone calls me Machan.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But I'm Matsumote.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So everyone calls me Machan.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If I'm Kato, I'm Kato-chan.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
When I think about it, I can't sleep.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Kato-chan is Kato-chan.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So you're calling me Kato-chan.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Even if that's the case...

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't think that's natural.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're living in that world.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm always full rotation.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm full rotation, but I'm out of charge.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is that so?

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sometimes I'm really into it and I think it's amazing.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But sometimes I'm not.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But sometimes I'm out of charge and I don't care.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In the middle of the night, I'm driving.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm doing construction work.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
At about 2 or 3 o'clock, 10 or 20 people gather and dig a hole.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't ask anyone to do this construction work.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If I do it as a hobby, what should I do?

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Old men gather and say,

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's do it again.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The people who met yesterday dug a hole.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If I'm doing it, I think it's terrible.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sometimes I'm not.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sometimes I'm out of charge and I think it's amazing.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If I'm doing it as a hobby, what should I do?

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're out of charge.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're out of charge again.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not my body. It's strange.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why?

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't care.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's here.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This wrinkle is strange.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's not wrinkle.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's not wrinkle.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's the skin, isn't it?

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's sticking. It's impossible.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's impossible.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When I did it, I wanted to do it beautifully.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But I'm doing it because I'm doing it.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If I do it normally, I won't do it.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's frustrating.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's strange here.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's strange.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If it falls, take it.

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I didn't think about it, but I thought about it in my room.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can just cut yours. We have enough of this.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What is Komura Gairi?

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If you stretch it like this, it will be like this, right?

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If you think you can do it, you can do it, right?

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Komura Gairi? No, I've never been Komura Gairi.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It hurts. The line between the fingers is like this.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Your shoulder is also bad, right?

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I've never been Komura Gairi.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I see.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is your father big?

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My husband is big.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He's short.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why do you want to be Komura Gairi?

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If your eyes get tired, your head will hurt, right?

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If my eyes get tired, my head will hurt.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't want to be Komura Gairi.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What about you?

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What about you?

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why are you touching me?

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why are you touching me softly?

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You have a strong head when you were a kid.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Have you ever been hit by a car?

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No.

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You have, right?

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But I've never been hit by a car.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was hit by a car.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I was hit by a car.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I was crying.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was crying.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you OK?

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm not OK.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I said, it's ok.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then he ran away.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What a scary man.

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
When we were going to the place,

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the guy who was waiting for us was shaking his head.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, I see.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I thought he was shaking his head,

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and I thought it would be fine if I went behind him.

208
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I went behind him and he was like,

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
BOOM!

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He was shaking his head like this.

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
BOOM!

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then he fell down.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It was 30 seconds later.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
BOOM!

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I said, it's ok.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then he was like,

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
BOOM!

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What a scary man.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The worst thing that happened to me was,

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the brake was stuck here.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The brake was stuck here?

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
At the bottom of the bicycle.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The brake was stuck here,

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and I got out of the bicycle.

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I ran around the corner,

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and a bicycle came.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There was a big bicycle

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that was on a rice field.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The old man came,

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and I hit him.

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
BOOM!

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I said,

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm here.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then he fell down.

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was terrible.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I said, it's ok.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It was so heavy.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was so heavy.

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It was like this.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I said,

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it's ok.

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I got out of the bicycle.

244
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I was like,

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
BOOM!

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm an idiot.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well,

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I heard that

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Nessie was found.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You saw the newspaper together, right?

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes.

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What? You don't know?

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't know?

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You are so stupid.

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You are so stupid.

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You remember all the bad things.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You remember all the bad things.

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know that if you poop,

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you have to clean it.

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Everyone knows that.

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I know that.

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you know that?

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I know that.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You were pooping.

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You were pooping.

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not a shogun.

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm not a shogun.

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I know that.

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I know that.

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You are so stupid.

272
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you think about it,

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
there are other stupid things.

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There are other stupid things.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Since a long time ago?

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've seen Nekomuzume.

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Really?

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hey, hey, hey.

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I've told you many times.

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I've seen Nekomuzume.

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Where did you see it?

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When?

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
When I was in the 11th grade.

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
When?

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Near my house.

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Near your house?

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Near my house.

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
With whom?

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
With Nekomuzume.

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What a stupid story.

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If you knew that I saw Nekomuzume,

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
you would have brought more friends.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You didn't think of it.

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Nekomuzume left because I was alone.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What time was it?

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Around 6 in the evening.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Around 6 in the evening.

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Where? Near your house?

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What were you doing?

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I was playing and coming back.

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
On your way home?

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What did you do?

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I was wearing a kimono

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that looked like a bakabon.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hey, hey.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was red.

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I was asking for the color.

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It was red.

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It looked like a bakabon.

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I was looking at

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the back of the kimono.

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You were looking at the back of the kimono?

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I was like,

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What kind of hairstyle was that?

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It looked like a bakabon.

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And your face?

321
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
My face was like a cat's eye.

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A cat-like eye?

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why were you standing like that?

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What were you doing?

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I was standing like this.

326
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why were you standing like that?

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was standing like this.

328
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Did you talk?

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No, not at all.

330
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Did you talk?

331
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I didn't talk.

332
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's the point.

333
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why didn't you say that?

334
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why didn't you say anything?

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You were looking at me.

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's the point.

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was looking at you.

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So I was standing like this.

339
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I was looking at you.

340
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Ah, at you.

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, yes.

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I was like,

343
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you.

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You!

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Didn't you just say that your ears were like this?

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You were doing like this.

347
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You were like a cat.

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What the hell?

349
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then, it's fine.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If it's like this, it's fine to lie.

351
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And then, on the roof, you were going like this.

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I was surprised.

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And then, you were like this.

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You were doing like this.

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You were talking like this.

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And then, you were like this.

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It was hard.

358
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But that was really like that.

359
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was the first time I heard that you saw a cat girl.

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I told you.

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It was the first time I heard that you were wearing a kimono.

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to see your kimono.

363
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I told you.

364
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's red.

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And it's colored.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't draw your ass.

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm talking to you.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why are you drawing your ass?

369
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're so rude.

370
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's right.

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It stinks.

372
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There's no one who's so cheeky.

373
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're also cheeky.

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why are you so cheeky?

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where is the material that you're not cheeky?

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What are you talking about?

377
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm a gentleman.

378
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's a gentleman's attitude.

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're the one who's a gentleman.

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What?

381
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
People who meet you for the first time don't talk to you.

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's how much you're a gentleman.

383
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know.

384
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What?

385
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
How to deal with people who are above you.

386
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do it properly.

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not doing it at all.

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Because when you're talking in the dressing room in the shadow,

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you've never said anything about people.

390
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You.

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've seen a lot of talents on this show.

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I've never said anything.

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Tamori is.

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Wait.

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you stupid?

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't understand that feeling.

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Did you raise your hand?

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Stop it.

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why are you a marionette?

400
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't know.

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm just dancing like a robot.

402
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Don't say stupid things.

403
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're saying a lot.

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm not saying anything.

405
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Please correct me.

406
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're saying a lot of stupid things.

407
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't say stupid things.

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Even about Sanma-san.

409
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've never said anything.

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't say stupid things.

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I can't believe it.

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Are you stupid?

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You're always talking about stupid things.

414
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Say it like that.

415
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Say it.

416
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're so strict.

417
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You should think about it.

418
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why are you laughing?

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm not laughing.

420
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What kind of car do you drive?

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And if you can modify your car as you like, what would you do?

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Modify my car?

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

424
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You like to tease me, don't you?

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You don't drive a normal car, do you?

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, I don't.

427
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm driving a normal car.

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If it's true, what do you want to do?

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So...

430
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What should I do?

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I want to cut the roof.

432
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm a Century now.

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm a Big Man.

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Why are you a Big Man?

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're a company.

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm an international company.

437
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why are you angry?

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Why are you so angry?

439
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So I want to cut the roof.

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't have a Century convertible.

441
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I see.

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I want to cut the roof.

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I see.

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's what I want to do.

445
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I see.

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What about you?

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I...

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I have a headlight.

449
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If I turn it on, a missile will come out.

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
When something happens.

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll do my best to turn it on.

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah.

453
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And I'll make a caterpillar.

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll go to many places.

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why are you an elementary school student?

456
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll make a tree.

457
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's nice.

458
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll put it on my house.

459
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Next.

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll stop this.

461
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll stop it.

462
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Is it OK?

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's OK.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Time is running out.

465
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, it's OK.

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's hard to laugh.

467
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's going to be hard to be a comedian.

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

470
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you know why?

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Why?

472
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Well...

473
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Japan is not only Japanese.

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

475
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There are many foreigners.

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There are.

477
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

478
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We have to involve foreigners.

479
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But foreigners who have been in Japan for a long time know Japanese.

480
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What's wrong with that?

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What?

482
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You're touching the caterpillar.

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm not touching it.

484
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why are you acting like this?

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What?

486
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
When you're talking, if you scratch your butt, you'll get a caterpillar.

487
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Stop it.

488
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What are you talking about?

489
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's going to be hard from now on.

490
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There are many foreigners.

491
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah.

492
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah.

493
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I was doing construction work.

494
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

495
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I was doing construction work in Ashiba-kun.

496
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I was building a house.

497
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I saw it.

499
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah.

500
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
They were all foreigners.

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

502
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
They were kneading cement.

503
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
They were all foreigners.

504
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The refrigerator was made by Eskimo.

505
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What are you talking about?

506
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What are you talking about?

507
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They were all foreigners.

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They're going to build a house for foreigners.

509
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

510
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hey, ask me something.

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Do you know that you're harming us?

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Harming you?

513
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
All you see are buttons.

514
