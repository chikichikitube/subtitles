1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Fight! Fight!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Give up! Give up!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No! No! No!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No! No!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Never give up!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fight! Fight!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Fight! Fight!

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Fight! Fight!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Give up!

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Fight! Fight!

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Fight! Fight!

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fight! Fight!

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Fight! Fight!

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Give up! Give up!

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Give up! Give up!

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,920
No! Answer!

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,920
Stop!

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There are 5 people.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
1,2,3,4,5. There are 5 people.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What? Why?

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you mean?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are 5 people.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, I'm the judge.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There are 4 people.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There are 6 people.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is that so?

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you doing?

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is strange.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you mean?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are there 5 people?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's do it properly.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's strange that there are no 4 people.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's strange.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's check.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's take a picture.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's take a picture.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who are you?

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Who are you?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Who are you?

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tanaka.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey, hey.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tanaka.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who are you?

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey, Enno.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, Enno.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is strange.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come here.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who are you?

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is me.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Look.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yama.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey, Enno.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good morning.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Good morning.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Enno.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Good morning.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Enno.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is strange.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who are you?

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, Enno.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, Enno.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Good morning.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are so slow.

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can't understand why you are so slow.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hey, Enno.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good morning, Enno.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Good morning.

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's wrong?

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Eh? The wind is coming!

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wait, wait!

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What are you doing?

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Good morning!

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Good morning!

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Good morning!

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Who is it?

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Shoei?

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You called me!

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Shoei, what's wrong?

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You called me!

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's wrong?

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, you see

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's wrong?

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's painful.

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Lend me your glasses.

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey, if you pass by...

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's Shohei-san.

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, Shohei-san. Good morning.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Good morning.

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What's the matter?

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing?

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What am I doing? You're a pro-wrestler.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not a pro-wrestler.

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is a 100,000 yen deal.

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you doing?

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm just passing by.

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm having fun.

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're in.

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not a pro-wrestler.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What?

111
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's not what a pro-wrestler is.

112
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're not a regular, are you?

113
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know how to use it.

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm doing it for 100,000 yen.

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
100,000 yen and prize money are fine.

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm not doing it for the prize money.

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why are you doing it?

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But that's a bit of a problem.

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Please go home.

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why?

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're in the way.

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not doing it this far.

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're the one who bought it.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm not a pro-wrestler.

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm a senior.

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm not a senior.

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have something to do after this.

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't think you have anything to do after this.

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have something to do.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're not doing it on a regular basis.

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm doing it because it looks fun.

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're a baby bird.

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm doing it because it looks fun.

137
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know what you mean.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Please explain.

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know what you mean.

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You don't read the atmosphere.

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm not doing it for you.

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm a senior.

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not a senior.

144
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not doing it on a regular basis.

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not doing it on a regular basis.

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not doing it on a regular basis.

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please go home.

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not doing it because I'm a senior.

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know.

151
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you talking about?

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't agree what you're saying.

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not doing it because I'm a senior.

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

155
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't have any seniors.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's strange, isn't it?

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you look into it, you're only half a year older than us.

158
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's normal.

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You know that I don't have any eyes on DORORESU, right?

160
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You knew that, right?

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm famous in the industry.

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm in it every now and then.

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't have any eyes on DORORESU.

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know that, right?

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You know that, right?

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll try not to do it next time.

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Really?

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're my senior.

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're a scumbag.

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll tell you later.

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm counting on you.

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll go to the next job.

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Excuse me.

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've never seen a man with such a sharp nose.

175
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You have a kind image.

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you for your hard work.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thank you for your hard work.

178
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you for your hard work.

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry, but let's do it again.

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's do it until someone gets 100,000 yen.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll do my best.

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's do it again.

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This program is provided by the following sponsors.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, my God.

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Stop, stop, stop.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There's another one.

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There's another one.

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
One, two, three, four, five.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There are five people.

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Four people started earlier.

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Two people are back.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, yes, yes.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, yes, yes.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Stop.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Stop.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Stop.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There are five people.

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's do it.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's funny because there are five people.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's do it.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who is this?

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Who is this?

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who is this?

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who is this?

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who is this?

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who is this?

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Who is this?

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Who is this?

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are you doing?

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What are you doing?

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you for your hard work.

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's do it again.

214
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mr. Suga.

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Mr. Suga.

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Mr. Suga.

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Stop that old man.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Stop that old man.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's wrong?

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's do it.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is Mr. Ise?

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm on the show right now.

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm playing Doro.

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is a TV show.

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was doing it when I passed by.

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I love Doro.

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a problem if you don't come in.

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Four people are doing it.

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It looks fun.

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This isn't a TV show, is it?

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's not a TV show.

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There are a lot of cameras.

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Aren't you playing?

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're not friends, are you?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. Doro.

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're lying.

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're lying.

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're lying.

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I saw it in 30 seconds in Shinjuku.

244
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know the skinship of soccer.

245
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's do it.

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Who's the one who's going to do it?

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's something I want to talk to you about.

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's something I want to talk to you about.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What is it?

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going to do it.

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's talk.

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's talk.

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm getting a call.

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm getting a call.

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's talk.

258
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's talk.

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's do it.

260
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a recording, so I'm sorry.

261
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's better than our seniors.

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's better than our seniors.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Take him.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll introduce you to a good camera.

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll introduce you to a good camera.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a shame.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a shame.

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's our first time.

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's our first time.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's our first time.

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's our first time.

272
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's our first time.

273
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's our first time.

274
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know who it is.

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know who it is.

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're good at it.

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're good at it.

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're good at it.

279
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm back.

280
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What is it?

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's up with the entertainment world these days?

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What's up with the entertainment world these days?

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's like this.

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's like this.

285
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like this.

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Everyone is here.

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's like this.

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's impossible for me to have a meal.

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You have to find an opportunity.

290
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You have to find an opportunity.

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And one more thing.

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And one more thing.

293
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Take a look at the Hamada.

294
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Take a look at the Hamada.

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Take a look at the Hamada.

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,640
What is this!

297
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,400
What!

298
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,800
Hey!

299
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
What is this!

300
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,020
azione

301
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,560
Hey!

302
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,340
Ohhhh!

303
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,760
I can see your eyes

304
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Oh sensei, it's cold.

305
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
There's mud in my eyes.

306
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,760
It was good.

307
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
It's got out!!

308
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Chrysanthemum mud.

309
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,760
ify checking

310
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,760
My eyes are already dry.

311
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Please take off your mask.

312
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
1,2,3,4

313
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
There are 5 of them.

314
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Look.

315
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Who are you?

316
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Come here.

317
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Who are you?

318
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Who are you?

319
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
You are so energetic.

320
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Who are you?

321
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Who are you?

322
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
What?

323
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Who are you?

324
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
What?

325
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Who are you?

326
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Take off your goggles.

327
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Who are you?

328
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Dave.

329
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Dave Spector.

330
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
What are you doing?

331
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Look at his face.

332
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
What are you doing?

333
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
What are you doing?

334
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,760
There is a patting center near here.

335
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes.

336
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I was doing it.

337
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I saw it.

338
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
No, no, no.

339
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
It says 100,000 yen.

340
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
I want to give you 100,000 yen.

341
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
No, no, no.

342
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
What?

343
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
I'll be in trouble if you come in.

344
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Why?

345
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
This is the last one.

346
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
I wanted to give you the last one.

347
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
That's right.

348
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
If you get in the way, you'll be in trouble.

349
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Why are you making a fuss?

350
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
If you're a foreigner, you'll be colorful.

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
I don't think so.

352
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,760
I don't think I'll be colorful.

353
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
It's cheap, so it's okay.

354
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
I'm enjoying it on a regular basis.

355
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
That's right.

356
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I want to participate.

357
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,760
It's not that easy.

358
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,760
It's okay to do it on a regular basis, but you need to change the picture on TV.

359
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
That's right.

360
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Then let's do it.

361
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
No, no, no.

362
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
What?

363
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Referee.

364
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Referee.

365
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Referee.

366
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
There's a picture, so I'll accept it.

367
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Mr. Suga.

368
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Mr. Suga.

369
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Mr. Suga.

370
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Mr. Suga.

371
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Why can't you do it?

372
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

373
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
It's an opportunity.

374
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Yes.

375
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

376
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
What?

377
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm doing it on a regular basis.

378
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Regular people don't enjoy it that much.

379
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I'll do it as soon as I can.

380
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Do you want to be forced to do it or do you want to go home?

381
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
I don't want to be forced to do it, but I want to do it on my own.

382
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
That's right.

383
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
You don't like it, do you?

384
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
You don't like it, do you?

385
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Go home.

386
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Please don't come for five or six years.

387
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
It's been a while.

388
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
It's been a while, five or six years.

389
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
What's that feeling?

390
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Hey, hey, hey.

391
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
I've been doing it for a long time.

392
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Yes.

393
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I can't help it if I do more than this.

394
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Do you give up?

395
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Do you want to do it again?

396
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I give up.

397
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Do you give up?

398
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Yes.

399
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I give up.

400
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Do you give up 100,000 yen?

401
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Mr. Matsumoto.

402
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I give up.

403
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Do you give up?

404
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Of course.

405
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I give up.

406
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Well, we've prepared the prize money.

407
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Yes.

408
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
This time, everyone will draw.

409
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Yes.

410
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I'll never do this again.

411
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Thank you very much.

412
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Thank you very much.

413
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Thank you for your hard work.

414
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Thank you for your hard work.

415
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Ladies and gentlemen.

416
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,760
How does a sandbag get sand?

417
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Well, the sandbag in the old days.

418
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
The sandbag in the old days.

419
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
I don't know if I can say this.

420
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
It's the same with everything.

421
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
There's a saying that it used to be good.

422
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Oh, well, there is.

423
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
That's right.

424
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
For example, in the old days.

425
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I really only ate natural things.

426
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Well, even if it's fish.

427
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Now it's time for Western food.

428
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
But that's normal now.

429
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Tatami is a good song.

430
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
It's just like tatami.

431
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,760
There's no real tatami.

432
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
I see.

433
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,760
It's like a tatami carpet.

434
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Good things are disappearing.

435
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
The sandbag is the same.

436
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,760
The sandbag now is not serious.

437
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
What?

438
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
It used to be serious.

439
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
What do you mean?

440
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
It used to be sandbag.

441
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I see.

442
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
It used to be sandbag.

443
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,760
The sandbag now is pro-wrestling.

444
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
It's decided.

445
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
What?

446
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
It's decided.

447
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
It's decided.

448
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
It's noisy now, isn't it?

449
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
It used to be noisy for children.

450
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,760
But now it's noisy.

451
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
What are you doing?

452
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Why are you putting sand on the sandbag?

453
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,760
The PTA is noisy.

454
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,760
If you complain, the old lady has no money.

455
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
What are you doing now?

456
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
The old lady...

457
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
It's a lie.

458
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
What's a lie?

459
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
I didn't put sand on the sandbag.

460
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
You didn't?

461
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I didn't.

462
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Why did you put sand on the sandbag?

463
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
I pretended to put sand on the sandbag.

464
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
I pretended to put sand on the sandbag.

465
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
I put on a kimono.

466
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
It's OK to wear a kimono.

467
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Really?

468
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
That's OK?

469
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
That's OK.

470
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
So you didn't get the sandbag.

471
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Now all the monsters are lies.

472
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Really?

473
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Yes.

474
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
How did the old lady put sand on the sandbag?

475
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
She really put sand on the sandbag.

476
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Did she put sand on the sandbag?

477
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
No.

478
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
She put sand on the sandbag.

479
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:51,760
If I say this much, the old lady will get angry.

480
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Can you hear me clearly?

481
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Don't get angry.

482
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,760
There was sand on the sandbag and sand on the sandbag.

483
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
I see.

484
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Did you use the sandbag separately?

485
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Yes.

486
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
In the past?

487
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Yes.

488
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,760
I see.

489
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Now I only use sandbag samples.

490
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,760
If I put sand on the sandbag, the old lady will get angry.

491
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
I see.

492
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Now I only use sandbag samples.

493
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I see.

494
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
The old lady is not as small as she used to be.

495
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Is that so?

496
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
The old lady is not as small as she used to be.

497
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Is that so?

498
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Compared to her age, she looks bigger than a monkey.

499
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I think so.

500
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I don't think so.

501
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I don't think so.

502
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Yu-gi is the same.

503
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
What do you think?

504
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
What do you think?

505
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Yu-gi is the same.

506
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Yu-gi is the same.

507
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I think Yu-gi is the same.

508
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Don't say that!

509
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I have a question for you, Matsumoto-san.

510
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,760
How humble should you behave in front of a great person?

511
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,760
And if you're rude, how should you react?

512
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
The greatest person in the world?

513
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
He's amazing.

514
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Who is he?

515
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
He's in the Soviet Union.

516
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,760
In the Soviet Union?

517
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Pescatora.

518
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
La Pescatora.

519
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Which one?

520
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Don't lie to me.

521
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
You can't say La.

522
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I can't say La.

523
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
What does he do?

524
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
He's a student.

525
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
What?

526
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
What do you mean a student?

527
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,760
If you're a great person, it's your prejudice that you're older.

528
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I see.

529
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Even high school students are great people.

530
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
This is the greatest person in the world.

531
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
So what makes you think you're great?

532
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
That's the question.

533
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
It's a philosophical question.

534
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
What makes you think you're great?

535
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
But what's written here is a little strange.

536
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
This isn't it.

537
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
I thought it was a little strange.

538
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Why?

539
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,760
What happens when you're rude?

540
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
I see.

541
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
You don't get angry.

542
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Really?

543
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Because you're a great person.

544
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
No matter what you do?

545
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes.

546
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
No matter what you say?

547
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Yes.

548
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
You laugh.

549
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Humans are big.

550
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Humans are big.

551
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,760
But the louder you laugh, the more angry you are.

552
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Then you're angry.

553
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Right?

554
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
I'm starting to understand that.

555
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
For example, you spill water.

556
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
You think you're a great person.

557
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
At that time, you start to get close to each other.

558
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
You smoke.

559
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I don't smoke!

560
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Why don't you smoke?

561
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,760
This is the most angry person in the world.

562
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
But you don't do anything?

563
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
I don't smoke.

564
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
You tell me to stay at home.

565
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Right?

566
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
If you stay at home, you'll get a cramp in your shoe.

567
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
You're really a student.

568
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I knew you were angry.

569
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Mr. Matsumoto was elected the other day.

570
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Yes.

571
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,760
It seems that he lost the election because he couldn't be on TV.

572
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
What is the cause of the defeat?

573
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:45,760
First of all, the biggest reason is that I didn't run for office.

574
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
This is the only reason.

575
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
I didn't put up the election posters.

576
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
But I was running for office.

577
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
What?

578
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
I had a huge burden.

579
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
But I don't understand that.

580
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,760
But I had the feeling that I was running for office somewhere.

581
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,760
On Sunday, when the election was open.

582
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I was looking around.

583
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
It doesn't matter.

584
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
It doesn't matter, so I didn't look around.

585
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I didn't look around.

586
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
But I was looking around while doing the dishes.

587
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
You're the only one who's looking around.

588
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
But I didn't run for office.

589
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I said it by accident.

590
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
I thought the Japanese people didn't understand.

591
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
No, I don't understand.

592
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I didn't run for office.

593
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,760
But I don't understand why people don't run for office.

594
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
I don't understand that.

595
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I thought so.

596
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,760
I can change.

597
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I can change.

598
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I can change.
