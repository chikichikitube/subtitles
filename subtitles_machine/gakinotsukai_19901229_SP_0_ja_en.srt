1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Uchimura and Yuya-chan, when you come to the dining room, you eat curry, right?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ramen, please.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Are you angry?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ramen, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ramen, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is the real face.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm fine.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the 10th year next year.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hama-chan, please introduce our members.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hama-chan, please introduce our members.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hama-chan, please introduce our members.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is the leader.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm a child's user.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm a child's user.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Tanaka.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm the second.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm Asayama.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This person.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Nice to meet you.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is our captain.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm the captain.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You introduce the members one by one again.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the leader.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm a child's user.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is Masato Irie.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nice to meet you.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is the leader.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm Asayama.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This person.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm the second.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Nice to meet you.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is the opening of the bag.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How do you introduce the members?

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want more.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No one is coming.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm a child's user.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm a child's user.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It started.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why do we have two groups here?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Nan-chan is doing a program called Sharara.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
After that, we are the child's users.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We do it every 30 minutes.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's do this one by one and go to the program.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's all messed up.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you notice, we're all dancing.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't think so.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please change.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Today, the members of Sharara are here.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How are you doing?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is your program interesting?

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
To be honest.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The highlight of the program is the Chiki Chiki corner every time.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Isn't that our program?

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We do it every week.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sometimes it's just the two of us.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sometimes it's just the two of us.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the one-man play.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's interesting.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is that interesting?

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nanbara, please talk.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What about us?

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is it interesting?

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's more interesting than the snake and the tiger's hole.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's get started.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please say the title of the program.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a little long.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There's a campaign in front of you.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
U-chan, Nan-chan, and Round-Round-chan.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sharara's使いや愛!

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's start with the last part.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's start with U-chan, Nan-chan.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Please look at the board in the back.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's still a lot left.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We've got this much VTR.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've done a lot of things.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's take a look at it.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's the latest one?

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The latest one is...

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Find a poor man.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How do you find a poor man?

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm looking for a poor man.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just like that.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've seen a movie called Tenryu.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really?

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Really?

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've seen it.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've got it ready.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Really?

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I haven't seen it.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've seen it a lot.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You've seen it a lot?

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You've seen Nyororo, right?

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll leave it to you.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I've got 1 million yen.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What haven't you seen?

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I haven't seen skydiving.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I haven't seen it.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to see it.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was scared.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Really?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's start with us.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's start with us.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's start with us.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's start with us.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is what he went for.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is what he went for.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He said, let's do a punishment game.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He said, let's do a punishment game.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How would you play if you lose?

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is What the Shinabichi Shogun was doing back then.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is What the Shinabichi Shogun was doing back then.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No one knows.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Nobody knows.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is it an old thing?

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hello? Hello? I'm on my way now.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sleeping right now.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Look at where I'm going.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Zoom in towards Shizuoka!

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Shizuoka!

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's like this.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
However, if you go into the shade, it will be slippery, so please be careful.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's go to Nippon Netto's new movie.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Zoom in!

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not a prank!

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hello? Do you like me?

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Will you still look at me as a partner?

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did it.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Did you see it?

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Tome-san is a little angry.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Did you see it?

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Next is the bird-human contest in Hamada.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's nostalgic.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It was Su, right?

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I thought he was drunk.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I was waiting for the ball.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tome-san ignored me and asked me to do it.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When I came home, he said he wouldn't get up.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I couldn't talk to him until the morning.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I couldn't do it anymore.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't ask!

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We are good at curry, but we are also good at Tenryu.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you good at cooking?

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm good at it, but I don't hate it.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm lazy, so I don't cook much.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Tome-san!

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm scared of the microphone.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not good at cooking.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You eat a lot at night.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How many people eat?

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't eat much at night.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Young people eat.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But you can eat two or three people, right?

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I can eat five or six people.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You didn't go to eat barbecue, did you?

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I didn't go to eat barbecue.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It was more delicious to eat meat and smoke.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is your hair a perm?

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This?

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've always wondered if you were going to get a perm.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are you going to get a perm?

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Tenryu made it all.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We are good at it, but we are also good at it.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's the right answer.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Tenryu is the best!

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I have a lot of capacity, but I'm not good at it.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't like people who have big feet like me.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I often say that.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I often say that.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The fourth round is a power competition.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wait a minute.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why don't you compare this?

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Humans are not big.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's all about energy.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm going to beat Tenryu with my energy.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're a tiger.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You look like a tiger.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right. I'm going to do my best with that energy.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't die, Tenryu!

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're the one who's dead!

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going to die!

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm going to do my best.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's do it at the end.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm going to die.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That was the most painful thing I've ever had in my life.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I couldn't get a perm for about three hours.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really?

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It was swollen.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're not in the army, are you?

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, I'm a guard.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm the main character of Nambara.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's move on to the next round.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm going to be the virtual captain.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I got 1 million yen for the virtual captain.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Which one is this?

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Both.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I fell down once.

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You didn't die?

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I tried again.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I saw both.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You saw both?

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm a fan.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I fell down.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I like this one better.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Here you go.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is the first time.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I got lost.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come on.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Help me.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know if I'm going to make it.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know if I'm going to make it.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you very much.

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's finally the last one.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You look very nervous.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm nervous.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's go.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No.40 pass line.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How was it?

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How many points did the judges give?

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm glad.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll give you a little more points.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It hurts.

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Congratulations.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm glad.

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But I failed.

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I can't win.

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll give you a little more points.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why are you looking up?

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Please.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't use your legs.

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have plenty of time.

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:26,000
My legs.

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I did this twice.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was a famous trick.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I missed it on the way.

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You came back in that outfit.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You look very happy.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I didn't make it to the second place.

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I thought I would win.

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There weren't many people with high scores.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When I won, I did this.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't have to be happy.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll give you four points.

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I haven't won yet.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You haven't won yet?

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You have to win.

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll give you four points.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You should think about it.

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was an amateur trick.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It was from Amagasaki.

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The first trick was a chameleon.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It fell.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It took a long time for poop to come out.

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We don't like practice, so we didn't do it.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Next, we did something with the five of us.

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It was a play.

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was a holiday before the year.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You went to play?

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

269
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's good.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's fun.

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What you saw was Tetsu's roller coaster.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
His face when he was on the roller coaster.

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It was a close-up.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I went to play.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It was delicious.

276
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You went to Okinawa, didn't you?

277
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I went on a normal tour.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was cheap.

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's use the drinks in front of us.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We'll play a game.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We'll play a game.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We'll play a game with the person on the roller coaster.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We'll guess the character.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Uchimura team.

286
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We'll show it like this.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wait.

288
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Are you ready?

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm fighting with Dustin Hoffman.

290
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's start.

291
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
How is it?

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's going to be fast.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's going to be fast.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's going to be fast.

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's going to be fast.

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's going to be fast.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Dustin Hoffman.

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's coming.

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's definitely going to be fast.

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's going to be fast.

301
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's going to be fast.

302
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's going to be fast.

303
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's going to be fast.

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's scanning the test.

305
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't give me a hint.

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I know.

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't give me a hint.

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's scanning the test.

309
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't give me a hint.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know.

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I know.

312
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's scanning the test.

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's scanning the test.

315
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was not afraid when I rode with you.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was not afraid when I rode with you.

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
10.

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Here it comes!

319
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I can not!

320
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can not!

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OMG!

322
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I!"ll get nervous at first.

323
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He'll be envious for the 2nd time.

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Your face is really bad!

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Next time, let's change the order

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This time, the two of us will do something serious

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's do it seriously

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Tetsu-chan laughed

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Again?

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Tetsu-chan laughed

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Again?

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Tetsu-chan also tried

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You also have a good character

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Wajima Koichi-san, the world champion

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Wajima-san's boxing challenge

336
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Good evening

337
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Good evening

338
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Nice to meet you

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Here?

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Here?

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you doing?

342
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
One, two

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
One, two?

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
One, two?

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
One, two?

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
One, two?

347
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
One, two?

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
One, two?

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
One, two?

350
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Come on

351
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
One, two?

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why are you laughing?

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm scared.

354
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Fight!

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's fun.

356
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm scared.

357
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Stop!

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You win!

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Don't lose to a frog.

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You're done.

361
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll give you a punch.

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm ready.

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're good.

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm scared.

365
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Stop!

366
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm scared.

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're done.

368
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm scared.

369
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm scared.

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're done.

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm scared.

372
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You're done.

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm scared.

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Stop!

375
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Stop!

376
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm scared.

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll give you a punch.

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm scared.

379
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You're good.

380
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I can't remember anything.

381
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It was a tough fight.

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You were out of breath.

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You were crying.

384
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You were crying.

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You were crying.

386
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was about to hit the corner.

387
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was about to hit the corner.

388
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I hit the corner.

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I hit you.

390
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I hit the corner.

391
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I hit you.

392
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I was trying to beat him up.

393
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Suddenly, I thought it was fun.

394
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Next, we have a guest who is watching our program.

395
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He is a big fan and a guest.

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Please come out.

397
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
May I?

398
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The guest is this man.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

400
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm busy.

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hurry up.

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Uchimura, why didn't you become a boxer?

403
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I didn't know.

404
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Nice to meet you.

405
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you.

406
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Please sit down.

407
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You are always beautiful.

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm used to being told that.

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm used to being told that.

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm used to being told that.

411
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I've never done that.

412
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Really?

413
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He is watching us.

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry, but it's 1 o'clock, right?

415
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes, it's before that.

416
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I went skydiving.

418
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's great.

419
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's like the night before you fall.

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I was really scared.

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's scary.

422
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Thank you.

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
How about this one?

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's funny.

425
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Uchimura is preparing for the show.

426
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Ready, set, go.

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm scared.

428
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm really scared.

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm really scared.

430
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm still scared.

431
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's go.

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's scary.

433
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's coming down.

434
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's coming down.

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He is waving his hand.

436
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Can he land safely?

437
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The landing is the problem.

438
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Congratulations.

439
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It was scary.

440
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It was really scary.

441
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't know what to say.

442
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm really moved.

443
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Thank you.

444
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's great.

445
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I can't do that.

446
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Have you ever been separated from the person on the top?

447
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If I was separated, I would say goodbye.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Don't you have a parachute?

449
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't.

450
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If you were separated...

451
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't know about that.

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I feel like I'm going to get hit by a car.

453
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I was scared before I flew.

454
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I was working in Osaka the day before that.

455
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I couldn't sleep.

456
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So I went to karaoke.

457
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I was singing, but I couldn't sleep.

458
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I couldn't sing because I was too excited.

459
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This is a penalty game.

460
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That's right.

461
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Which one of you said this?

462
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This one.

463
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Actually, I like the sky.

464
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You wanted to fly, didn't you?

465
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I wanted to try it once.

466
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I see.

467
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It can't be helped.

468
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Your mother saw this.

469
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I cried.

470
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Thank you very much.

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Does your mother cry?

472
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Even the demon's eyes are full of tears.

473
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
How was it?

474
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I wanted to try skydiving every time.

475
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Really?

476
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But listen to me.

477
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I felt like I was going to fall.

478
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I felt like I was flying.

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But I was just falling.

480
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
How many kilometers did you fly?

481
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
300 kilometers.

482
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
At first, the wind was strong.

483
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But after a while, the wind came from below.

484
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So I felt like I was flying.

485
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I experienced it.

486
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The wind came from above, not from above.

487
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I did it in the air.

488
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But the wind was too strong.

489
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I couldn't breathe.

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I couldn't breathe.

491
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I felt like I was flying.

492
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I felt like I was flying.

493
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I felt like I was flying.

494
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That's why the wind is strong.

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Next.

496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Please look at it together.

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Mark Costabi.

498
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He was going to explode this fall.

499
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He is a liar and an artist.

500
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mark Costabi is an artist.

501
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He challenged pop art.

502
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
All of a sudden?

503
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
All of a sudden, art came to my chest.

504
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He drew anything that caught his eye.

505
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
He drew it.

506
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, no.

507
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, no.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, no.

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's just dirty.

510
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This is art.

511
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't look at it.

512
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, oh, oh.

513
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh, oh.

514
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, oh.

515
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh, oh.

516
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Oh, oh.

517
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, oh.

518
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, oh.

519
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What are you doing to my face?

520
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Costabi.

521
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What are you doing?

522
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Don't talk to me.

523
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
One more time.

524
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
What are you doing?

525
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Don't talk to me.

526
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Don't talk to me.

527
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I like this work.

528
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Did you like it?

529
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm honored.

530
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
This is great.

531
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Great.

532
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's not funny if I translate it into Japanese.

533
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
This is...

534
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There are a lot of book seals in foreign countries.

535
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
There are tens of thousands of them.

536
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
When it's over, I'll translate it into Japanese.

537
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This summer, there will be a big boom.

538
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This fall, in Japan.

539
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Do you know that?

540
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
No.

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't know at all.

542
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You guys only lost money.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This is...

544
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We just watched a video of art.

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We have a guest.

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
He's a painting teacher.

547
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That's great.

548
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Let's see.

549
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Please come in.

550
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh, teacher.

551
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Teacher.

552
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What's his painting?

553
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Animal painting.

554
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There's no animal in Japan.

555
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
He can paint a lot of things.

556
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
For example, can I draw something?

557
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Is there a dog?

558
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Can you draw a dog?

559
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
He's quick to draw.

560
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He's quick to draw.

561
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
This is a dog.

562
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Wait a minute.

563
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is a dog.

564
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is this person really a painter?

565
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Mr. Kagasawa.

566
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Mr. Kagasawa.

567
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I can't do that.

568
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Wait a minute. Does this look like a dog?

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What does this look like?

570
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
A rotten pig.

571
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Let's draw a rotten pig.

572
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
A rotten pig.

573
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This is a pig.

574
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's the same.

575
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What?

576
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's the same pig.

577
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's hard to praise a father.

578
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's hard to praise a father.

579
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Please sign this.

580
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Thank you.

581
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Actually, I haven't seen it.

582
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We don't know, but there's a fun video.

583
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's watch it.

584
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You guys are stupid.

585
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's funny.

586
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You're young.

587
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You're young.

588
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's funny.

589
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's funny.

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's funny.

591
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Thank you for editing it.

592
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's a video that shouldn't be done as a person.

593
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's funny.

594
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You're holding back a lot.

595
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You're holding back a lot.

596
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Don't do it.

597
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey.

598
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You shouldn't do it.

599
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Of course.

600
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But Mr. Kagasawa will be angry if you get hit.

601
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't like it.

602
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's right.

603
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll do it seriously.

604
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You can do it seriously.

605
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You didn't come to my academy.

606
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I told you.

607
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I told you.

608
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
What are you doing?

609
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Who was the first one to come?

610
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's you.

611
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's me.

612
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's funny.

613
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's funny.

614
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's Mr. Uchiyama.

615
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This time, we did the choreography of Omitoshiman.

616
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
This time, it's a special episode.

617
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The two of you from Downtown will do the choreography of Omitoshiman.

618
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Do you want to do it?

619
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm very motivated.

620
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I've already decided on the costume.

621
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I asked them to make it this color.

622
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'd like to call you.

623
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I love dancing.

624
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm from Downtown.

625
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm Mr. Uchiyama.

626
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
This time, we did the choreography of Omitoshiman.

627
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This time, it's a special episode.

628
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The two of you from Downtown will do the choreography of Omitoshiman.

629
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Do you want to do it?

630
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm very motivated.

631
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I've already decided on the costume.

632
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I asked them to make it this color.

633
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'd like to call you.

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I love dancing.

635
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm from Downtown.

636
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Please.

637
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm very motivated.

638
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Can you take a picture of me?

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm sleeping.

640
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm a trainee, so my cape is short.

641
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
How long does it take to get there?

642
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It doesn't take long.

643
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I can dance from the cushion.

644
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't talk nonsense.

645
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I have a dance program.

646
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm just watching.

647
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Dance, dance, dance.

648
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll change anytime.

649
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We're not the only ones who choreographed it.

650
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
This is the choreography of Omitoshiman.

651
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The wink.

652
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You just have to wink.

653
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Mr. Igarashi.

654
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Mr. Hamada, come anytime.

655
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What's wrong with him?

656
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I have a dance program.

657
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Show us.

658
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't know.

659
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's a good choreography.

660
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Idiot.

661
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Brothers.

662
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Brother.

663
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Which one is my brother?

664
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Are you both the same?

665
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No.

666
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Which one is difficult?

667
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I don't like Nan-chan's choreography.

668
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Nan-chan's choreography is difficult.

669
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Which one is difficult?

670
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I like dancing.

671
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I like Uki-chan.

672
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's why.

673
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Hama-chan is my brother.

674
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I like Mach-chan's face.

675
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Idiot brothers.

676
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Please leave it to me.

677
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I have a dance program.

678
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's a dance program.

679
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's a bow.

680
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's a bow.

681
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Turn your body like this.

682
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Cross your legs.

683
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Again, turn to the right.

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
From the back.

685
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Turn your legs.

686
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
From the inside.

687
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Ready, go!

688
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Turn your legs to the side.

689
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's good.

690
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Hide your face behind your mask.

691
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Here.

692
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm back.

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I don't know how to do this.

694
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What are you doing?

695
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
How do you do it?

696
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's a step.

697
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What do you do with your hat?

698
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Like this.

699
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Right, left, right, right.

700
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Right, left, right, right.

701
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You can't do it at all.

702
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You can't do it at all.

703
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You can't do it at all.

704
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You can't do it at all.

705
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I can't do it at all.

707
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
How do you do it?

708
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
When you bend your right leg,

709
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
your left leg bends.

710
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Can you practice this first?

711
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Practice.

712
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Old man.

713
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Anything.

714
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Old man.

715
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Please do something.

716
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Please do something.

717
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, well, well.

718
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You can't do it.

719
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But you can do it.

720
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I got it.

721
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You got the first part.

722
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You, you.

723
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You, you.

724
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You, you.

725
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You, you.

726
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You, you.

727
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You, you.

728
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You, you.

729
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You, you.

730
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You, you.

731
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You, you.

732
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
No, no.

733
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The one to go to the side.

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No.

735
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And this part is...

736
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
...just right.

737
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Ah, I got it.

738
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You step on it like this.

739
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
From close up.

740
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Ah, that's good.

741
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Just step on it.

742
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay, okay.

743
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay, okay.

744
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That's good.

745
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That's good.

746
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That's good.

747
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's good.

748
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Smile, smile.

749
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
That's good.

750
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's good.

751
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That's good.

752
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's good.

753
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's good.

754
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Your heart is my...

755
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
...soul.

756
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Have fun.

757
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Have fun.

758
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Your heart is my...

759
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
...soul.

760
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
...soul.

761
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
SOUL.

762
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
SOUL.

763
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
SOUL.

764
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
SOUL.

765
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SOUL.

766
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
SOUL.

767
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm not sleepy enough.

768
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Wait, wait, wait.

769
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Wait a second.

770
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That's right.

771
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Anything is my...

772
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
...soul.

773
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
SOUL.

774
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
SOUL.

775
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
SOUL.

776
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
SOUL.

777
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
SOUL.

778
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
SOUL.

779
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SOUL.

780
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Your...

781
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
...soul.

782
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Your heart is my...

783
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
...soul.

784
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SOUL.

785
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SOUL.

786
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
SOUL.

787
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
SOUL.

788
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
SOUL.

789
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
SOUL.

790
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SOUL.

791
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
SOUL.

792
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
When I was 1,

793
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You were such soft.

794
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Though you fell.

795
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Although you were such soft.

796
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Like this.

797
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
yourkew?

798
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
O-Mi-To-O-Si-Ki-Ko-Yu

799
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Good, good, good

800
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's the best

801
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That's the best

802
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
From the right

803
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Good, good, good

804
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Say something

805
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Say something

806
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Say something

807
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
O-Mi-To-To-Ma-Shi-To-To-Ma-Shi

808
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Free

809
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Say something

810
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Say something

811
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Turn back

812
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And then

813
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Hama-san is

814
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Go to the back

815
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Good

816
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Good

817
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Wow you can do it

818
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm tired.

819
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Come on.

820
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Turn your back.

821
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You can do it.

822
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Good.

823
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Excellent.

824
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's so bright.

825
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Each of them has their own characteristics.

826
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
They're all unique.

827
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Come on.

828
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And pose.

829
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Please forgive me.

830
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
After this, in front of the audience.

831
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Are you okay?

832
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm okay.

833
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I did better than I thought.

834
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But I'm the only one who's angry.

835
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's a special edition.

836
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I want to be a part of it.

837
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I want to be a trainee.

838
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I want to dance.

839
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
There are two people who want to dance.

840
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I want to invite them.

841
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Come on.

842
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Who taught you that?

843
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We were forced to do this.

844
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's really lame.

845
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's a little lame.

846
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The cape is really short.

847
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What's the difference?

848
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's the difference in the choreography.

849
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I want you to wear this glove.

850
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The sky is really blue.

851
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because you're a weirdo.

852
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The sea is really wide.

853
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Because you're a weirdo.

854
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I want you to see me.

855
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I want you to see your heart.

856
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I want you to see your heart.

857
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I want you to see your heart.

858
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I want you to see your heart.

859
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I want you to see your heart.

860
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I want you to see your heart.

861
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I want you to see your heart.

862
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I want you to see your heart.

863
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I want you to see your heart.

864
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I want you to see your heart.

865
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I want you to see your heart.

866
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I want you to see your heart.

867
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I want you to see your heart.

868
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm tired.

869
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm tired.

870
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm tired.

871
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm really tired.

872
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm tired.

873
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But it was fun, wasn't it?

874
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Nan-chan and Duncan Special Chiki Chiki Ultra Special Exciting Powerful Super Human Bowling 1990

875
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Today is the first episode.

876
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Let's start right away.

877
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We're going to do human bowling.

878
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Today is special.

879
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Just like the title.

880
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The person who loses will be punished.

881
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's just like we always do.

882
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But can I ask you one thing?

883
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Why?

884
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
What does it mean to have two timekeepers on the show?

885
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Don't you feel something weird?

886
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I think it's because I'm a male.

887
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I don't know if there's going to be a kick or something.

888
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Let's get on the show right away.

889
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Uchano-chan.

890
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
This is it, isn't it?

891
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Uchano Chiki Chiki.

892
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm watching.

893
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
For example, I don't know if Uchano is going to hit me or Nan-chan is going to hit me.

894
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
What are you going to do about that?

895
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Is this a punishment game?

896
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There's a punishment game.

897
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
If you lose, the two losing teams will be in this bowling ball.

898
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
This is the case of Ikuta Studio.

899
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's weird, isn't it?

900
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm doing it as a talent.

901
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Why is it a punishment game because I lost?

902
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It's weird.

903
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
All the staff are looking at their faces.

904
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
That's a punishment game.

905
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm more like Hamada-san.

906
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That's the way it is.

907
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm confident about this.

908
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm serious.

909
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I brought a big ball today.

910
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's my ball.

911
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I brought it.

912
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
This is it.

913
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
This is the biggest.

914
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's amazing.

915
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm serious about this.

916
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'll do it.

917
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Leave it to me.

918
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

919
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

920
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Which one are you going to throw?

921
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Here.

922
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
How do you throw it?

923
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
How do you throw it?

924
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
From this line.

925
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The line is fine, but how do you hold it?

926
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You can throw it.

927
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You can throw it from above.

928
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It's up to you.

929
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Teacher, our troupe...

930
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Say it.

931
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What should we do with the troupe?

932
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Excuse me.

933
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Please put on the special item.

934
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Thank you.

935
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You can put it on.

936
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm in the same situation as her.

937
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What?

938
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
What do you mean?

939
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Thank you.

940
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

941
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You hit me from the first word.

942
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
We're friends.

943
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
We're friends.

944
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But he's a troublemaker.

945
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Number 15.

946
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
My team will go first.

947
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'll go first.

948
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
This is the first round.

949
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It hurts.

950
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Ouch.

951
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Ouch.

952
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It hurts.

953
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It hurts.

954
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Mr. Hamada, who made a good strike, will get a gold medal.

955
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's easy.

956
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What is this?

957
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's like a baka.

958
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's easy.

959
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
We have 10 points.

960
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Captain.

961
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm not confident.

962
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
How can I hold it?

963
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It's up to you.

964
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
What do you think?

965
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
What is this?

966
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Please.

967
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Let's go.

968
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
This is strange.

969
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
What?

970
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Did you have a meeting?

971
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Two.

972
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Two.

973
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
If you knock down all the numbers.

974
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Hey.

975
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'll throw it from there, right?

976
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yes.

977
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It's up.

978
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It's up.

979
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
How many did you knock down?

980
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Two?

981
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Why did you knock down?

982
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'll give you three.

983
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I didn't knock down at all.

984
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Help me.

985
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
The second one is the pillow.

986
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The second one is the pillow.

987
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I don't think it's possible.

988
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Let's go.

989
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
The pillow is too light.

990
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's hard to knock down.

991
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It's difficult.

992
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It's impossible.

993
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I knocked down one.

994
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Are you serious?

995
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'll give you three.

996
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Idiot.

997
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I was holding back.

998
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Didn't you knock down before?

999
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
What?

1000
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You knocked down.

1001
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But the way you knocked down is correct.

1002
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It's up.

1003
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
When you knock down, go back.

1004
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That's right.

1005
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

1006
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
You're throwing it from a great place.

1007
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You're throwing it from a great place.

1008
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I have to run.

1009
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
The second one.

1010
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Let's go.

1011
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I'm holding back.

1012
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm holding back.

1013
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Don't make a fuss.

1014
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Nambara, who showed us a great kick, will receive a gift from Tokyo Station.

1015
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This is the last one.

1016
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
How about a double game?

1017
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Please appear.

1018
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It's okay.

1019
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Are you ready?

1020
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
What is this guy?

1021
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Let's go.

1022
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm holding back.

1023
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Good.

1024
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You're fast.

1025
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You're fast.

1026
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Ichimura, who showed us a great kick, will receive a gift from Yoshimoto Co., Ltd.

1027
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Don't fall down.

1028
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Don't fall down.

1029
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I don't know.

1030
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Let's do it one by one.

1031
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's 11.

1032
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You won if you knocked down five.

1033
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I have to knock down five?

1034
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'll do my best.

1035
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'll do it, too.

1036
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Good.

1037
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Let's go home.

1038
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Let's go home.

1039
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Let's go home.

1040
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Let's go home.

1041
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Let's go home.

1042
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
This is a good chance.

1043
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Stand up.

1044
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Stand up.

1045
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Hoshita, you've been bowling and you've been getting pins.

1046
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That's why...

1047
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Matsumoto, who decided on a great excuse, will receive a CD radio from Masaki Entertainment.

1048
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But I'm still winning.

1049
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
What?

1050
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
His eyes...

1051
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Stop it.

1052
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
How many more do you want?

1053
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'm counting on you.

1054
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Three more.

1055
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Three?

1056
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Three?

1057
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Don't fall down.

1058
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's easy to ride.

1059
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's easy to ride.

1060
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's easy to ride.

1061
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
What is it?

1062
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You can take a nap.

1063
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
No.

1064
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Get down.

1065
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
No.

1066
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Why?

1067
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
15 to 10.

1068
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It was close.

1069
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It was close.

1070
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We won.

1071
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We'll give you the director's award and the production director's award.

1072
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Director's award?

1073
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Thank you.

1074
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Thank you.

1075
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We won.

1076
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We lost.

1077
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's a punishment game.

1078
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Get changed.

1079
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Stop going down.

1080
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
What?

1081
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You lost.

1082
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It suits you.

1083
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I envy you.

1084
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Stand up.

1085
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'll give you the ball.

1086
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
There are many things to think about.

1087
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Let's go.

1088
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You!

1089
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're scary.

1090
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Stand up.

1091
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Stand up. I'll go next.

1092
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You're scary.

1093
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm serious.

1094
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You...

1095
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
What?

1096
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You don't know how to be funny.

1097
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm serious.

1098
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Let's go home.

1099
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That's the end of the corner.

1100
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's go home.

1101
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Help me.

1102
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm hungry. Go to the cafeteria and get ramen.

1103
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Run.
