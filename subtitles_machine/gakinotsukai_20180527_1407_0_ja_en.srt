1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tonight, that popular show is back for the first time in 6 months!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The gorgeous guests keep appearing! The mouth-bucket festival, begins!

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Night's mouth-bucket hit studio!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good evening everyone!

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have returned to our fans' love calls.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We will be the MCs this time as well.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you!

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This time too, we have invited a special guest from actors to comedians.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A famous rehearsal was conducted before the recording.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Among them, the most serious man is...

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me see it.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When is it coming?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Check it thoroughly until the end of the cut.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is important.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm wearing it here.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mouth-to-mouth battle.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who will win the crown?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's start with the first mouth-to-mouth singer.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The queen of the Enka Kayo Kai is here like a lion.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Misora Hibari's love 33

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,840
문득子 열면

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:49,600
Ah...

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,520
Love

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,660
With lots of руки,

25
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,960
And skinmans,

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,240
Come together without desire.

27
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,200
Some people are cute.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Thank you very much.

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm already feeling the urge to sing.

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Thank you very much.

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Thank you very much.

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
It was a very emotional song.

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
It's the same as always.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Hibari-san, you received the National Nutrition Award in 1989.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
What kind of products did you receive from the government?

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Ask Kazuya.

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Oh, thank you.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Kazuya-san, you raised Hibari-san as a woman.

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
What was the hardest thing about raising her?

40
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Ask Kazuya.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Ask Kazuya-chan.

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Kaguya!

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
He's not at the studio right now

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Thank you very much

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Thank you very much

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Let's move on to the next mouth-to-mouth singer

47
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
With a bright smile like the sun, the Harajuku gyaru is also here

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Everyone, let's dance together

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Mr. Yosuke Tagawa's Rui Rui

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Rui Rui

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Why are you saying Rui Rui now?

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
He dances a lot

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm hungry.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
He's dancing a lot.

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm getting angry.

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,200
I don't know if I'm in love or not

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm really scared

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I'm going to get lost

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,200
How long will I see this lonely dream?

60
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I'll rub your cheeks

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I want you to understand that this is the end

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Come on, let's dance under the sun

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Come on, let's do the Lui Lui dance

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Take seven steps

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
This is his song

66
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
It's a song

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
It's a song

68
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Today is bye bye

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Look, I met you who is so cute

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm in a good mood, Louis Louis

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Louis Louis

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Wonderful

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Thank you very much

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Thank you very much

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Mr.Tada, please

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
This time, you sang Louis Louis

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
What is the meaning of this word?

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Rui Rui means...

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Thank you

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
It's a word from the other side of Japan

81
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Brazil?

82
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
It's not from Brazil, it's a word from the neighboring country

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It means thank you

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Is it a slang?

85
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
It's a scary word

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's not a slang, it's a slum

87
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Slum is scary

88
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Slum is scary

89
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Slum is not scary

90
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Thank you very much

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Thank you very much. Please take a seat.

92
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Thank you very much.

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Now, let's move on to the next singer.

94
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
A Yankee from Fujisawa who doesn't even cry,

95
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,200
takes a metal bat and hits the rock world with it.

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Mr. Shima Daisuke, the man's award.

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,000
and I could not deliver the song.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Seriously, what is a boring song,

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
a boring song he?

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,300
and I born as a rich boy

101
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,200
How I have USching and-

102
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
I was living believing that

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,340
I heard somehehe

104
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,240
Forget the tears of the past.

105
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,300
Very

106
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,000
life

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Even when I felt like I was being carried away by the weight of time

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I held on to my blue fist

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When I was a child, I was a five-year-old

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was shining in the night sky

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't forget the feelings you felt when you saw the shooting stars

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Even if pulling is the only thing a man can do,

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,800
I believe in this heart and keep on living

114
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,060
The Ventriloquism of every word

115
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,700
Even the bloody and

116
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,480
Thank you.

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,840
Here you are.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Thank you very much

119
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Since I was young, since I was in my teens

120
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
What's up, you idiot?

121
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
It was pretty bad, I was really angry

122
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
It's fine to say it with your tongue, but what kind of bad things did you do?

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,840
That's right, I was really angry at the make-up room

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
What?

125
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
I was angry at the mirror

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
The Rikishi's...

127
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Of course, there's that anger

128
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
There's anger in your heart

129
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
This girl is bad

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
What the hell are you doing?

131
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm Hikari Osaru.

132
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm not doing anything. I'm just standing still.

133
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Hikari is just standing still.

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Let's finish this quickly.

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
You want to finish this?

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
I want to finish everyone.

137
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Thank you very much, Mr. Shimada.

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
It's a little scary.

139
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
It's a little scary.

140
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Let's move on to the next mouth-to-mouth news.

141
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:08,440
In 1973, a student band formed in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, became big and sang a suspiciously fleeting adult love song.

142
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
In a safe place, the heart of Wine Red.

143
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
It's like a movie.

144
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
It's like a movie.

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Ah, is that so?

146
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Really?

147
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
What is this?

148
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
That's good.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
What are you doing?

150
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,440
If you gently hold on to the memories that seem to be forgotten

151
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Rather than forgetting them

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
It's good

153
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,440
I want to love you more than I do now

154
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
It's good, it's good, it's good

155
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,520
How dare you find out his face niin

156
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:29,960
The scene of the

157
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm afraid I'll be out of the picture.

158
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Thank you very much.

159
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
You look like Shinji Hanimura.

160
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I don't know who you are.

161
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm doing it in the Tamaki.

162
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Was your body so wide?

163
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
No, it's with curry.

164
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm going up and up.

165
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
It was a bad mass.

166
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Is he a magician?

167
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
He's not a magician.

168
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,960
What kind of care do you give to keep your voice?

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I give a massage with cola.

170
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Massage with cola?

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
That's pretty stimulating.

172
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:27,220
He's a bit of a

173
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,220
Of course, we didn't accept it at all.

174
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
We confirmed it, so we know.

175
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
We confirmed it, so we saw it.

176
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,220
After this, more and more expensive guests appeared.

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,220
Now, let's move on to the next mouth-to-mouth singer.

178
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,220
The appearance of the king of rock, who became the stronghold of rock believers all over the country.

179
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,220
R.C. Succession's Night in the Afternoon

180
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Who is this?

181
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Who is this?

182
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
The one who is in charge of the current situation

183
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Tsuda-san

184
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,220
The rain of blood has done it

185
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,220
The engine has gone crazy

186
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,220
The fuel tank has been crushed

187
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,220
What's wrong? Hey hey baby

188
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,220
The battery is running out

189
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
The battery is running out

190
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,220
The battery is running out

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
It's not good to be too clean.

192
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
It's better to be more clean.

193
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
It's better to be more clean.

194
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,220
He's not moving at all.

195
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
He's not moving at all.

196
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:58,220
I can't get on you on a night like this

197
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,220
I can't let you go on a night like this

198
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
There's no one to call, right?

199
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
The best!

200
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm doing it at a store.

201
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Thank you very much!

202
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Thank you very much!

203
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
It was very impressive.

204
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
Thank you very much.

205
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
I was able to see a wonderful performance.

206
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,220
I heard that Tomokazu Miura was a high school classmate.

207
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Yes, yes, yes.

208
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
I heard that.

209
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
That's right.

210
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Since then, I've been...

211
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
I'm not sure if I should say this.

212
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
I used to go home with him on my bike.

213
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
It was 100 points.

214
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,220
The song is still that, but the deep part of the talk is...

215
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
You can still go on.

216
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Really?

217
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
There is a favorite food.

218
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
What do you usually eat?

219
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
It's Koya tofu.

220
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Koya tofu?

221
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
No.

222
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
A little...

223
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
You think too much.

224
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Suddenly Koya tofu.

225
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Do you often watch TV?

226
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
I watch it a lot!

227
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Is there a show you like?

228
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
From the world's president!

229
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
Ah, no.

230
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
There's no such thing as wrong.

231
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
There's no such thing as wrong.

232
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
What's wrong?

233
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
What's wrong?

234
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
What's wrong?

235
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Thank you very much!

236
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Congratulations on your new seat!

237
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
Why are you crying?

238
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
Why are you crying?

239
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Next, let's hear the next one.

240
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,220
The main character of the national film has appeared.

241
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,220
He sings along with the famous lines that everyone knows.

242
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Kiyoshi Atsumi's, The Man is Sorrowful.

243
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,220
I was born and raised in Shibamata, Katsushika.

244
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:14,220
My dear brother, I want to be a great brother who will make you happy someday

245
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,220
Without the meaning of struggle and effort

246
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Today, the day of tears

247
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:37,220
The sun of the sun is falling

248
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:56,220
I want to ask you about director Yohji Yamada. What kind of person is he usually?

249
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,220
I like occult, so I told him about aliens.

250
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Oh, really?

251
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I always say that I made the mystery circle.

252
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,220
I blew it up.

253
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,220
You blew up Yamada Yoshi?

254
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
You guys are all rough.

255
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
Oh, I see.

256
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Do you two from downtown and Matsumoto-san have a co-star?

257
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Do we?

258
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
Long time ago, we only met once.

259
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
What program did you appear on?

260
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,220
In a local program in Kanagawa,

261
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
I was riding a bike

262
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,220
and I was on a show called Tofu shop

263
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,220
I got lost in the middle of the show

264
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Then, the staff didn't come at all

265
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
So I went home

266
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,220
I didn't want them to apologize

267
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,220
But I thought I would have to do something called a ritual

268
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
A ritual?

269
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
Not a ritual

270
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
It's a ritual, you idiot!

271
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,220
It's a ritual, right?

272
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
Am I allowed to do it?

273
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
Ah, it's gone.

274
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
No, that one was...

275
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
What is this?

276
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
Is this the end?

277
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
What is this?

278
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,220
After this, that hit song will be a hit!

279
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,220
Now, let's move on to the next song.

280
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,220
A miracle middle-aged man who became the Japanese singer with millions of hits in a row.

281
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Utada Hikaru's Traveling.

282
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,220
Oh, was it hit in?

283
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
Oh, doggo dog.

284
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,080
He must becemos to the point of Danny's

285
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Oh doggy...

286
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,220
I'm getting a voice in my head

287
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,220
I'm going to accept you

288
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,220
I'm going to stop

289
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,220
I don't want to be true

290
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
I'm trapped in the wind

291
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
I'm climbing up the moon

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,220
My moon is next to you

293
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Suddenly, I'm back to myself

294
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,220
The star of my dreams

295
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Traveling, I'll take you

296
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,220
Traveling, to the place where the whole world gathers

297
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Traveling, from here to there

298
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,220
I'll take you

299
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:27,380
Tatara Tatara Tatara Tatara Tatara Tatara Tatara

300
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,880
Uo-oh

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Thank you very much

302
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Thank you very much

303
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Please come this way

304
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
It's very big

305
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
It's this big?

306
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
It's big, it's big

307
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
It's big

308
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,880
There was a story about a man in Italy who got divorced

309
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Can I ask the truth about this?

310
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
He lost his kiss.

311
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Really?

312
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Is it important?

313
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
I used to have a kiss.

314
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,880
I don't know what to say.

315
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
I lost my kiss.

316
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,880
He can't hear.

317
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Where do you meet an Italian man?

318
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
There is a drinking party in Italy.

319
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
In Italy?

320
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Yes, there is.

321
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Those who are really experts are gathered.

322
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
I don't like these experts.

323
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
It happens regularly.

324
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
It's a happening party.

325
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
It's not a happening party.

326
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
It's a drinking party.

327
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I don't know.

328
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Zen is not in it.

329
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Zen is not in it.

330
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
It's a little embarrassing.

331
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Stop it!

332
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It's a story from before!

333
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
I don't want to say it anymore.

334
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
I want to say it.

335
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm really going to get the car ready.

336
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,880
The amount of sweat is really...

337
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Is that so?

338
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
It's like a trap inside.

339
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Really!

340
00:21:04,880 --> 00:20:46,880
After that, that popular comedian will be

341
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
I don't want to say it anymore. I want to go home.

342
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm already in the car.

343
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,880
The amount of sweat is really...

344
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Is that so?

345
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
It's like a trap inside.

346
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
After that, that popular comedian will be forever silent.

347
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Let's move on to the next silent scene.

348
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Sometimes actress, sometimes singer.

349
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
The miracle of Taiwan given by heaven is coming tonight.

350
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
It's being shown by Judy Long.

351
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
It's ugly!

352
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,820
MUT mobile isn't the main end is it?

353
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
A TV program, you started as a TV director now?

354
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Still don't understand Japanese?

355
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
It's an old lady!

356
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
There's an old lady like this!

357
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
An old lady doing a speech!

358
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
It's an old lady!

359
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
There's an old lady like this!

360
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
She's a woman who lived in a park.

361
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll be waiting for you

362
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Please come back to me

363
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
The wind is blowing from the sky

364
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
We are here

365
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Oh, it's a smile

366
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Smile

367
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Smile, smile

368
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,880
The last part of the song is the most important part.

369
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
It's very elegant.

370
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
It's cool.

371
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
The last part.

372
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
It's ugly.

373
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
It's dirty.

374
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
Thank you very much.

375
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
It's wonderful.

376
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Thank you very much.

377
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,880
I heard that you had a good relationship with Yujiro Ichihara.

378
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
What kind of person is Yujiro?

379
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Yujiro is fast to move.

380
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Fast to move?

381
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Yes.

382
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
He is impatient.

383
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
He is impatient.

384
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
He is like, let's go to the next one.

385
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Yes, yes.

386
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Why is it one-sided?

387
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Recently, he hasn't been talking, so I forgot a little.

388
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Ah!

389
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
He hasn't been talking much recently.

390
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Yes, yes.

391
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
This is strange.

392
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
What do you think?

393
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
He is a bit ugly.

394
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Isn't it ugly?

395
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Shimo-san and the others are saying that he is ugly.

396
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Isn't it normal?

397
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
I don't know.

398
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
I think it's normal.

399
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
It's like a normal meal.

400
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
The second half of the G-Series mouth-to-mouth battle!

401
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Really?

402
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Mouth-to-mouth monsters are appearing one after another!

403
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
The winner is...

404
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Dragon...

405
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,380
So amazing, Romultan!
