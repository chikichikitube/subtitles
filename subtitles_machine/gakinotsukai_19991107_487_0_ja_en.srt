1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Shiku Kekkon Kose-Sakka Ryusen Hichi Hengen!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, yes, yes.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is a very special time.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
After all, this Kotobuki...

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a celebration, isn't it?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This person must do it too.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's what's going on.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, yes, yes.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Last week, at the meeting, when that story came out,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I suddenly stopped talking.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It was a reaction that could only be called the first point.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I see.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's have him appear.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Good morning.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good morning.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The results so far...

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see, I see.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Kogoriko's Tanaka is the best.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thank you very much.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's amazing.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's amazing.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And Kose-Sakka.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're Kose-Sakka this time, right?

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's Takasu?

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The person who does the best in the back is...

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right.

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's the result.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't think you'll get this.

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't get it.

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

37
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Right now, luck is coming.

38
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right, that's right.

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm really nervous.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know what's funny.

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Everyone's face is dark.

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's a strange thing.

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everyone's eyes are dark.

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's right.

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone's mouth is dark.

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

47
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What should we do?

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hmm...

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey...

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tohba?

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's Tohba?

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Fujiwara is amazing.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
His swimming is really good.

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's really funny.

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
His butterfly is really funny.

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What do you think of the people's vote?

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yamasaki needs to be used as a kid.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is necessary.

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you do it yourself, you can do it.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you do it yourself, you can do it.

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why are you so angry?

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know why you're angry.

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't like it when you don't like it.

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
To be honest, I've been bored of it for two years.

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I want you to get married.

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want you to get married.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not angry.

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's a daughter's vacation.

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm having fun.

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come.

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good, good, good.

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Nice and slow.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good, good, good.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,500
That's it.

78
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Come on, let's go.

79
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Come on, come on, come on.

80
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Come on, come on.

81
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
There, there, there, there.

82
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Come on, let's go.

83
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm not going to take this home with me.

84
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm going to use it for my training.

85
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,500
The first half is similar, but the second half is getting more and more similar.

86
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:31,500
The first half is going to be a little more interesting.

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
It's not going to be so very natural.

88
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,500
It's not something you see on TV.

89
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,500
What should I do?

91
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I wonder if I should put something on it.

92
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It's cold.

93
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm starting to feel cold.

94
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I wonder if the fangs will come off.

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Maybe I should stop using fangs.

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I can draw eyes.

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
But I can't draw hands.

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I always forget to draw an item.

99
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
It was a little funny.

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
You did a good job.

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I did a good job.

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I wonder if I should put something on it.

103
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
You did a good job.

104
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
What should I do?

105
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I don't have a microphone.

106
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I have three weeks.

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
What should I do?

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm scared.

109
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I have 282,000 yen.

110
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I don't have money.

111
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I don't have money.

112
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I don't have money.

113
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm going to draw a cross.

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I wonder if I should put something on it.

115
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm done.

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm done.

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I had a good look.

118
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I had a good look.

119
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I had a good look.

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
I should have something.

121
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,500
It doesn't matter who it is.

122
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm the boss.

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I'll have milk tea.

124
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm the boss.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I'll have a drink.

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm the boss.

127
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm the boss.

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'll have a drink.

129
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm the boss.

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:03,500
What? What about gravure?

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
He's definitely doing it.

132
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
It's getting late.

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Do you want to have dinner again?

134
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Horime-chan, good work.

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Thank you.

137
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
You did well today.

138
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I was going to pay you back for today's gala.

139
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Can I pay you back as a gamer?

140
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
That's right.

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I was going to pay you back for today's gala.

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm going to pay you back as a gamer.

143
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I'll give you a job as soon as possible.

144
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
I'll give you a job as soon as possible.

145
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Takahashi.

146
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Yes.

147
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I'll give you a job as a gamer.

148
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Don't do that.

149
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Don't do that.

150
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll give you a job as a gamer.

151
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I'll give you a job as a gamer.

152
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
But he's the director.

153
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
He doesn't follow the rules.

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
He's a villain.

155
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
He used to be an old entertainer.

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
He used to be an old entertainer.

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
I'll give you a job as a gamer.

158
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I can't move my body.

159
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I can't move my body.

160
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I can't move my body.

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I can't move my body.

162
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I'm cold.

163
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I can't move my body.

164
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I want to do it again.

165
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Let's do it again.

166
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
It's really long.

167
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
It's really long.

168
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
It's really long.

169
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
It's really long.

170
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
It's really long.

171
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
This is nice.

172
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Good morning.

173
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Good morning.

174
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Hello.

175
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Sorry, I'm late from Matsumoto.

176
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Sorry, I'm late from Matsumoto.

177
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I'll get in after 15 minutes.

178
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I'll get in after 15 minutes.

179
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
I'll get in after 15 minutes.

180
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,480
Yes.

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,480
No.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,480
No.

183
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,480
No.

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,480
No.

185
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,480
I'll say it.

186
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,480
Yes.

187
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,480
What is it?

188
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,480
What is it?

189
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,480
That is...

190
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,480
Yes.

191
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,460
What is it?

192
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,460
I think it will be done in 30 minutes.

193
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,460
No, I understand that.

194
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,460
What is it?

195
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,460
Yes.

196
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,460
If you can do it with Mr. Tsukasa.

197
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,460
I understand that.

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,460
No, I understand that.

199
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,460
No, I understand that.

200
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,460
No way.

201
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,460
No way.

202
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,460
No way.

203
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,440
No way.

204
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,440
No way.

205
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,440
It was the last 7th time, so I didn't think it would end like this.

206
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,440
It was amazing.

207
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,440
Now, we will do the final calculation.

208
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,440
He's saying it very well.

209
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,440
There were 2 dirty ones.

210
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,440
Dirty ones.

211
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,440
If I say it again, Tanaka Kogoriko is the champion with 40,000 yen.

212
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,440
The final calculation has been made.

213
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,420
Who will be the winner?

214
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,420
44,000 yen.

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,420
That's amazing.

216
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,420
Congratulations.

217
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,420
That's amazing.

218
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,420
Whose power is this?

219
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,420
Who will be the winner?

220
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:50,400
Yōkan Kusai wa Nakayoshi da Itsumo Futari de Mitsuyōkan

221
00:11:50,420 --> 00:12:01,400
Yōkan no Tanna Yōkan no Yome Yoru wa Kuriyōkan

222
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,400
Good evening.

223
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,400
Good evening.

224
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,400
Good evening.

225
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,400
Good evening.

226
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,400
Good evening.

227
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,400
It's a little late.

228
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,400
Yes.

229
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,380
It's a little late.

230
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,380
I'm looking at you.

231
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,380
I'm looking at you.

232
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,380
I can't help it. I'm not feeling well.

233
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,380
Why?

234
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,380
I can't help it. I'm not feeling well.

235
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,380
Why?

236
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,380
I thought about it last night.

237
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,380
If I say this, you might think I'm weird.

238
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,380
It's okay if you don't say that.

239
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,380
Don't you think I should quit smoking?

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,380
That's right.

241
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,380
It's annoying.

242
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,360
It's annoying.

243
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm not using any health equipment.

244
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,360
It's just stupid work.

245
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:57,360
You eat it, you light it, you inhale it, you exhale it, you erase it, you eat it, you light it, you inhale it, you exhale it, you shoot it.

246
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,360
I wonder what you're doing.

247
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't like that work, so I should quit.

248
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,340
It's getting hard to inhale, and I'm getting angry, so I'm going to quit.

249
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,340
I'm going to quit, so you quit.

250
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,340
Wait a minute.

251
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,340
I'm getting angry.

252
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,340
Wait a minute.

253
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,340
What?

254
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,340
Why me?

255
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,340
You said something like you wanted to quit.

256
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,340
That's right. I don't like that kind of work.

257
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,340
How many packs do you smoke a day?

258
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,340
About two packs.

259
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,340
About two packs. I smoke about two packs at least.

260
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,320
There are times when I get angry.

261
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,320
I see.

262
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,320
Think about it.

263
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,320
I've smoked before.

264
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,320
Now I'm going to smoke.

265
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,320
On the contrary, I'm going to try to smoke.

266
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,320
I've been smoking for about five years.

267
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,320
My eyes are like this.

268
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,320
It's not a cigarette.

269
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,320
My eyes hurt.

270
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,320
My eyes hurt.

271
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,320
I haven't been smoked.

272
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,300
It's okay. If you're going to quit, you have to say it out loud.

273
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,300
You can't quit.

274
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,300
I see.

275
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,300
Say it here.

276
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,300
It's not true.

277
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,300
I think ordinary people can quit.

278
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,300
But you might think I'm going to get angry again.

279
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,300
Don't pretend to be angry.

280
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,280
I have a lot of bad habits.

281
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,280
You can bring it to me.

283
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,280
You have a lot of bad habits.

284
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,280
You can bring it to me.

285
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,280
You can say it here.

286
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,280
You have to say it out loud.

287
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,280
You can say, don't bring it to me.

288
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,260
Just say it.

289
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,260
If you quit.

290
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,260
Why?

291
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,260
Because you are the leader of downtown.

292
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,260
Who is the leader?

293
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,260
If you quit, I might quit too.

294
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,260
For the time being, you should quit.

295
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,260
This recording is the last cigarette.

296
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,260
I'm going to smoke.

297
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,260
Why me?

298
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,260
Please.

299
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,260
I'm not confident.

300
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,260
Why?

301
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,240
Because you are the leader.

302
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,240
No.

303
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,240
I'm not confident.

304
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,240
Because you are the leader.

305
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,240
I'm not confident.

306
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,240
I smoke at home.

307
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,240
I don't want to bother anyone.

308
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,240
If you smoke at home, children will smoke.

309
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,240
They will smoke next to you.

310
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,220
Think about the future of your children.

311
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,220
Think about the future of your children.

312
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,220
I will use it three times.

313
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,220
Don't do that.

314
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,220
Don't do that.

315
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,220
You are a very good person.

316
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,220
Really.

317
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,220
Think about that.

318
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,220
I'm not a good person.

319
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,220
Don't smoke.

320
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,220
No.

321
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,220
Then.

322
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,220
Then.

323
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,220
From today, I smoke as long as I drink.

324
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,200
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,200
That's why you are a non-smoker.

326
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,200
What are you talking about?

327
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,200
I will never smoke again.

328
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,200
Please don't smoke again.

329
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,200
Don't do that.

330
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,200
I told you to do it.

331
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,200
I don't want to do it.

332
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,200
But as I said earlier,

333
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,200
We have been laughed at for 10 years.

334
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,200
We have been laughed at for 10 years.

335
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,180
But we are a non-smoker.

336
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,180
We have been laughed at.

337
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,180
But I have been laughed at.

338
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,180
I have a lot of hair.

339
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,180
I am not a non-smoker.

340
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,180
I smoke a lot.

341
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,180
That's why you smoke.

342
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,180
That's why you smoke.

343
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,180
I am not a non-smoker.

344
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,180
Don't smoke again.

345
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,180
Don't smoke again.

346
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,180
Don't smoke again.

347
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,180
Don't smoke again.

348
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,180
The end.

349
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,180
I have a question for the beautiful-looking Matsumoto-san.

350
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
Yes, yes.

351
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,180
What is the meaning of Cosmetics Salon's Cosmetics?

352
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,180
I have studied a lot of English.

353
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,180
It's called Profile, right?

354
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,180
It's like Japanese English.

355
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,180
Do you know what that means?

356
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,180
It means side face.

357
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:41,180
What is the meaning of Cosmetics Salon's Cosmetics?

358
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Do you often hear Cosmetics Salon?

359
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Yes, I do.

360
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,180
What is the meaning of Cosmetics Salon's Cosmetics?

361
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Say it in your head.

362
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,180
You won't get it anyway.

363
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,180
Don't talk like a fool.

364
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,180
I want to hear your opinion.

365
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Cosmetics Salon.

366
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
Do you know what it means?

367
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,180
It means beauty, right?

368
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,180
I don't know what it means.

369
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Let me hear your opinion.

370
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,180
What is the meaning of Cosmetics Salon's Cosmetics?

371
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Say it in your head.

372
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,180
It means side face.

373
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Or it means beautiful face.

374
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,180
What is Cosmetics Salon?

375
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,180
It means the beauty of side face.

376
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Are you kidding me?

377
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
That's good.

378
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
I was surprised.

379
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,180
Cosmetics.

380
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
What is the meaning of Cosmetics Salon's Cosmetics?

381
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,180
It means romantic.

382
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
Don't talk like a fool.

383
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Say it in your head.

384
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
I have to think about the meaning of Cosmetics Salon's Cosmetics Salon.

385
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Cosmetics Salon means like.

386
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,180
You know, I'm a bit like a Yakuza.

387
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
I'm a bit shiny.

388
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,180
I'm a bit like a Yankee.

389
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Tic means like.

390
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Like.

391
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Like what?

392
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Like a couple.

393
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
You can say that as Tic.

394
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
You can say that as Tic.

395
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
You can say that as Tic.

396
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,180
So if you know Cosmetics Salon,

397
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
Tic means like that.

398
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
So what is Cosmetics Salon?

399
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
It means like that.

400
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Do you understand?

401
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
If you don't understand.

402
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
If you don't understand.

403
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,180
If you don't understand, tell me.

404
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Cosmetics means...

405
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Half-open.

406
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Half-open?

407
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Half-open.

408
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,180
It's like the door of Cosmetics Salon is open.

409
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
It's like half-open.

410
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,180
Half-open.

411
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
I don't understand this Salon at all.

412
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Can you tell me about the Salon?

413
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,180
It doesn't matter if it's a store.

414
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
What?

415
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,180
Is that so?

416
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,180
Half-open.

417
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Half-open.

418
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Half-open.

419
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
Half-open.

420
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
I don't know what kind of store it is.

421
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
Half-open.

422
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Cosmetics Salon.

423
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
I don't know the meaning of half-open.

424
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
What's inside?

425
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
Don't ask me that.

426
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Why?

427
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
It doesn't matter if it's a curry shop or udon shop.

428
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,180
If it's half-open, it's Cosmetics Salon.

429
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,180
If it's half-open, it's Cosmetics Salon.

430
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
If it's half-open, it's Cosmetics Salon.

431
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
If it's half-open, it's Cosmetics Salon.

432
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,180
If it's half-open, it's Cosmetics Salon.

433
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,180
Matsumoto-san, you have successfully overcome your baldness.

434
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Please tell us the real reason why people are bald.

435
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
You have successfully overcome your baldness.

436
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Really.

437
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
You can't overcome your baldness?

438
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I really did my best.

439
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Everyone is trying hard to overcome their baldness.

440
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:25,180
There are many scholars who say that it's because of stress and lack of sleep.

441
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,180
But I know that the real reason is not because of that.

442
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
Really?

443
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
Some kind of stress is really stress.

444
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
But the meaning is different.

445
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Let's be clear.

446
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,180
There is no such thing as baldness in this world.

447
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
There is no such thing.

448
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
There isn't.

449
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
There are a lot of bald people.

450
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Do you think so?

451
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,180
For example, let's say you see someone and think that they are a little bald.

452
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
But in reality, there are no bald people.

453
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
It's the stress of seeing them.

454
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
What do you mean?

455
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
It's obvious that you are bald.

456
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
You don't have hair.

457
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,180
You look like that because you are tired.

458
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,180
That's not true.

459
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,180
No matter what anyone says, the original Fuyuki is bald.

460
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,180
When you see the original Fuyuki, you look like that because you are tired.

461
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,180
When you see the original Fuyuki, you look like that because you are tired.

462
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
That's not true.

463
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
No one is bald.

464
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
This is a little thin.

465
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Onuma!

466
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Onuma!

467
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Onuma!

468
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,180
Onuma!

469
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Onuma!

470
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Come here!

471
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,180
That's what I mean.

472
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
I want to say that it's the responsibility of the viewer.

473
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,180
That's not true.

474
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
No matter what anyone says, the original Fuyuki is bald.

475
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
Yokoyama Noc is bald, right?

476
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
No, that's not true.

477
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,180
If you look at the original Fuyuki, it's not bald at all.

478
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
That's not true.

479
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Onuma, come here!

480
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
This is bald.

481
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,180
This is bald.

482
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,180
That's not true.

483
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
Onuma!

484
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Onuma!

485
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Onuma!

486
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
That's not true.

487
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
That's not true.

488
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,180
That's not true.

489
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
That's why you have a problem.

490
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
Really.

491
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
How about the one who is wearing a wig?

492
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
What?

493
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
There is no one who is wearing a wig.

494
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
You are wearing a wig!

495
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
Who is?

496
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,180
Who is wearing a wig?

497
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,180
For example, who is wearing a wig?

498
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,180
Did I misunderstand?

499
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
That's right.

500
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
There is a misunderstanding.

501
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,180
Donmai! Donmai!

502
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,180
