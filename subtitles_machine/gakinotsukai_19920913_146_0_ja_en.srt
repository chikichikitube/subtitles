1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Jiraiya!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Matsu!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ichira!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's fight!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are still beginners.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's almost done.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm telling you to do your best, but you can't sell it to an entertainer.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can't sell it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Mr. Akashiya, Mr. Akashiya.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Last year, he earned 300 million yen a year.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's amazing.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Mr. Katsura earned 100 million yen a year.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's amazing.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. Okue.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Last year's annual income was 50 pesos.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
50 pesos?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's Mexican currency.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sorry, sorry.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No, no, no.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, no, no.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think the entertainer can't sell it.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No matter what you say, the car he's driving is amazing.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's amazing if it sells.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, I see.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you know what Mr. Masao Sen is driving?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Rolls Royce.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wow, this is amazing.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you know what Mr. Katsura is driving?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Ferrari.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Supercar.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can't be surprised by that.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Botan of Chaos Botan.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The car you're driving is a fire truck.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The air conditioner is on.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, what's wrong with you today?

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be angry with me.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't be angry with me.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If I sell it, don't take it.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're right.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
After all, if you sell it.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What do you want to do?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm good at singing, so I want to release a record.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're good at singing?

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can you sing?

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can sing, leave it to me.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's your favorite number 18?

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Nakajou's lie.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Mr. Nakajou's lie.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then let's have the guests listen to it today.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Please listen to it.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then, Hama-chan.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll play the accompaniment.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We'll play the accompaniment.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Please go to the back and get ready.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you for waiting.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jimmy Onishi will sing.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. Nakajou's lie.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Jimmy Onishi's lie.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Jimmy Onishi's lie.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where did you come in from?

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Where did you come in from?

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What did you say?

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Where did you come in from?

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It was a little hard to understand.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't understand.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I was confused because I did it alone.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll do it alone next time.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's the only one who can dance.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll leave it to you.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Jimmy Onishi's lie.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's me.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How can you sing?

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How can you sing?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought you were a singer and a singer-songwriter.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's get it right.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It won't work if we do more.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll do my best next time.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's get it right.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll show you next time.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
眞

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Jimmy Onishi's lie.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Jimmy Onishi's lie.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,040
Thank you.

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Thank you.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Thank you very much.

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Happy birthday to Hitoshi.

99
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Well, it's every year.

100
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Thank you very much.

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Well, it's every year.

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Well, it's every year.

103
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Well, I've been doing a lot of songs.

104
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Compared to CX, it's pretty good.

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
It's pretty good.

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Well, it's every year.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
It's pretty good.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Can you say something?

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Yes.

110
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Well, it's the second time.

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I don't have anything to say.

112
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Thank you very much.

113
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Well, it's getting cooler.

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,040
I have to work a little harder.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
What's with your attitude?

116
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
What?

117
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
What?

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I hit my ass.

119
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
You hit your ass.

120
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I'll do it a little more.

121
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,040
You're going to shave your beard.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Why do you shave your beard?

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
I can't help it if I don't shave my beard.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,040
If you have time before the show, you can do that.

125
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,040
You can't decide the turn when you come out.

126
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm 29 years old.

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
You're already old.

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I don't know how long you've been doing this.

129
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
I've come to a difficult place.

130
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Why?

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I'll be 32 years old in two or three years.

132
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't you think it's a little too much?

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Is that so?

134
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
It's a little too much.

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm glad you quit school at that time.

136
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
That's the right answer.

137
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
I think that's the right answer.

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
You're a ninja.

139
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm not a ninja.

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
You're not.

141
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
You're a ninja.

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
You're a ninja.

143
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
You're still alive.

144
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm flying.

145
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm a ninja.

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Ninjas don't show their faces.

147
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
You're showing your face.

148
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
It's hard, isn't it?

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
What do you call this?

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Snap.

151
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
This is still the city.

152
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I know.

153
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Is that so?

154
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Why do you keep pushing your mouth?

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
You're dirty.

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,040
There's a demon with a P, right?

157
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,040
If you move your mouth, you can see what it looks like.

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I was told clearly.

159
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,040
That idiot.

160
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I told you.

161
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,040
You were telling someone on TV today.

162
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I wasn't telling anyone.

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
You were telling someone.

164
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Don't say that.

165
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
I've never changed.

166
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm not resting.

167
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm not resting.

168
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,040
What are you going to do with me?

169
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Did you run away when you woke up that morning?

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I think about it when I'm moving.

171
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I think about it when I'm moving.

172
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Why?

173
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
For example, when I'm on TV.

174
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
When I was in Osaka.

175
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm running all the time.

176
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I suddenly think.

177
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Where am I going?

178
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
At 3 o'clock.

179
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
At 3 o'clock.

180
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Why?

181
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Why do you do that?

182
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
What?

183
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I saw your reaction in Kobe.

184
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,040
I can't go because I'm resting.

185
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
I have no choice but to run away.

186
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I've been marked.

187
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Marked?

188
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,040
My chief manager, Hiroshi Ozaki.

189
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
He said he wanted to rest.

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040
I don't know if he went to Okayama or somewhere else.

191
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
I went to buy a cigarette.

192
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I went to buy a cigarette.

193
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Where are you going?

194
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm going to buy a cigarette.

195
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Where are you going?

196
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Don't sweat.

197
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I'm in the same state.

198
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
That's good.

199
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Everyone is fooling around.

200
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Who are you talking about?

201
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Him? Her?

202
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
No, no, no.

203
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
It's amazing.

204
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
I don't work.

205
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Who?

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I don't work.

207
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Who?

208
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,040
No, no, no.

209
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
You're going somewhere.

210
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm going to Canada.

211
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm the most angry.

212
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
What?

213
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Who?

214
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Why?

215
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm tired.

216
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I can't sleep for a week or two.

217
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm just asking for a break.

218
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
No, no, no.

219
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm serious.

220
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
How many weeks is that period?

221
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Why don't you rest?

222
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
You're doing a show on vacation.

223
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,040
When I see him, I'm sure he's doing a ballpoint pen like this.

224
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
That's when you're listening to people.

225
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm talking to you.

226
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,040
That's like us.

227
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
That's hard.

228
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
They're always like this.

229
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Don't talk about peace.

230
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
No, no, no.

231
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
It's hard.

232
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I had to do something.

233
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
I have to find a healthier way.

234
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
A healthier way?

235
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
It's easy, isn't it?

236
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
We talk a lot like this.

237
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
I'm sure I'll have a stomachache when I get home.

238
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
It's not easy.

239
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
I have a bad throat.

240
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,040
How much do you talk in this hour?

241
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
When I went to the doctor, I was told that I had a weird migraine.

242
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Migraine is twice as much as a person.

243
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Why don't you cut it?

244
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,040
If you cut it, it's going to be a big deal.

245
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
How is it going to be a big deal?

246
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
If you cut it, you'll get a lot of heat.

247
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
This is one of the factors.

248
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Is that so?

249
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,040
If you become an adult and cut a ballpoint pen, you'll get more than 40 degrees of heat.

250
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
That's right.

251
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,040
And when you beat that 40-degree heat, you'll never have to worry about a ballpoint pen again.

252
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
But the problem is when you lose.

253
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
What if I lose?

254
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
It's going to be a big deal.

255
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
So what's going to happen?

256
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,040
The 40-degree heat won't go down for a week or two.

257
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
What if it doesn't go down?

258
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
It's going to be a big deal.

259
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
So what's going to happen?

260
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,040
I know it's going to be a big deal, so what's going to happen?

261
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
The stars are beautiful.

262
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,040
What are you talking about?

263
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
You know what?

264
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Crash!

265
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Really?

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,040
And the other thing is...

267
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,040
You'll become a seedless bomber.

268
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,040
If you don't become a seedless, you'll become a bomber.

269
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Explain that to me.

270
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
No, I'm sorry.

271
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Seedless bomber.

272
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
What's a bomber?

273
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Are you serious?

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,040
If you become an otaku, you'll become a seedless bomber.

275
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
You can't call me a bomber.

276
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Are you serious?

277
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
If you become an otaku, you'll become a seedless bomber.

278
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
It's the same as that.

279
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
That's right.

280
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
You'll evaporate.

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Evaporate?

282
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
That's right.

283
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
You'll evaporate.

284
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
The heat will go up.

285
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Evaporate?

286
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,040
No, really.

287
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
What?

288
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
I'm serious.

289
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
You'll disappear.

290
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
That's a seedless.

291
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
What?

292
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
This is the most troublesome thing.

293
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
This is what I'm most afraid of.

294
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
That's why I don't do it.

295
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
You'll become a seedless bomber.

296
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
You'll become a seedless bomber.

297
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
I thought it was different.

298
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
You'll become a seedless bomber.

299
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
You'll become a seedless bomber.

300
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
That's the most troublesome thing.

301
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
That's the most troublesome thing.

302
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
That's right.

303
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
This is...

304
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
You'll become an old man.

305
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
But I don't like it.

306
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
You won't be able to use it anymore.

307
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
No, no, no.

308
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I want to be a seedless bomber for the rest of my life.

309
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
That's your age and physical strength.

310
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
If you keep doing that, you won't become a seedless bomber.

311
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll definitely keep it.

312
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I'm still a little worried that I won't be able to do it.

313
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Is that so?

314
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,040
You won't be able to do it?

315
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
You won't be able to do it?

316
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I won't.

317
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
You're really something.

318
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
You won't be able to do it.

319
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Or maybe it's because your opponent is a man.

320
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Why?

321
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Don't say scary things!

322
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
You!

323
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Really...

324
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
It's nothing.

325
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
It's nothing.

326
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
You know, recently...

327
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
What?

328
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
It's getting cooler.

329
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
It's getting cooler.

330
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
It's getting easier to live.

331
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
It's easier to live.

332
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,040
But you know, you keep saying that there's not enough water.

333
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes, yes, yes.

334
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
How about this lack of water?

335
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
How about it?

336
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,040
You say that once every few years.

337
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,040
But I hear that when you use water in a rough way, it causes an air-raid.

338
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
You keep saying that there's not enough water.

339
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Don't waste it.

340
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Don't waste it.

341
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Even when you appear on TV, there are idiots who call you.

342
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,040
If you say things like that, I'm going to call the police.

343
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,040
There are a lot of people who watch TV wondering if there's anything they can do.

344
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
That's why you keep saying things like that.

345
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Why do you keep saying things like that?

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,040
If you abuse animals, you get a lot of calls.

347
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,040
But why don't you use monkeys?

348
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
You're forcing yourself to use them.

349
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,040
But I don't take care of them properly.

350
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,040
There's that guy.

351
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
He's a terrible guy.

352
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,040
He has a big mouth like a dragon.

353
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,040
He's got a nice voice.

354
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
He's got a nice voice.

355
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
He's got a nice voice.

356
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
He's got a nice voice.

357
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
He's got a nice voice.

358
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
He's got a nice voice.

359
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
He's got a nice voice.

360
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,040
That's why you're scaring me.

361
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,040
He smiles a lot when he's on television.

362
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
If he says things though about a lion, it's a mess.

363
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,040
That's why it's scary.

364
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
That's why it's scary.

365
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
踩ろョネOut of the lion's mouth fixed.

366
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,040
jinX

367
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
You'll see later.

368
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,040
jinX

369
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Your words are more annoying than your face!

370
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Really!

371
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
In your mouth, you're so stubborn!

372
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
I'm so stubborn!

373
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
You know it!

374
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
You're so stubborn!

375
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Don't cry!

376
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I'll hold you!

377
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Don't cry!

378
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Don't cry!

379
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I'll hold you!

380
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
What a quiet girl!

381
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Idiot!

382
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Really!

383
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
It's his fault!

384
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
What?

385
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
It's not like that!

386
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
It's not like that!

387
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Gah!

388
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
She scratches and goes gah!

389
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Gah!

390
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
She goes gah!

391
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
And I'm sitting on the floor, she goes gah!

392
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Gah!

393
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Gah!

394
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
And she goes gah!

395
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
And I'm on the floor, she goes gah!

396
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
So she can't run away?

397
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
So she can't run away?

398
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
She smacks my face, she goes gah!

399
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
And she goes like this.

400
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
It really scared me.

401
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
When you say that,

402
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
I dyed my hair with dye.

403
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
I dyed my hair with dye!

404
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I dyed it with dye!

405
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
With a string!

406
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
So that I wouldn't run away!

407
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
So that you wouldn't run away!

408
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Don't do it together, Salto!

409
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
In my room, there's a French doll.

410
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Oh, that's good.

411
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,040
It's not such a silly letter.

412
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Are you bragging?

413
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
No, I'm not.

414
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
There's a French doll.

415
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
About two weeks ago, it wasn't a big deal.

416
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
But about three or four days ago,

417
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,040
when I went into my bed, the French doll moved.

418
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,040
When I looked at it, there was blood coming out of my head.

419
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
My hair was a little wet.

420
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Stop it!

421
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Isn't that just your way of saying things?

422
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,040
There's a ghost in my room.

423
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
What?

424
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
That's what I said.

425
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
That's not good.

426
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
It's not good?

427
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
It was written by someone I couldn't trust.

428
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Really?

429
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
But even if I was sleeping alone,

430
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,040
I still couldn't see the doll blood.

431
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Yeah.

432
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
You're scary!

433
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Even if there's a doll,

434
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,040
what kind of doll do you have in your room?

435
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
What?

436
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Do you have a doll in your room?

437
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Do you have a doll in your room?

438
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
What are you doing?

439
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
It's not a doll.

440
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
It's something that swells.

441
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Stop it!

442
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Everyone's scared of that.

443
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
I'm not scared.

444
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
I'm not scared at all.

445
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
No.

446
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,040
There's something like a dog's fur coat.

447
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Everyone's scared of that.

448
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Don't you feel like you're going to move?

449
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I don't think so.

450
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
What are you going to do at home?

451
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Before you go to bed,

452
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,040
you suddenly go like this.

453
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,040
I don't think I can do that.

454
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I was going to go to bed,

455
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
but I happened to see a doll.

456
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Thank you for your hard work.

457
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Are you scared?

458
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
What are you going to do if you're told that?

459
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
You can't tell anyone.

460
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
You're a hard person.

461
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
If you tell anyone, they'll think you're stupid.

462
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
I'm scared.

463
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
What are you talking about?

464
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Really.

465
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Do you want me to bring this French doll?

466
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Bring it home.

467
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
What?

468
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Why?

469
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Why?

470
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Don't say it.

471
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm telling you I'm scared.

472
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
I've been telling you I'm scared all this time.

473
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
You don't believe me, do you?

474
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Bring this French doll home.

475
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Go to bed.

476
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
What?

477
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
You're scared, aren't you?

478
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm scared?

479
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
You're scared, aren't you?

480
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
That's not true.

481
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Try it.

482
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,040
What?

483
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,040
But there's one thing I can say for sure.

484
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:25,040
This is a French doll.

485
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
What's so funny?

486
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:38,040
I often see Mr. Muzugoro's face on TV.

487
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I see him licking Mr. Muzugoro's face without hesitation.

488
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Why is that?

489
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm scared.

490
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
I see.

491
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
But that's what everyone thinks.

492
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
If there's a chance like that,

493
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
animals will talk to dogs.

494
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:08,040
If you give a microphone to an animal from the Muzugoro Kingdom, they'll talk to you.

495
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,040
If you say, come here, they'll say, come here.

496
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
They'll call you again.

497
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Please forgive me.

498
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Don't laugh.

499
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Don't laugh.

500
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Please forgive me.

501
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Please forgive me.
