1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
After this, let's hit the punch-bomb at the Gake no Tsukai in downtown!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I can hear it!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What is it?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's going on?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What time is it now?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a little past 5 o'clock.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's already 6 o'clock, isn't it?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's going on?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Isn't it already 6 o'clock?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're always angry.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good morning.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Good morning.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Excuse me, I just got a call from Matsumoto.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It looks like an accident.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What?

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What kind of accident?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well...

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He said he got hit by a fly.

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, really?

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I see.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Good morning.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good morning.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Matsumoto, did you get hit by a fly?

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What? Did you hear that voice?

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I heard it a little while ago.

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well...

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll go to the salon for a while.

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My shoulder hurts.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's okay.

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's not a joke.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's pretty late, isn't it?

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a call from Hikako.

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello, this is Hikako.

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hello.

46
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It hurts.

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Is it Matsumoto?

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It hurts.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

51
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What?

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

53
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not a call from Matsumoto.

54
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What?

55
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, well...

56
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I see.

57
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you know where he is?

58
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know.

59
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You don't know where he is, do you?

60
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know where he is.

61
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's ask him.

62
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's ask him.

63
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's ask him.

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's ask him.

65
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's ask him.

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's ask him.

67
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll do it.

68
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll do it.

69
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't do it.

70
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can't do it.

71
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There's no point in doing it even if you get injured.

72
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you saying?

73
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a TV program.

74
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

75
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's an actor and an actor.

76
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Put it on.

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is it close?

78
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's almost there.

79
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You said it's almost there.

80
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
OK, I'll put it on and go.

81
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go.

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Huh?

83
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What?

84
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What is it?

85
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Where is it?

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, hey, hey.

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What are you doing?

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Get out of here.

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We're friends.

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We're friends.

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Stop it.

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get out of here.

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Get out of here.

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Get out of here.

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's wrong with him?

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It hurts, it hurts.

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are you OK?

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm shaking.

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm shaking.

100
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sweating.

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did you do it on purpose?

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Huh?

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, that's what the police say.

105
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's 64 and the other side is bad, so you're OK.

107
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't think it's your fault.

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think it was pouring.

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I gave you a strange chance.

111
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're sweating.

112
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think it's because your body is burning.

113
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're sweating because it's hot.

114
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah.

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you OK today?

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Shiroku.

117
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's go to bed.

118
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We can't talk much.

119
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah.

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a variety show, but we won't get injured.

121
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do we do?

122
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Matsumoto.

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Matsumoto.

124
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Matsumoto.

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,540
Matsumoto.

126
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,000
Matsumoto.

127
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Matsumoto.

128
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Matsumoto.

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I.

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll do it.

131
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Matsumoto.

132
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Matsumoto.

133
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Matsumoto.

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I gave up.

135
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Matsumoto.

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Matsumoto.

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Matsumoto.

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Matsumoto.

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Matsumoto.

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Master, master, master, master, master, master, master, master, master...

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm really sorry to hear that.

142
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Excuse me, I just got a call from Matsumoto.

143
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It seems they have an accident.

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What kind of accident?

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I heard that you are from Okamagura.

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you talking about?

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I heard that you are from Okamagura.

148
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okamagura?

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

150
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What kind of Okamagura?

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I heard that you are from Okamagura.

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I heard that you are from Okamagura.

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are beautiful.

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's the first time I use a needle.

155
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's beautiful.

156
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The punishment is not bad.

157
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's do our best.

158
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is still a punishment game.

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, there is.

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's do that.

161
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
My nose is drooping.

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Everyone says that my nose is drooping in the opening.

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But I can't get that blue lantern.

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's hard.

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know the school.

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can see it when I look up.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's really cool.

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's blue.

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't get it.

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No matter how many times I do it.

171
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This job is hard.

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There are people who are always angry.

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Even if they are fighting.

175
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you say?

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They say,

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you doing?

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a joke.

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There are times when it becomes a joke.

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you understand?

181
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I understand.

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If it's a fight on the street.

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They say,

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is there such a stupid story?

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's a fight that's established.

186
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They say,

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you doing?

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is too much.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's not a fight.

190
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not a fight.

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But they say,

192
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's you.

193
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, no.

194
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Sometimes it's closer to a joke than anything.

195
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is a job disease.

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

197
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Usually.

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Usually.

199
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm saying a little bit.

200
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're taking a bath.

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The man next to you.

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was in the middle of a fight.

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know anything.

205
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You can say,

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey.

207
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

208
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's the same as that.

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's the same as that.

210
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's the same as that.

211
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm always thinking about something like that.

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm going with this kind of biology.

213
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't help it.

214
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I see.

215
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you going to do today?

216
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, after this,

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There's a punishment game left.

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There's something I have to do.

219
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a punishment game.

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a punishment game.

221
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, I'm not losing in rugby.

222
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No, no, no, no, no.

223
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, for the time being.

224
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I played with all of them.

225
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm not playing in a team.

226
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm already losing.

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, I'm not losing at all.

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No, I'm not losing.

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If I played seriously,

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's no sport that can beat me.

231
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know that.

232
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm still saying.

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Did you touch the ball even once in the last game?

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's wrong?

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Something's going on in the back.

236
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know.

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That rugby is made up of fake rules.

238
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What do you mean?

239
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you know?

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What do you mean?

241
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you know? Do you know?

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's stop it.

243
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, shall we say it?

244
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What kind of nonsense is that?

245
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, the real rugby is

246
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's about 40 minutes and 40 minutes.

247
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That rugby is that everyone has no physical strength.

248
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

249
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Think about you.

250
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why?

251
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I did it in 10 minutes and 10 minutes.

252
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's my body.

253
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why?

254
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, for me, 10 minutes is really a little bit.

255
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What do you say?

256
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There's something close to an audible.

257
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
From there on, it's called a stretch.

258
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
10 minutes is still a disaster.

259
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a disaster.

260
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's a jellyfish.

261
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you understand?

262
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I understand.

263
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I understand.

264
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I understand.

265
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I understand.

266
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm going to go from there.

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know.

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Even in Yamato, it takes time to make a wave.

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you going to do with Yamato?

270
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No, no, really, really.

271
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's why I didn't touch the ball.

272
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was looking at it.

273
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm in a hurry, but I'm scared.

274
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's why I'm going like this.

275
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I see.

276
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It hurts.

277
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you going to do with the past?

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It hurts.

279
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I said, okay, I got it.

280
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When it comes to this,

281
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's already.

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, it's not.

283
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's over in the first half.

284
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's over in the first half.

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's over in the first half.

286
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's over in the first half.

287
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's a second half.

288
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There's a second half left.

289
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
My body is like this.

290
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's like this.

291
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Everyone's starting to move again.

292
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's go like this.

293
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go like this.

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you watching again?

295
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why are you running?

296
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why are you running?

297
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you still watching?

298
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No matter what I did, the time was short.

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If I had 10 minutes left, I would have done it.

300
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What are you doing?

301
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're doing a great job.

302
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't say such a thing.

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's true.

304
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's enough.

305
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You say you didn't do anything.

306
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You say that, but you didn't do anything.

307
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't do anything either.

308
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I touched the ball twice.

309
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I grabbed it and ran.

310
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Even though I was defeated.

311
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I also scored two goal kicks.

312
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You were like this.

313
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When I looked up, the members were like this.

314
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Everyone was moaning.

315
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I always say this.

316
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

317
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If I don't save and play sports,

318
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If I move like you do,

319
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's really amazing.

320
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's a spring-bucket bowl.

321
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know.

322
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, really.

323
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I kick that ball as much as I want,

324
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's going to be a big deal.

325
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What do you mean?

326
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What do you mean by a big deal?

327
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What do you mean?

328
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you mean by a big deal?

329
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't even know that.

330
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Is there such an excuse?

332
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know.

333
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's not an excuse.

334
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I got it.

335
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to quit the group.

336
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you talking about?

337
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I should go to individual matches.

338
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If I get kicked by so many people,

339
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You!

340
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You!

341
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are you talking about?

342
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the same with baseball.

343
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I lost because you kicked me.

344
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

345
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really?

346
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Really?

347
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Did you save your strength?

348
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I did. Of course I did.

349
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Of course you did?

350
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Of course I did.

351
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm glad you gave me a big one.

352
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My strength is...

353
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
My arm...

354
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

355
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My strength is...

356
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My power is...

357
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My arm is...

358
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The power of a gold mine.

359
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

360
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you understand?

361
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So what?

362
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You shake your arm like this.

363
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're shaking it off, right?

364
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The power you gave me at that time

365
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's not a big shock to your arm.

366
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The base that supports your arm

367
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Your strength is

368
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's as good as you.

369
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's going well.

370
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's going well.

371
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's going well.

372
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's going well.

373
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But if I put out all my strength,

374
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm really going to lose my arm.

375
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You don't like it, do you?

376
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't lose my arm.

377
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't like it.

378
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can't lose your arm.

379
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't like it.

380
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
When we're having fun together,

381
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't lose my arm.

382
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're not happy.

383
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're not happy.

384
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It doesn't matter.

385
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It doesn't matter.

386
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't like it.

387
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's why I'm doing it because I don't want to bother you.

388
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can't lose your arm.

389
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You can't lose your arm.

390
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You can't lose your arm.

391
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can't lose your arm.

392
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's why I only throw you Herrnachocodama.

393
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
suffered

394
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's why I only throw you Herrnachocodama.

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hey, don't call it Herrnachocodama.

396
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're a Herrnachocodama.

397
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If this is what I'm like,

398
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll throw you, right?

399
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's do arm sweep.

400
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The arm goes like this.

401
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can you get me a blow?

402
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Then you'll live.

403
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When it comes to the outro.

404
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
100% I can't get a hold of.

405
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm not worried about it, but I'm scared of the catcher.

406
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll pay for it.

407
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You can't do that. I'm doing it because it's heavy.

408
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

409
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's you. Don't say it's heavy.

410
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I've never said anything that I don't understand.

411
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can say it now.

412
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't lift my arm.

413
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Even if I lift it with all my might.

414
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you want to buy it?

415
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What are you doing?

416
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why am I a punishment game?

417
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're unlucky.

418
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why?

419
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you want to do judo?

420
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's true.

421
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm good at judo.

422
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay.

423
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's do it.

424
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm really good at judo.

425
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Is that so?

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is that so?

427
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

428
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But I hate judo.

429
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You can't do that.

430
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There's one more thing.

431
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I have a big chest.

432
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Your hands and feet are slippery.

433
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why do you have a big chest?

434
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's disgusting.

435
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know.

436
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't want to show it.

437
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't want to show it.

438
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't want to show my chest.

439
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

440
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go home.

441
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's go home.

442
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's difficult to have a big audience.

443
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
At that time.

444
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
At that time.

445
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So, how can I say?

446
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There are times when the audience is heavy.

447
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There are.

448
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
There are times when the audience is heavy.

449
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

450
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So, when everyone is gathered together,

451
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There are times when unlucky people are gathering together.

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

453
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So, the audience is heavy.

454
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The atmosphere is heavy.

456
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

457
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There are times when the audience is heavy.

458
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Especially, there are many female guests.

459
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There are also female guests.

460
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

461
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There are also female guests.

462
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And if it's a heavy day,

463
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Your face will turn blue.

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If you are seen like this,

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want you to say,

466
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I want you to say,

467
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I want you to say,

468
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I want you to say,

469
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I want you to say,

470
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I want you to say,

471
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh my goodness!

472
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's heavy.

473
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's great.

474
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh my goodness.

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's different.

476
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And female bodies.

477
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's annoying.

478
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes, it is.

479
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Incredible things are going on.

480
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What are thinking?

481
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If we get out like this,

482
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It must hurt so bad.

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It hurts!

484
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It hurts!

485
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm surprised!

486
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It doesn't hurt!

487
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It doesn't hurt!

488
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's fine!

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's fine!

490
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It doesn't hurt, but it's bleeding!

491
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Even though it's bleeding, it's fine!

492
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's great!

493
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When I was a kid, when my dad was thrown into the sea and drowned,

494
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I was told that there was a danger signal.

495
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
When I was in elementary school, I rushed into a concrete pillar with great speed from the face.

496
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When I thought I was going to die, I saw a skull mark in front of me.

497
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I've been saying this for a long time.

498
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What is it?

499
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There should be some kind of sign before a person dies.

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, is that so?

501
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Get on more!

502
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're shy, aren't you?

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Get on more!

504
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, is that so?

505
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't say that.

506
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
There should be some kind of sign before a person dies.

508
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

509
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why aren't you surprised?

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There should be a sign.

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, is that so?

512
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I can't tell you that there was a sign.

513
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can't tell you because I'm dead.

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I understand.

516
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There should be some kind of sign before a person dies.

517
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What is that?

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Is there a personal difference?

519
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No, that's why I said there should be a blue flower before I die.

520
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's because you almost drowned in the pool.

521
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's a lot of oysters around you.

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He's about to die.

523
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You say there should be a blue flower.

524
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What kind of blue flower do you think it is?

525
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What do you mean?

526
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's it.

527
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Specifically, it's emerald green.

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What are you talking about?

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What kind of color is emerald green?

530
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What kind of color is emerald green?

531
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What kind of color is it?

532
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It looks normal.

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's close to that.

534
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This one?

535
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There's a flower like this.

536
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
There's a flower like this.

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's before you die.

538
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's a flower like this before you die.

539
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's dangerous to have a flower like that.

540
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is that so?

541
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sure there's something like that.

542
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sure there's something like that.

543
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The moment you hit a car,

544
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you say something to your right.

545
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's it.

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Who is whispering to his right?

547
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Is it a god?

548
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Is it a god?

549
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I absolutely believe in that.

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
From the building,

551
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
you jump down.

552
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You fall to the ground.

553
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's about one meter above the ground.

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You jump down.

555
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When you're about to hit the ground,

556
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you say,

557
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Thank you very much.

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Thank you very much.

559
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm sure there's something like that.

560
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But it's funny if you hear that before you die.

561
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Why don't you give it a try?

562
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
On the car.

563
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Is it your first time meeting?

564
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you get on the car

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and drive right to the wall,

566
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you'll probably hear it.

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's how dirty your eyes are.

568
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You know, there's that thing that's been done recently.

569
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Air bomb.

570
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,500
I think it's difficult to be a shinigami for that reason.

571
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,200
You're in trouble.

572
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Yes, yes, yes.

573
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,700
Shinigamis are always watching.

574
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,400
They think, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.

575
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
I don't know why the shinigami these days hit cars.

576
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,300
In the old days, you could just say, see you.

577
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,300
You could just look at the steering wheel and see if it's airbag style or not.

578
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,100
They say bad things.

579
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,700
I see.

580
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,300
You have to check that first.

581
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,900
I have to check it first.

582
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,600
Shinigamis are in trouble these days.

583
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
You're in trouble.

584
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,700
You can't say that.

585
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm sorry.

586
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,000
I have something I really want to tell you, Dauntan-sama.

587
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,600
The man in the Lark commercial for cigarettes,

588
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,300
why is he always aiming for someone's life?

589
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,500
I don't know.

590
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,400
He used to run away in a car on a narrow street.

591
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,100
He used to run away on a boat or something.

592
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:11,500
He used to carry a bottle of champagne and drop it.

593
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,100
He was always aiming for someone's life.

594
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,300
I wonder if everyone knows about this.

595
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,000
Hey, Lark.

596
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,900
Do you know about this?

597
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,800
Yes, I do.

598
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,200
This man used to smoke a lot.

599
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
What did he smoke?

600
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,200
What?

601
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,700
What did he smoke?

602
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:46,800
Well, I told him to quit smoking.

603
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
What did you tell him?

604
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,100
I told him to quit smoking.

605
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,600
He didn't listen to me.

606
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,500
You should have told him.

607
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,900
I should have told him.

608
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,600
You're a bad guy.

609
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,500
You're right.

610
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,100
You're a bad guy.

611
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,500
You're a bad guy.

612
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,200
You're a bad guy.

613
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,500
You're a bad guy.

614
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,300
Yes.

615
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,800
Come here.

616
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:23,500
You're a bad guy.
