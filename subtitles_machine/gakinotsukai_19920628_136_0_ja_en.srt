00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
I just briefly explain it...

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,400
When about to explain it briefly

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,060
If you go to Nishibori, Yasumoto Prof ë§žagis's.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,580
Who is the storage manager of the button

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,760
detachment

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,860
I'd like to talk to you

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,600
Cross from this Akasaka

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,340
azziand

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,180
Come on sales

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,100
This period of time we are chasing you in the hidden camera

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,100
I sent it to the person who set it up.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,100
I sent it and tried a lot of things.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,100
In the meantime, there were a lot of things going on.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Today, I would like you to go to Azabu Juba Onsen here for business.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:08,100
You can go directly to the money gala.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:17,100
The road is also crowded today, so I want you to walk all the way here.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Wear this jacket and go to the money gala.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,100
It's just right, isn't it?

19
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
Is this good?

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
No, I want you to return it.

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,100
If you go over there, there is a manager named Sakurai.

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
I won't go.

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,100
If you go this year, there will be other jobs.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,100
I'm happy.

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Please.

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100

Walk properly.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
I don't have a taxi.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,100
It's okay because you don't have a taxi.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:09,100
I don't have a taxi.

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,100
I don't think he can get on a taxi.

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Go to the hospital.

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Where is TBS?

34
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
I don't know.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Go straight and turn left.

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Turn left and go straight.

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
You should go.

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
I don't go.

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,100
I have a job.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,100
I don't have a job.

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,100
I'll give you half of this.

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,100
That's a good guy.

45
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,100
If you go that way, you'll see me.

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Thank you very much.

47
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Be careful.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:25,100
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I'm scared.

50
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,100
I'm scared.

51
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
I'm confused.

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,100
I'm confused.

53
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:45,100
I'm confused.

54
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm confused.

55
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
I'm confused.

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
I'm confused.

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Turn right and leave.

58
00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:01,100
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,100
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Oh?

61
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Oh, hello.

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
You're finally back.

63
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
I'm back.

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
Hello.

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Hey.

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Yes?

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
What?

68
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Are you a comedian?

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Are you a comedian?

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100
I don't know.

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Hey, hey.

See?

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
See?

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
This is famous.

78
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Our young man is a fan.

79
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Yes.

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Right?

81
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
I want to show you.

82
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Hey, come play with us.

83
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Yes.

84
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
No.

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
What should I do?

86
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Come and play with us while I'm talking.

87
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Yes.

88
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Yes.

89
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Hey, come play with us while I'm talking.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
No.

91
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
It's too hot.

92
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
I can't stand it.

93
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Run away.

94
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Hey, maybe you can teach me the theme song.

95
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
I don't know.

96
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Oh, he ran away.

97
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
He ran away.

98
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
He ran away.

99
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I don't know if it's because of the yakuza, but I'm being chased.

100
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
It's because you're running away.

101
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I'm scared.

102
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm scared.

103
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
I'm scared.

104
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
I'm scared.

105
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I'm scared.

106
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm scared.

107
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm scared.

108
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm scared.

109
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm scared.

110
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm scared.

111
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Just say you're going.

112
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
I don't know.

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,100
So many things happened and now I'm finally here.

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
I thought he ran away because he was followed by a lot of people.

115
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm Jimmy Onishi. Nice to meet you.

116
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Um, Kuro-san.

117
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Sakurai-san.

118
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Ah, Sakurai-san. I'm sorry.

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm the first Jimmy Onishi. Nice to meet you.

120
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Everyone, yes. Is it okay?

121
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Ah, everyone. Hello. I'm Jimmy Onishi.

122
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Um, everyone knows me, right?

123
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
I did it! I did it!

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Recently, it's getting hotter and hotter.

125
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Really. If it was this hot in July and June, I wonder how hot it would be in December.

126
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,100
He's facing this way. He's facing this way.

127
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Um, I'm the first Jimmy Onishi.

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm the first Jimmy Onishi.

129
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
I'm the first Jimmy Onishi.

130
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Excuse me, ma'am. Can you touch this for a moment?

131
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Ah, it's a bit wet.

132
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Why is it wet?

133
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Really.

134
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Why is it wet?

135
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I don't know.

136
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
It's really wet.

137
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Excuse me, ma'am.

138
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
I don't know if it's wet or not.

139
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Ah, really. I don't know if it's wet or not.

140
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Today, um, today, everyone's tour is over.

141
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Um, we hope to see you again.

142
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm not going home.

143
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Thank you very much.

144
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Ah, thank you very much.

145
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Thank you very much.

146
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
It's really hot today.

147
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Let's do it.

148
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Yes.

149
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
I'll give you the gyara here.

150
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Yes.

151
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,100
It's a little heavy because there's a lot of food.

152
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Yes.

153
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Thank you.

154
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
My gyara is taiyaki.

155
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
He's frowning.

156
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
He's frowning.

157
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Thank you very much.

158
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Is it good?

159
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Yes.

160
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Thank you very much.

161
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Thank you very much.

162
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
I thought I'd get it if I was told to.

163
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Um, Mr. Sakurai, please.

164
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Yes.

165
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
Mr. Sakurai, please.

166
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Ah, thank you very much for today.

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Thank you.

168
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
Yes.

169
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
This way, please.

170
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Ah, I'm really going home.

171
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
It's okay.

172
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Yes.

173
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Is that okay?

174
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Yes.

175
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
I'm really going home.

176
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Yes.

177
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
This way, please.

178
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Yes.

179
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Thank you very much.

180
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Um, excuse me.

181
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Um, I'm the manager.

182
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Yes.

183
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,100
The gyara was given to me by Mr. Sakurai.

184
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Yes.

185
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,100
I heard that taiyaki is a gyara.

186
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Is that true?

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Isn't that a joke?

188
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
He noticed it.

189
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
He noticed it.

190
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
He noticed it.

191
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
I got taiyaki.

192
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
He got taiyaki.

193
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
I'm going to take it with me.

194
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Where's the money?

195
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
He's still saying it.

196
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
It's Mr. Sakurai, right?

197
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Yes.

198
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Thank you for your hard work.

199
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Yes.

200
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Yeah.

201
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
How was it?

202
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
It was really good.

203
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
It was really good.

204
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
It was really good.

205
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
It was really good.

206
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
It was really good.

207
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
It was really good.

208
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Hey, didn't you get a shock?

209
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
You got a shock.

210
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Did you get a shock?

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
You got a shock.

212
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
I didn't get a shock.

213
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
That's not true.

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
You got a shock.

215
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I didn't get a shock.

216
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
I didn't get a shock.

217
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
You did.

218
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Be honest with me.

219
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
You got a shock.

220
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Excuse me.

221
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Look.

222
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
The microphone is on.

223
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
I'm the real one.

224
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Why are you laughing?

225
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm the real one.

226
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,100
I get excited when I see a star.

227
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Don't say that.

228
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Don't say that.

229
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
That's right.

230
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I say Hama-chan.

231
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I just get excited and say it.

232
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
I can't stop myself.

233
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I can't stop myself.

234
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I just can't stop myself.

235
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Actually I don't remember saying Hama-chan.

236
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
You don't remember.

237
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
It was really...

238
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
You said it in my mouth.

239
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
You said it while looking at me.

240
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
I got excited and it came out.

241
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
I got excited and said Hama-chan.

242
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
That's what I'm saying.

243
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
That's scary!

244
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
That's right! I don't need that kind of thing!

245
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
It's scary, you know.

246
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
You come out like this, and you don't check anything.

247
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
It's not like you're doing a body check or anything.

248
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,100
You come in like this, and you're excited.

249
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
When you go to a fan meeting,

250
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,100
you want to be the only one there.

251
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
So what kind of behavior are you doing?

252
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
From around here, you go like this.

253
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
That's dangerous!

254
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,100
That's what I'm saying.

255
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Why don't you blow your nose?

256
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
That's because I like it too much.

257
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,100
That's a very high probability.

258
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,100
You blow your nose from around there, and you stick your nose in here.

259
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
There might be people like that.

260
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,100
If you think about it, it's a scary world.

261
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I don't think there's anything like that.

262
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
It's scary.

263
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Well, it's fine.

264
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
There's no one who comes to a place like this.

265
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
No, no, no.

266
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
I don't know about my fans.

267
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
There are fans, too.

268
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
It's about the other day's incident, but I still can't give up.

269
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
What kind of incident is this?

270
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
It's a grudge.

271
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
It's really a grudge.

272
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I said I baked a pancake.

273
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
You sent me a pancake as a tip.

274
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
You started with cold noodles.

275
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,100
When I gave you the butter, it stank.

276
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
It's a bad habit.

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
It's a nuisance.

278
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,100
What did I do?

279
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,100
I thought you'd want it, so I thought about it and sent it to you.

280
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
It's practical.

281
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
It's practical.

282
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I've been saying it on TV all the time.

283
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Yes, the sleeping bag of Robocop.

284
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Transforming sleeping bag.

285
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Don't say that.

286
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
I can't send it to you.

287
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I had no choice but to get it.

288
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm wearing it at home.

289
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
It's hot.

290
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
It's really hot.

291
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
It's really hot.

292
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm sweating.

293
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,100
But the mission I was given is...

294
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
What mission?

295
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
It's up to here.

296
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
It's up to here.

297
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Right?

298
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
That's fine.

299
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
It's like that.

300
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,100
The other day, the day before,

301
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Yes.

302
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
It's rice.

303
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
It's on the street.

304
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
It's near my house.

305
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I was told to bring it home.

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I didn't bring it home that day.

307
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
It's you.

308
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,100
You threw it in the middle of the street.

309
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
In the middle of the street.

310
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I was looking at my fans.

311
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Wait!

312
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Because...

313
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Because I hate chocolate.

314
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
I hate it.

315
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Don't say that.

316
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Everyone is throwing it away.

317
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Katsuno Hiroshi, too.

318
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Why Katsuno Hiroshi?

319
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Why Katsuno Hiroshi?

320
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Because something just came out.

321
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
The cash is going to get dirty.

322
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
That's it.

323
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Yes.

324
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
It's hard.

325
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
It's hard.

326
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
The talent too.

327
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
The talent too.

328
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
If you're called Hamada,

329
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Harutatsu will call you Romi-chan.

330
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
It depends on the person who said it.

331
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Oh, really?

332
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Yes.

333
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
What kind of person?

334
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Someone who walks around like that.

335
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Someone who looks like he's going to cry.

336
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
I don't know.

337
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, Hamada.

338
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
What?

339
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
But...

340
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
But you're Hamada.

341
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
I know.

342
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
That's right.

343
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
You're really Hamada.

344
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
That's why you're Hamada.

345
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
For example,

346
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,100
If you were called Deba-bouchou,

347
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
What are you talking about?

348
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Shunputei Deba-bouchou.

349
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
It's definitely not going to sell.

350
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Deba-bouchou.

351
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Deba-bouchou.

352
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
But you're not angry, are you?

353
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
No.

354
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
I don't understand that.

355
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
No, no.

356
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
You're not angry.

357
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
It would have been nice if you had a stage name.

358
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
By the way,

359
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
If you're called a painful person,

360
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
A painful person,

361
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
A yakuza.

362
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,100
It's okay if you're called a yakuza.

363
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
That's not good.

364
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
The other day,

365
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
When I came to Tokyo from Oda,

366
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
I got off at the station,

367
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
And the back seat was full.

368
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
At first,

369
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
At first, they said,

370
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Hey, Hamada.

371
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
I said,

372
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Yakuza, that's enough.

373
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
They said,

374
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Hey, Hamada.

375
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I said,

376
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Yes.

377
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
I said,

378
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Yes.

379
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I said,

380
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I said,

381
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
I said,

382
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I said,

383
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I said,

384
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
I said,

385
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I said,

386
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
I said,

387
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
I said,

388
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I said,

389
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I said,

390
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
I said,

391
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
I said,

392
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,100
I said,

393
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
I said,

394
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:06,100
If you say something you like because women will be interested,

395
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
You're covering your face.

396
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Trust.

397
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
What?

398
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
What?

399
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
What?

400
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Trust you.

401
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
What?

402
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Trust.

403
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
If you say something you like,

404
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
I'll get my weekly review.

405
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
I'd like to ask you something.

406
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,100
In Yoshimoto Kogyo, there is a person called Hamane-san.

407
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,100
You don't know him, do you? Hamane Takashi.

408
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
I don't even know his full name.

409
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
You don't even know how soft he is.

410
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Hamane-san's house is near my grandmother's house.

411
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
But Hamane-san doesn't come out on TV.

412
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,100
So I'm very worried about my grandmother who lives in the same area.

413
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Where is Hamane-san and what is he doing?

414
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
I don't know.

415
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Please use Hamane-san on TV with the power of Downtown.

416
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
But Hamane-kun is doing his best in Osaka now.

417
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
By myodo manzai.

418
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Oh, is that so?

419
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Yes, yes, yes.

420
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
I like the feeling of the gag.

421
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,100
The new gag is Hamane-kun's gag.

422
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
I'm surprised, I'm surprised, I'm surprised, I'm surprised.

423
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,100
When I saw this, I didn't think much, so I didn't feel bad.

424
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Do you want me to call you?

425
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
What are you doing?

426
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
I'm surprised, I'm surprised, I'm surprised.

427
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
There are a lot of people in Osaka.

428
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,100
There are a lot of people who want to introduce them to you.

429
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Look, look.

430
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
There was a person named Choichi-san, right?

431
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Choichi-san.

432
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
He was doing magic with fire.

433
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,100
He was doing it like this, and the fire flew like this.

434
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
That person is Zura.

435
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,100
He was burning like this.

436
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
I don't even know this.

437
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
If it was a fire head, I wouldn't know.

438
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
If my head was burning.

439
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,100
But it's a wig, so it's not that hot, right?

440
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
The woman from the back was like,

441
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Sensei, head, head.

442
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Sensei, head.

443
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Why?

444
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Do your legs stink?

445
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Are you stepping on something while a strange insect is sleeping?

446
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Please tell me about that.

447
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Most men have stinky feet, right?

448
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Well, I guess so.

449
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
But I really have stinky feet.

450
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
But your feet are stinky.

451
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,100
It's more than I expected.

452
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Wait.

453
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Since you were born, I want to smell as much as you once.

454
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Why?

455
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Everyone is human.

456
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
I want to be bad.

457
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I can't be bad.

458
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Is it bad to be stinky?

459
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Are you stupid?

460
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
I want to be bad.

461
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Are you stupid?

462
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Take off your shoes.

463
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Wait, let me tell you.

464
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,100
I don't wear these shoes all the time.

465
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
These are the shoes that my stylist brought.

466
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm wearing them now.

467
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
That means, after this program,

468
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Don't say that.

469
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Do you want to say that my feet stink in a short time?

470
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Don't say that.

471
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
These are the shoes that I used to wear all the time.

472
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Don't say that.

473
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Why?

474
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Take off your shoes.

475
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
No.

476
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Don't say that.

477
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I can't see.

478
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
No.

479
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I can't smell.

480
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Explain.

481
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You don't have to do that.

482
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Explain.

483
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Explain.

484
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
I can't smell.

485
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Take off your shoes.

486
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I won't run away.

487
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
What do you think?

488
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Are you a reporter?

489
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
This is it.

490
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
That's right.

491
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
This is it.

492
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,100
It looks good, doesn't it?

493
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
That's right.

494
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I see.

495
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,100
It took about an hour to make this.

496
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
An hour ago?

497
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Yes.

498
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I boiled it.

499
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
I see.

500
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
That's right.

501
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Well then.

502
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Thank you for the food.

503
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
You're welcome.

504
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
It stinks.

505
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
But it doesn't stink.

506
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,100
It only smells like leather.

507
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I don't know.

508
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
I've been looking at you like this all the time.

509
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
It doesn't stink at all.

510
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
It only smells like leather.

511
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,100
So why does a guy like you smell like that?

512
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
That's why it doesn't stink.

513
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
No, no, no.

514
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,100
It stinks as much as your feet stink.

515
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Who is it?

516
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
I've never smelled it.

517
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,100
It stinks as much as your teeth stink.

518
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Who is it?

519
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Number two?

520
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
No, it's number two.

521
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
It doesn't stink at all.

522
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Look, look.

523
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
That's enough.

524
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
That's enough.

525
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
My socks.

526
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
My socks.

527
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
It's okay.

528
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Try it on.

529
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Try it on.

530
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm so confident.

531
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
I'll tell you this.

532
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,100
I've been wearing this since this morning.

533
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
I didn't change my clothes here.

534
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
Try it on.

535
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
It doesn't stink at all.

536
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
This is it.

537
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
This?

538
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Yes, that's right.

539
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Then...

540
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
It's soft.

541
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
It's soft.

542
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
I've been wearing it for a long time.

543
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
That's right.

544
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,100
It feels tight.

545
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
That's not true.

546
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
You'll get angry.

547
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Then...

548
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I'll try it on.

549
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:29,100
Here you go.
