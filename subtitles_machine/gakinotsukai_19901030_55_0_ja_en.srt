00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikichiki Magic Taneakashi Daigassen!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good evening. Today we are going to talk about Magic Taneakashi Daigassen.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's introduce our guests.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
First of all, Magi Shiro.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Next to him is Matsumoto Shito.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Today we are going to do some magic.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We are going to show you how to do it.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I am good at it.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How many types can you do?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I can do about 7 types.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Shut up!

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are not a bad guy.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why you can eat, right?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I will never go to the same place again.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Today we are going to do some magic.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's call the teacher.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
She is Sumie Sensei.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Nice to meet you too.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First question.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There are 6 cards with a dice mark here.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We have a dice here.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please roll the dice.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The person with the black jumper.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
3.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
3.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please roll the 3 cards.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Please clean up the rest of the cards.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is not to show the front.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is to show the back.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The back is red.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is also red.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is also red.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is also red.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All of them are red.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Only this one is blue.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is the magic.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is easy.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Really?

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Really?

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is magic.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Can I do it again?

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can't do it again.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are the president.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please go back to your seat.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The answer is...

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What is the correct answer?

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There is a dice mark here.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So...

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
On the dice?

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There is no 3.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No matter how many you roll?

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There is no hand.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know that.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I know that.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think this is right.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He quickly gave us the blue contact.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He gave us the blue contact?

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He gave us the blue contact?

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Even if you look at it, it is blue.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is that.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is that okay?

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Even if I roll this,

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think the 3 will come out.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you roll 10 times, it will be 10 times.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The 5 came out.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What does that mean?

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As expected, it is Trump.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hey!

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You just raised your voice.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are such an old man.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What is the correct answer?

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It is a secret.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You don't look at it much because it is night.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am looking at it!

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The 3 cards have different colors.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So...

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For example, if the opponent takes the red card,

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I only showed the blue card.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't do it until I do it.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because I am the president.

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Is it okay to show it so far?

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's okay.

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because you are the president.

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because I am the president.

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I see.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because I am the president.

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's funny.

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's funny.

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Final Tuesday

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes, the second solution.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now, a lot of summoning has depends on you right now.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you bend your arms, it's a super magic.

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won't bend my arms today.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have a card for this kind of telepathy experiment.

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Matsumoto-kun, please take it.

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
When you take it, look at it and remember it.

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Put it on your chest.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a telepathy experiment.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I felt it.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not a curved line.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know if I have to bend my arms.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What is a curved line?

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Think about it strongly.

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't want to think about it.

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's drawn in a straight line.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
First of all, I can see the small bar next to it.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not one.

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The other one is vertical.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Can I look at it?

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh!

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on!

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't you know this?

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Think about it!

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What is the answer?

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don!

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Matsumoto-san and Guru.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I see.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't think this is wrong.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What is it?

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Telepathy!

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't want to do telepathy!

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The correct answer is...

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It doesn't matter what order it is.

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You need to think about it.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Remember all the order.

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You need to think about it.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you move five pieces,

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the bottom one is a star.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The top one is a triangle.

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You need to remember it.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's not telepathy.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I can't do this.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you need memory?

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What kind of brain did you use?

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I didn't know that.

144
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm good at the trick of Trump.

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I didn't know that.

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How do you know that?

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I didn't know that.

148
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You are the captain.

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There is a piece of Trump.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Pull it from here.

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Pull it from here.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Remember this.

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Show it to the camera.

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This one?

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can't see it.

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Did you remember?

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Put it in here.

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is the opposite.

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Like this.

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I mixed it by mistake.

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mix it and hit it.

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
From the 52 pieces.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The ace of hearts.

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How is it?

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't have any balls.

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't have any balls.

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't have any balls.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't have any balls.

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The show has started.

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you mean?

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It has started.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It has ended.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Did you watch it?

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not interesting.

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't watch it.

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have been doing research.

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When did you do research?

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have done research.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have done research.

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are lying.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I have done research.

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have done research.

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You shouldn't have done it.

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why?

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am curious.

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How many types of people's expressions are there?

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I have done research.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Crying, laughing, getting angry.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the basic.

190
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is the basic.

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There is something else.

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There is a face that can't say anything.

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Do it.

194
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
A face that can't say anything.

195
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's not it.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What kind of face can't say anything?

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What kind of face can't say anything?

199
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
A face that can't say anything.

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What is that?

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
A face that can't say anything.

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What is that?

203
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was in a car.

204
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A young man was driving.

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He was walking in front of me.

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He was angry.

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
His face was like this.

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
His face was like this.

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
His face?

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
His face.

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There is a face that can't say anything.

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There is a face that can't say anything.

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He must have been irritated.

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That day.

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There were a lot of bad things.

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He was angry.

217
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He couldn't stand it.

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What is that face that can't say anything?

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He was angry.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He was angry.

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He was surprised.

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
His face was amazing.

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why do you keep looking at me?

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He was like this.

225
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Say it again?

226
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do it in front of me.

227
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let me do it.

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let me do it.

229
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know if I can.

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The face.

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I will try.

232
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I have some sea there.

233
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let me do it.

234
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let me do it.

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know how to do it.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know how to do it.

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will try.

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I will try.

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's like you're wearing it

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Take it off

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay

242
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Your face should be facing the camera

243
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How many times do I have to do it?

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, this way

245
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's go

246
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're so slimy

247
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're so slimy

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's not it

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's not it

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's not it

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's not it

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You shouldn't think like that

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You should've...

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You should've...

255
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You should've cried

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're so slimy

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're so slimy

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You should've cried

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're so slimy

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How many times did I have to do it?

261
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How many times did I have to do it?

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I didn't cry at all

263
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I didn't cry at all

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I didn't cry at all

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I was thinking I understood

266
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So I canceled

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Sorry but I can't say it

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's okay even if you can't say it

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Recently was fun

270
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
When I rode a car in Osaka

271
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When I rode a car

272
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It lost control

273
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That was for female roles

274
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That person had driving

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The man by my side

276
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
didn't do anything bad

277
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The guy behind me was angry too. He was looking at me from behind.

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He was looking at me from the side.

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He was angry too, so he opened the window and there was a fight.

280
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It was a fist fight.

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't need that.

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The guy on the other side was angry.

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He was angry at me.

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Who are you talking to?

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He was angry. He was angry at me because of this car.

286
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He was angry, but he was laughing at me who was sitting next to him.

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I see.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If you were an amateur, you might have complained.

289
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right.

290
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
At the moment you opened the window.

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But when we met, it was you.

292
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right.

293
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I thought it was you.

294
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I thought it was you.

295
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
With an angry face.

296
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
With an angry face, I thought it was you.

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And then?

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I laughed.

299
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's try it.

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's still going on.

301
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I laughed.

302
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I laughed, but the guy who was sitting next to me said,

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What the hell is this?

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then he left with a very pitiful face.

305
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's try it.

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Try it.

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll sit next to you.

308
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's right.

309
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't say, what the hell is this?

310
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What the hell is this?

312
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's not it.

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's not it.

314
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You.

315
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What the hell is this?

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're bad.

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm going home.

318
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Look at that guy.

319
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What the hell is this when you laugh?

320
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Say it first.

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know what's going on.

322
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going home.

323
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What the hell is this?

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's try it.

325
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What the hell is this when you laugh?

326
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey, hey, you kicked me.

327
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wait.

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You kicked me at the free talk.

330
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

331
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

332
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait.

333
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What the hell is this when you laugh?

334
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Say it first.

335
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know what's going on.

336
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's right.

337
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know what's going on.

338
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What the hell is this?

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, hey, hey.

340
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What the hell is this?

341
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

342
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's try it.

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Where are you looking?

344
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I can't organize it.

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Say it.

346
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I feel like I can do it with that face.

347
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

348
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, hey, hey.

349
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's not it.

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's not it.

352
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can't do it again.

353
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's not it.

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's not it.

355
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's not it at all.

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's not it.

357
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why are you putting your tongue out?

358
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's not it.

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What the hell is that?

360
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do it like that.

361
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What the hell is that?

362
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is too much.

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't understand it anymore.

364
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It must be this way.

365
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How miserable.

366
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's right.

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's interesting what humans look like when they think this way.

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Japanese people are said without any emotions when they are abroad.

369
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But Japanese people really don't say it properly.

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
With facial expressions.

371
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Japanese people are really bad at cooking.

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There are only three things Japanese people are good at.

373
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's why this is no good.

374
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Japanese people are often told that they don't know what they are thinking.

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's good.

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if it's a sour face, you don't have to do it.

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Try a sour face.

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It stinks.

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do a sweet and sour face.

380
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Try it.

381
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
A sweet and sour face.

382
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Try a sweet and sour face.

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
A sweet and sour face.

384
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why are you looking at me?

385
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm doing a sweet and sour face, right?

386
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why?

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a sweet and sour face for youth.

388
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You should eat something.

389
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Why are you looking at me?

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why?

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

392
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Maybe you can do it.

393
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What are you talking about?

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

395
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Maybe you can do it.

396
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's not it.

397
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's move on.

398
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Why are you like that?

399
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're not like that when you start with a sour face.

400
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

401
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
From a sour face?

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What are you talking about?

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's a sour face.

404
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's a sour face.

405
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I brought it.

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Who is it?

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thank you.

409
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
How about you?

410
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's nothing.

411
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What is this?

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm going to give this to the person I introduced on the show.

413
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is the person who does this kind of work.

414
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Really?

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes.

416
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you very much.

417
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please do your best.

418
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm going to give this to the person I'm going to introduce on the show.

419
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm a housewife.

420
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I enjoy watching you every week.

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm watching you.

422
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm watching you.

423
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
When I look at the two of you, I feel like I'm watching Yumeji Itoshikoi.

424
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you think so in Tokyo?

425
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Do you know Itoshikoi?

426
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
When we first came out, we were told that we looked like Itoshikoi.

427
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's a teacher.

428
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I was waiting for you to become a bigger entertainer.

429
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm glad you're here.

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm going to show you the most authentic comedy.

431
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't forget that you're not just a young kid.

432
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Thank you very much.

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm going to give this mother a ring.

434
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Listen to what I said the other day.

435
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There was an old man in the train waiting for the express train to pass.

436
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He waved at me.

437
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So I said hello to him.

438
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And then I realized that he had a line.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why do men do this?

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Wait a minute.

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He was waving at me.

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What do you mean he was waving at you?

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He was waving at me from above.

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He was waving at me from below.

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I thought he was looking at me.

446
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's a sign.

447
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why do men do this?

448
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know.

449
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't know.

450
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He wasn't waving at me.

451
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He didn't wave at me from below.

452
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Have you ever done that?

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No.

454
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Have you ever done that?

455
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Good luck.

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Have you ever done that?

457
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No.

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I've heard about it from you.

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I've heard about it from you.

460
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm doing it off the frame.

461
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Why are you doing it from below?

462
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm doing it off the frame.

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why are you doing it from below?

464
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've heard about it from you.

465
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've done it.

466
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You haven't done it.

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've done it.

468
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You've done it in the car, right?

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You've done it in the car, right?

470
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You've done it in the car.

471
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You were waiting for your turn.

472
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A woman was driving in the corner of the street.

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You were waiting for your turn.

474
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You've done it in the car, right?

475
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A long time ago.

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hang on.

477
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You could have done it.

478
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've heard about it.

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've heard of it.

480
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You've done it in the car.

481
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I haven't done it.

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Are you a monkey?

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That was 9 years ago, right after I entered this world

484
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The woman I was dating at that time was in her early years

485
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In her early years, she was wearing a kimono with her hair like this

486
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What?

487
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, it was New Year's Day

488
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
She was going to give me a kimono and a hair

489
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I took her to the farm and waited for her

490
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I waited for her and I couldn't go home

491
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When I looked down, she was not there

492
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
She said she was tired

493
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
She said she was sleepy

494
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
She said she was tired

495
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I didn't do anything

496
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I just wanted to hold her

497
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When she was sleepy, there were not many men

498
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Right?

499
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
When she was sleepy, she was harder than iron

500
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's it

501
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm waiting for your letter

502
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's good

503
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's go home

504
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's enough

505
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Look at my finger

506
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Look at the letter

507
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's harder than iron

508
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because it's diamond

509
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's what I wanted to say

510
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's why I wanted to say it

511
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's all

512
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Thank you very much

513
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Please come again

514
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
From now on, let's listen to the music

515
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's easy to go home

516
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's hard to go home

517
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What kind of music do you want?

518
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't want to make a fuss

519
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't want to go home

520
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Right?

521
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's listen to it

522
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't think it will come out today

523
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You didn't prepare it?

524
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Will it come out?

525
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, it will

526
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's what I wanted to say

527
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you very much

528
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We want to go home

529
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you

530
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Please come again

531
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's listen to it again

532
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's cold these days

533
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's cold

534
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's cold at night

535
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You have to be careful not to catch a cold

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I caught a cold and went to sleep

537
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Why did you catch a cold and go to sleep?

538
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I caught a cold and went to sleep

539
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You don't have a blanket?

540
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I have a blanket

541
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I caught a cold and went to sleep

542
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's all

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Thank you very much

544
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's listen to it again

545
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What?

546
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You don't have a blanket?

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's listen to it again

548
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,260
The meeting place of the

549
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,000
The meeting place of the word

550
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you stupid?

551
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's make it clear

552
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What?

553
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a water bridge, right?

554
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's funny

555
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Harakawa Nihonari Station

556
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
At 12 o'clock on November 10th

557
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We will prepare it

558
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If we open it

559
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We will get 4.9 billion yen

560
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If we have that much money

561
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We will think about it

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You have a lot of money, right?

563
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What?

564
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't have money at all

565
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And an assistant

566
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I want to give you more

567
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I will give you a little

568
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If you give me now

569
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I might be able to go to Nijio Prefecture

570
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's all

571
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Thank you very much

572
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Thank you

573
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,000
