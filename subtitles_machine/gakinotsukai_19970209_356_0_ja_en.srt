1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's eat curry udon at Chikishiki Curry Udon at your own leisure, Grand Prix!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's curry udon, isn't it?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, it's curry udon.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's delicious at this time of the year, so we eat it, but it flies away.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It flies away in this beautiful, freshly bought shirt.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a terrible story.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I want you to polish your skills to eat it cleanly.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you can't eat it in four minutes, you'll get five points.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's written like this.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's one point.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you can't eat it in four minutes, you'll get five points.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the worst case, the person with the highest score will get a terrible punishment.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's starting now.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm surprised.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was surprised.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The first group.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ready.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This project has more strict conditions than you can imagine.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The chopsticks are slippery.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If there is a piece of noodles left, it is a draw.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's delicious.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's hot.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We don't have time.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hurry up and eat.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The first group.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There is little time left.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How is the soup?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's delicious.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't eat it.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The second group.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's over.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The noodles are left.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is a minus point.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's empty.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's in the stomach.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's in the stomach.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's one point.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's six points.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's ten points.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's eleven points.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's over.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Sakamoto struggled.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But surprisingly...

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's seven points.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You saw the first group, right?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's eat more like a man.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Like a man.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't eat too much.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There is a lot.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What is that?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why?

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't know.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The second group.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ready.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Start.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The second group.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kokoriko is the first to join this year.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are too close to Tanaka.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't talk while you are eating.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The last minute.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's the last minute.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The last minute.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Start.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's over.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's over.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What is that?

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I saw something white.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's pink.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I got it.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's this.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is dangerous.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Five points.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't eat this.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What about the bottom one?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Twenty-eight.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Downtown didn't miss a drop.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Twenty-nine.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Twenty-nine.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it dangerous?

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What about Kokoriko and Endo?

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There are four here.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's random.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thirty-one, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Fifty-five.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Endo, fifty-five.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HEPO.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I left most of them.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you going to do with this?

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What are you doing?

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's really angry.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And he's being scolded in a low voice.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's even scarier.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's okay if he gets angry.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Matsumoto gets 40 points more.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
17, 18, 19, 20.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
21.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 39.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
32.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There are two here.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
33, 34.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a child.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's on his sleeve.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
35.

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How many did you get?

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Saito got 75 points.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's no way you can get 75 points.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If that's the case, you need a little more time.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, it's your turn.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you reacting like that?

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's coming.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's coming.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why are you reacting like that?

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are you reacting like that?

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ready.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And the final round starts.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Two minutes is pretty fast.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Two minutes is fast.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You'll lose points if you don't do it.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's hot.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The last 30 seconds.

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hurry up.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Time's up.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Time's up.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Keep it up.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's on his sleeve.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's on his sleeve.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's on his sleeve.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's on his sleeve.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is not fair.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is 40 points.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not fair.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not fair.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not fair.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Look.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's 30 points.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You should have 20 points.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Seriously.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you win, you'll get a penalty.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is not fair.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If we continue like this, Yamazaki will get a penalty.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Heipo and Yamazaki will play off.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which one is the penalty game?

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Ready.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're a little too close.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're a little too close.

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
One point.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're getting close.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No matter how many times I say it.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No matter how many times I say it.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Two points.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're getting too close.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Bring the noodles.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Bring the noodles.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Bring the noodles like Heipo.

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Shut up.

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't want to get involved.

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Time's up.

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please look at this.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry to my father.

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There's a lot left.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
At this point.

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're just complaining.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There's no point in counting.

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It can't be helped.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The penalty game is Heipo of the world.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The penalty game is Heipo of the world.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a curry.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Heipo will go to India.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He will go to India to clean.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He will bring the clothes he prepared.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He will clean the place.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He will come back.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He will get on the plane.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He will get on the plane.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can't be mistaken for a newbie.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There's a car.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I've finally arrived in India.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's like a hot spring.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm scared.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm taking a picture.

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm taking a picture.

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm taking a picture.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm taking a picture.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm scared.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm cleaning.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm scared.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm cleaning.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm cleaning.

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm scared.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm going to the center.

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm going to the center.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm going to the center.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Bean soup?

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Japanese curry?

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Curry?

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go on.

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sorry.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Another one?

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sir?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes?

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Very handsome.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Very handsome.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Thank you.

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Arigatou gozaimasu.

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, it's so beautiful. It's not attached at all.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There were a lot of these attached.

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Alright, I can go back to Japan with this.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There were a lot of people here, right?

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I didn't make any noise.

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Today's guest is going to get beaten if he shows his moon.

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's why I think it's better to be natural.

231
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's not that.

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I really don't want to change forever.

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What are you talking about?

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm just saying.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's going to be a big era.

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What do you mean?

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The number of children is decreasing.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If we continue like this, the number of elderly people is going to increase.

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I see.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to be in trouble.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why?

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No one is going to take care of me.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's what you're thinking now, right?

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know what's going to happen next.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't want to get married.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's why I think we should have children in various places.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You look a bit old.

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Right?

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Stop asking me.

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I want to have a baby.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't want.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It doesn't suit you.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You mean, you're going to take over the family?

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No way.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
More specifically, it's like a baby in an exam.

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Even if you don't know who the mother is, you can take care of the child.

258
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
About 10.

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
10 people? What are you going to do with 10 people?

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What are you doing?

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm holding you

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
10 people?

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing?

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's raining

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's raining?

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've been protecting you

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
10 people

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can go somewhere else

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If it's raining

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It feels good

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It doesn't feel good

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's impossible

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why?

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's impossible

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What do you do every day?

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't go to work

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't do something like Agnes

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're on TV all the time

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Get out

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Take off your gloves

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Put it on

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The golf course

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The bottom is 90 and the top is 120

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Mr. Matsumoto

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Tiger Woods is very popular

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
in the golf world

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
From Mr. Matsumoto's point of view

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Tiger Woods is still very popular

289
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please give me some advice

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please give me some advice

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Do you know Tiger Woods?

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He's on the news a lot

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He won

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The other day

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Where?

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Spielberg

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
At Hebel Beach

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You know it well

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've been watching it

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I thought he was good

303
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But he's still

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
not very good mentally

305
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He's good at technology

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He's quite rough

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But he was

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
much better at Hebel Beach

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I wanted to say that

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I wanted to say that

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is that so?

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Can you give me some advice?

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You're on a golf course

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in the middle of the night

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What are you doing?

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you doing?

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you doing?

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What are you doing?

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm taking a lesson

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I have a teacher

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, no

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You shouldn't teach

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I shouldn't teach golf

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I should do it

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why are you angry?

327
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You should trust me

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Wait

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What are you doing?

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The balance is bad

331
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Why are you doing this?

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're not doing it for Mr. Oka

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You shouldn't fall down

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
First

335
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You should open more

336
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like this

337
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Open more

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like this

339
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Lower your left leg

340
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Left leg?

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Like this

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't bend

343
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Don't bend

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like this

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Good

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm tired

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Put your fingers up

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Put your fingers up

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Put your fingers up

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Like this?

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Put your fingers up

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Like this?

354
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Like this

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Put it on your forehead

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
How do you do it?

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
How do you do it?

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Like this?

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can do it

360
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No, it's the same

361
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What did you do it for?

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you can avoid it

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Don't do it

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't do it

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't think you're alone

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I look like I'm alone

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's why you're angry

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
How do you do it?

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't try to learn everything from others

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There are only hints today

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Right?

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't teach you everything

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't teach you everything

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I know

375
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Right?

376
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes

377
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Think about it

378
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Think about it in English

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Think about it in English

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's too complicated

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
S-E-R-O

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
G-A

384
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I have a question for you

386
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I have a question for you

387
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
When your teacher hates you

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When your teacher hates you

389
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How do you improve your image?

390
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I have a way

391
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I can get away from them

392
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Even if you don't like them

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can't just get away

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
There's no one I don't like

395
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There's no one I don't like

396
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
For example, you can try to raise your chest

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
For example, you can try to raise your chest

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's a woman's case

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What about men?

400
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Men don't matter

401
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can raise men's chest

402
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can raise men's chest

403
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I said, I don't know where it is, and from here, the valley is like...

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But it would be nice if it was a woman!

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What would a man do?

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Even if it was a man, you can barely see the valley.

408
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's really...

409
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sensei, this...

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Sensei, this...

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know.

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Even if you shake it, it won't shake!

413
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think it was a woman.

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I was resting yesterday, and I didn't hear it.

415
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with your body?

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What are you doing?

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
At that time, I thought, what are you doing?

418
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But after I got home,

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Muramatsu, that guy...

420
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know.

421
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's about time for you to retire from the entertainment industry and get a job at MPM.

422
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes, yes.

423
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't want to do anything for two or three minutes while I'm waiting for my lunch at the convenience store.

424
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I want to get rid of my laziness, but what should I do?

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What about you?

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't go to magazines anymore.

427
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're the farthest from the magazine.

428
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's right.

429
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What would you do if you were waiting for your lunch at the convenience store?

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why?

431
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If I'm called, I should go.

432
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't even know your name.

433
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If I'm called, I should go.

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Are you a customer at Young Hamburg?

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't care. I don't care.

436
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's embarrassing.

437
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Are you a customer at Young Hamburg?

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't care.

439
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you a customer at Young Hamburg?

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Shut up.

441
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Are you a customer at Young Hamburg?

442
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't care.

443
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's embarrassing.

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Food is one of the cultures.

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're warming up the food, and you pretend not to look at it.

446
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't allow that.

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, no. It's just boring to wait like this.

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes, yes.

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You can just look at it and go in.

450
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You can just look at it and go in.

451
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It doesn't change much.

452
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What kind of lunch is that?

453
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm a little late for that.

454
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It doesn't matter if it's a McDonald's.

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm warming up the food.

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The food I want to eat is being warmed up.

457
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So please listen to that scream.

458
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Please listen to it.

459
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The scream of grilled fish.

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The smile of an egg.

461
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How can I listen to it?

462
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Tell me how to listen to it.

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What?

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
How can I listen to it?

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
How can I listen to it?

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's really...

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's really...

469
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
How can I listen to it?

470
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
How can I listen to it?

471
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Please listen to it.

472
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
How can I do it?

473
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Please listen to it.

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Like this.

475
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes, yes.

476
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Like this.

477
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's amazing.

478
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I was really lonely.

479
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was lonely for two of the Tokyo Dome.

480
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I've been working as a counselor in the children's phone room for five years.

481
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I always leave the lights in my room on and go to sleep.

482
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
My mother scolds me for leaving them on.

483
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
How can I convince my mother?

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You need to have the courage to do anything.

485
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
For example, let's say you dig a hole in a car.

486
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
When you dig a hole, this is a problem.

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You have to go down and apologize.

488
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, you can't apologize.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You can't apologize for this.

490
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What?

491
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's the same.

492
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What is that?

493
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What is that?

494
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's not something to be surprised about.

495
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I didn't notice it at all.

496
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
When your opponent is weak, you can say,

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This is my win.

499
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This is my win.

500
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Be careful!

501
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Bang!

502
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You can use this pattern.

503
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's always like that.

504
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I see.

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
In that sense.

506
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's why I often say that life is about momentum.

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The one with momentum wins.

508
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I see.

509
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why did you leave it on?

510
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Why did you leave it on?

511
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If you say that, it's that pattern.

512
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You can't leave it off.

513
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If you say it with that momentum.

515
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If you say it with that momentum.

516
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Tokihiko-chan!

517
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Tokihiko-chan, who was so weak as a child.

518
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Tokihiko-chan, who was so weak as a child.

519
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The tiger?

520
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The wolf?

521
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It depends on the situation.

522
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
After all.

523
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The wolf is good.

524
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's absolutely necessary.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's right.

526
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There are times when it's quite clear.

527
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
For example, when your girlfriend comes home.

528
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
When you take a bath.

529
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You say, I had long hair.

530
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I see.

531
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
At this time, you can't move around.

532
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Didn't you have long hair?

533
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You can't say that.

534
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
If you say you didn't have short hair.

535
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You can't say that.

536
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I didn't have it.

537
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's not true.

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
My hair is short.

539
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Or.

540
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Didn't you have short hair?

541
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
After saying that.

542
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You can't say that I didn't take a bath here.

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You can't say that.

544
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You can't say that this is my room.

545
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What is this person?
