1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I came to a strange place, but I'm going to do some special training here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the match team!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And this is the match team!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Why are you so lame looking at my uniform?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you just taking pictures?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're so lame!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to start with the basics.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have a teacher here with me today as well.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please come in!

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm an amateur.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Don't yawn!

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What should I start with?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll start with the passes.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You can throw it where it's easier to catch.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You don't have to be particular about the shape.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All you have to do is do it seriously.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll do it!

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please come in!

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can do that much, right?

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll start with Noriyasu, Yamazaki, and Takasu.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Show me what you've got!

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ready, go!

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The sun is burning in the sky. I want to hold it in my hand.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're hitting the side!

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can't do that.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okamoto, then Naguri.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then Keibo.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ready, go!

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The sun is burning in the sky. I want to hold it in my hand.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The grasshopper is holding rice!

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't close it!

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What's next?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Next is the goal.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ready, go!

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't see it!

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're still doing that face!

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Soccer club, soccer club.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, you want to be a soccer player.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ready, go!

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, are you serious?

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ready, go!

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's next?

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Next is 1 on 1.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The one who has the ball, please leave the defense.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The enemy team will come from the other side, right?

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So I'll wait here alone.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Ready, go!

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Keibo-san!

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I just took a picture.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ready, go!

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait a minute!

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry!

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you laughing?

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's been a long time since I played with a child.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Ready, go!

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You guys!

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't see anything!

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll do my best.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ready, go!

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who's dancing?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Damn it!

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want you to come back cleanly!

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Katsumato-san!

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Ready, go!

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What?

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Keibo-san!

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll do my best.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The sun is burning in the sky.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Stand up! Stand up!

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't know anymore!

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What kind of man are you?

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know anymore!

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Aren't you the chief of this program?

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What kind of man are you?

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't you have a little more love?

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What kind of attitude is that?

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm not feeling well.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If you're not feeling well, why don't you do that?

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's not that I'm not feeling well.

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm always like that.

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Your face is creepy.

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Especially your smile.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You have to be careful with your words.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm really nice.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Really.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Where are you nice?

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm really nice.

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're really nice.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't laugh!

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I go to the convenience store myself.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I go to the TV.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have to be careful.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's hard, isn't it?

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
On that bookshelf.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's hard.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have to be more careful when you go out.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're a human.

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You have to be more careful when you're sick.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why are you so serious?

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You used to be a man with a lower back.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You've been a little weird lately.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You've been weird.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why don't you say it twice?

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't say it twice!

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't say it twice!

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you say it twice, I'll beat you up.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's not true.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
For example, when you get home from work,

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
that's enough.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What's that?

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When you get home, there's food, you eat, you take a bath,

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
there's hot water, you use it,

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and when you get out, you pull the blanket,

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and you go to sleep.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's enough!

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
After you get home.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What?

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You cook yourself?

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You don't do the laundry yourself.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You don't wait for the guy with the apron?

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Happy New Year!

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What kind of person are you?

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's what you think.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm a normal person.

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're a pervert.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not a pervert.

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're definitely a pervert.

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's not true.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm not a pervert.

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're not a pervert?

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not a pervert.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you trying to say?

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm just trying to get you to like me.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's definitely not true.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're probably doing that.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're definitely not a pervert.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're wearing a pair of tights.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're probably doing something weird.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're saying weird things.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not a pervert.

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're a pervert.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're saying weird things.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not a pervert.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're really something.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
When you say something like that,

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you don't get the image of it.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't get it.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why would I go back to this boring,

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
tiring house and wear tights

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
when I'm tired?

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I shouldn't be doing that.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're stupid.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's a different kind of physical strength

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
from being boring.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're the only one

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
who's the same as on TV.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's rare.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Normally on TV,

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
people who say stuff like this

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
don't say things like

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you for your hard work.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't say that.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're still the same.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're wearing a pair of tights

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
even though you're a pervert.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're scary.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What should we do?

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What is it?

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's rugby.

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We practiced today.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We went to practice.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a penalty game between you and me.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There are various rules.

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How is it?

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What do you want to be?

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do you want?

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There are various things.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Penguins.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Penguins.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And legs.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Legs.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And what else?

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's a lot of interesting things.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well,

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it seems like there are a few.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There's a place where the ceiling is made of glass.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I think A is better.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What do you mean?

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You mean you look at the audience like this?

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There are people swimming here.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's A.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's A.

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What are you talking about?

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're A, too.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What? I'm A?

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're A, too.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you're A over there,

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think it's A.

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Isn't it scary?

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
A?

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A is not scary, is it?

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But you've never heard of

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
someone who was A, have you?

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What are you going to do if you become an anime character?

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What are you going to do if you become a couple?

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm not going to become an A.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because you're an A, too.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, I'm an A.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're going to have an attitude like an A.

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's not funny.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you going to do?

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What should I do?

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What do you want me to do?

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What?

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What do you want me to do?

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well,

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
what do you want me to do?

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Laugh.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What do you want me to do?

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Cover.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Laugh.

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Have you ever seen a cover in a aquarium?

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Laugh.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a cover, brother.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Laugh.

242
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't look at it.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I thought about it, and the cover came out now.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And that,

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
that,

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Tatsunoo and Shigo.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's floating like this.

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, that's it?

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to take a good picture.

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What are you saying?

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you saying?

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm talking to you.

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That mouth, that,

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the village chief's.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Chiku-chan.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hello, Hama-chan, Mattsun.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
A long time ago, Mattsun said that the nipples were useless, so I didn't need it.

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So, what about cutting off Mattsun's nipples and putting them on auction?

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a pretty expensive thing.

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, no, you can't put it on auction.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, that's.

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you going to take it?

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No, if it's at a good price.

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How much do you want?

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What about this?

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll give you two.

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'd better not have one or two.

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No, it's okay.

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's your nipples.

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you want to do an auction?

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, no, no, it's okay?

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So, I'll do it if I get A2.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How much do you want?

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
10 yen.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You know...

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What is it?

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
My mother, Akiko, raised me to be a beggar.

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
My expensive nipples...

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Expensive or not, that's...

283
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to raise them from now on, Yuka.

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Starting from 10 yen...

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's too much.

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How much do you want?

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
500 yen.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, no, no.

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're pretending to be nice.

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What are you talking about?

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
500 yen.

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
At first it's 500 yen.

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
After that, it's a buy-buy game.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You said you'd buy it for 500 yen.

295
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, I didn't mean that.

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Of course you did.

297
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course you did.

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
First of all...

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If you sell your nipples for 500 yen,

300
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
it's funny, so if you sell it for 500 yen, I'll buy it.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I want to ask you once if you're going to buy it for 500 yen or not.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Of course I will.

303
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But it's for three people.

304
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I see. Everyone's a little worried right now.

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you want it, you don't have to worry.

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Starting from 500 yen.

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
500 yen.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Starting from 500 yen.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
1,000 yen.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
1,000 yen. Anything else? Anything else?

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
2,000 yen.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
2,000 yen.

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
3,000 yen.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
10,000 yen.

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
10,000 yen.

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
10,000 yen.

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What?

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
20,000 yen.

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
20,000 yen.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, hey, hey.

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Think carefully.

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're so stubborn.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you going to use it for?

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's fine.

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Because, you know...

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There's a tower.

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Even in a glass tower.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's a time when it's noisy.

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Are you going to use it as a cushion?

330
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Look at the top and bottom.

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
50,000 yen.

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
50,000 yen.

333
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There's 100,000 yen.

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There's 100,000 yen.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What kind of a person is that?

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're definitely lying.

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a loan.

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you stupid?

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's not cash.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a loan.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can't cut that kind of thing.

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm telling you because I think so.

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're saving up money little by little just for your neck.

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You don't have to look like that.

345
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
After all, 100,000 yen is the ceiling.

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Can you get 200,000 yen?

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll never get it.

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll never get 200,000 yen.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm telling you I can.

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Then cut it.

351
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You can't get 200,000 yen.

352
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There's nothing more than that.

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Your neck.

355
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll tell you.

356
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
100,000 yen.

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
100,000 yen.

358
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
100,000 yen.

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
100,000 yen.

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's right.

361
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's right.

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

363
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What are you guys doing?

364
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What's wrong?

365
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's unusual for you to be so stupid looking at your neck.

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm at my limit.

367
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm serious.

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Seriously.

370
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not kidding.

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm really serious.

372
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If it's for love, I'll make my wife cry.

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's what the singer says.

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you guys agree with that?

375
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Also,

376
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's wrong with that?

377
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What's wrong with that?

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you have any complaints?

379
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you agree with that?

380
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Or are you against it?

381
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Even though I'm a comedian,

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I think it's too selfish.

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you think?

384
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's too selfish.

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's what the singer says.

386
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You know what?

387
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There's no such thing as a comedian.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's no such thing.

389
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's no such thing.

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There's no such thing.

391
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's up to you whether you want to go see her or not.

392
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't think I can go see her when my father dies.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Go see her.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What are you talking about?

395
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know.

396
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
My father doesn't know.

397
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Did you get caught?

398
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I got caught by my father.

399
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I almost got killed by my father.

400
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Don't say that.

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There's a theme park next to the rescue center.

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There is.

403
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There's a theme park next to the rescue center called the Deluxe Pool.

404
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There is.

405
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I went to the pool when I was in elementary school.

406
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The pool with waves.

407
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I can't reach it because it's an adult pool.

408
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm scared.

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why are you asking for money?

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm scared.

411
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can understand that.

412
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The waves are so strong.

413
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They are so strong.

414
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's okay if you can't go in.

415
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The waves are different from the waves I saw as an adult.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It looks like a normal wave from here.

417
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's a child's point of view.

418
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
In the world of children, the waves are scary.

419
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
From a child's point of view.

420
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What are you looking at?

421
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm not looking at anything.

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know what I was thinking.

423
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was holding my head high.

424
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It was strong.

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't stand it.

426
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I thought I wouldn't be able to swim.

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The waves were so strong.

428
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you know?

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
When the wave comes close to death,

430
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I want you to try it at home.

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If you hold your breath as long as you can,

432
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it becomes blue.

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's a danger signal.

434
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't do it anymore.

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's coming out.

436
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a danger signal.

437
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's coming out.

438
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's coming out.

439
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's coming out.

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's a father.

441
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I can't kill it.

442
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's coming out.

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I hugged it.

444
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If you had helped me,

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
it would have been a danger signal.

446
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If you had helped me,

447
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it would have been a danger signal.

448
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's coming out.

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's coming out.

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's coming out.

451
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You have no choice but to die.

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I have no choice but to die.

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Then I locked myself in my shell.

454
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I saw a fairy.

455
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You are too beautiful to summarize.
