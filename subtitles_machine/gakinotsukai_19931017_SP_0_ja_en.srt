1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's been an hour since the show started.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's not a showdown, but it's an opening show.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are a lot of things to do.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I have a special guest today.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I was surprised when I came out for the first time.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Two people over here, two people over here.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
At first I thought it was a speaker.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why are there two people over here?

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've been chasing you for about a week now.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Liar!

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You like Sumo-tori, don't you?

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sumo-tori, Sumo-tori.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why Sumo-tori?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Tobacco, bath, Sumo-tori.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know if it's tobacco or bath.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sumo-tori.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know his face.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sumo-tori.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sumo-tori.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
By the way, I was surprised to see it on TV.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There's a lot of import of boxers now.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The one I was doing last night was a Japanese title.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Japanese champion, Japanese, of course.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No matter how you look at it, the Japanese ranked second is a black person.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not a black person, but it's a Japanese nationality.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's why it's imported.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is the nationality in Japan?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's why you're a black person, so you're really strong.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Japanese champion was KOed in the second round.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you going to do from here?

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I brought an American flag and shook it.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The champion became a Japanese champion.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Even if you're interviewed by a ship, you say thank you.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a strange story.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's strange.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If that's the case, even in the world of sumo.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know. I can't bite a pig.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't think that's strange.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a nationality. Sumo is a Japanese nationality.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't think so.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm saying it's different from when foreigners are doing sumo.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's the difference?

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's different from the moment you say thank you.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's different.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's fast.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's different.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know exactly, but there's a school for sumo.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's different from the moment you say thank you.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's where you're wrong.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's different. You're a black person.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a nationality. It's a Japanese nationality.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing with your head?

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's strange.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But if you can speak Japanese, I think it's okay to forgive each other.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I don't understand.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's because he's important, so I don't understand.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know what the whole sumo world is talking about.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's not it.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not going to do a horror movie.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's hard to speak.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Speak more naturally.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's hard to speak.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's not it.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sweating all over.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm using a lot of strength.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm finally back.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm glad you told me.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm glad you told me.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm glad you told me.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm in the room for a while today.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The pot looks delicious.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How is it?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't stand it.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't stand it.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're hot.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you're hot, I'm hotter.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What happened to the garbage problem?

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's being said in foreign countries.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Japan's privacy.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For example, you live in an apartment, right?

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There's a pretty good woman next door.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's say you have a girlfriend.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You have a girlfriend, don't you?

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Her name is Tanaka.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When I go to the garbage store,

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If I see Tanaka,

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not written as San.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If there's a trash bag called Tanaka,

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want you to see it.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll open it for you.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't have Tanaka's privacy.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You open it.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll leave Tanaka alone.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's okay if you pass by.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why?

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's Tanaka's.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But Tanaka is a good woman.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It doesn't matter if it's a good woman.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It doesn't matter if Tanaka is a good woman.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
When you leave the house,

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you say,

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's Tanaka's,

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll do it.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll definitely do it.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You'll do it, too.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Tanaka is a very good woman.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've been walking around like this.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's disgusting if you walk around like this.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Tanaka is as beautiful as a eel.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's Tanaka's trash bag.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll see it.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you say that, I'll see it.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's right.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's disgusting.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's definitely disgusting.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There are only 23 of them now.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I was doing it on the news.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you go to Sendai,

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's all over there.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There's a guy who throws away a black plastic bag.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's a guy who throws away a black plastic bag.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's a sticker on it.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a warning.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What happens when you put a sticker on it?

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I leave it alone.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's going to happen?

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's going to happen?

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A monster headland.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a parent.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Is that so?

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's how it is.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're walking around like this.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you write Peter,

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What kind of trash do you throw away?

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You'll open it, right?

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can't write Peter.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If you really write Peter,

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think it's a little weird.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Cool Five.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Everyone's alive.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Miyamoto-san and Uchiyama-san are alive.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There are a lot of entertainers living in Tokyo.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There's a problem with entertainers.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There are a lot of entertainers.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you say that Matsumoto lives in a mansion,

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The people in the mansion already know.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They'll find out.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They'll see it.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There's a lot of stuff coming out.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My face is going to turn red.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You don't have to do that.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Put it in your pocket, get in the car,

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'd like you to throw it away on your way to work.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're not going to get electrocuted from the car window.

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why?

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You don't have to do that.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Take it.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Give me a pen.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's getting on my nerves.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Who?

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Me?

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who's getting on your nerves?

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why are you getting on my nerves on stage?

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll tell you in the dressing room.

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll call you at night.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why are you using the industrial year-end?

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're getting on my nerves.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are times when you have to pick up trash.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You have to stop somewhere.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is the last time.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not saying I agree.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's all do a demonstration.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not cool.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't want anyone to do it.

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then I'll lead the way.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Really?

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Really.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll do it.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll watch the news.

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What are you talking about?

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you agree with that, I'll give you a black rubber band.

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's do a demonstration.

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's do it.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Where should we go?

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We should go to the city hall.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, let's go.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Leader.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No matter how many times you tell me to go to the city hall, I can't do it.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's go.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't do it.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If it's 3 o'clock, you have to come at 3 o'clock.

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're always an hour late.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't do it.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you going to say when you get off the city hall?

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When I get off the city hall, if you ask me what I'm doing,

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll go round and round.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For the time being.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you're going to do that, I'll give you a black rubber band.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
For the time being.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's go to the city hall.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
For the time being, let's do a demonstration.

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's do a demonstration.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll talk to you from there.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No, no, I'm sorry I'm going round and round.

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's okay.

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't need that kind of apology.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going round and round because I have a bad intention.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't need that.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can't do that.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can't do that.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's do it.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't do that.

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're being treated like a fool.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't talk much.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can't talk.

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're the leader.

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why am I the leader?

226
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's do that.

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's get a talent.

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's get a talent.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's talk to more talent.

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What do you have in your mind right now?

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Like Heisuke Sugi.

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Even if you put Heisuke Sugi in the anti-transparency.

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know it's Heisuke Sugi, don't you?

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's why you can't do it.

236
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know why.

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll get a handkerchief.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So.

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll go with a talent.

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Who is it?

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Take Wada Akiko.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's nice.

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Is this the guy?

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It would be nice if a Chinese person came.

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's called anti-transparency.

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm not going to use a child.

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Chikitsuki entertainer.

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you so-chan? Grand Prix.

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm the same.

250
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Are you so-chan? Grand Prix.

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I came out to the street corner.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm taking a survey of the people on the road.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The person who was brilliantly shining in the Grand Prix.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's start with the theme of the Grand Prix.

255
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Today's participants, please.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Please take a seat.

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The next is Mr. Otake Yamamoto.

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm used to it.

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I told you not to call me.

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The next is Mr. Ibasuke.

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you know this guy?

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I saw him in the special edition.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But it's not like that.

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not like that.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Haven't you seen it?

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't know what you're doing on TV.

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm doing it just for you.

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The next is Mr. Rasa.

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm Rasa.

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Of course you know Rasa.

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I already know.

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm a fan of Downtown.

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The last is Mr. Matsumoto.

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He seems to have a lot of problems.

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A little more than usual.

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That means you're going to increase the number of enemies.

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm not doing it with that in mind.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you have that many enemies?

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't you know?

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you do it in the hallway, no one will listen to you.

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's just the way it is.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The first question is this.

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're definitely going to the SM club, aren't you?

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You've been on TV for a long time.

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When you're done with work, you're going to the SM club, aren't you?

286
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't think so.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is that so?

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's right.

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's right.

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But after that, you're definitely going to the SM club, aren't you?

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's start with Mr. Otake.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is that so?

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Who is it?

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know.

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that so?

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Mr. Iemoto's answer is...

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm looking forward to it.

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's Masoyoi.

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's what they say.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's not my opinion, so I'll take your opinion.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This guy is a little bit of a ***.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What do you mean?

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you mean?

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What about Raka-chan?

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Mr. Iwai.

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's right.

307
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mr. Iwai is ***.

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I heard that.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I heard that.

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The last one.

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Who is it?

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Nagashima Jr.

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Who do you think it is?

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's start the VTR.

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sure it's Sanoshiro.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yamashiro Shingo.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Junji Takada.

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Kaneki Shimoda.

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yamamori.

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think I can see those tight pants.

321
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Beat Takeshi.

322
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ryu Oshiba.

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Katsura Sanshi.

324
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He's got a pretty high voice.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He's got a pretty high voice.

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Tanaka Yasuo.

327
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Tanaka Yasuo.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Takeshi.

329
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Downtown Matsumoto.

330
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Shibarai.

331
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Sanoshiro.

332
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Ryu Oshiba.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Katsura Sanshi.

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Beat Takeshi.

335
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Junji Takada.

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Junji Takada.

337
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Beat Takeshi.

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Ryu Oshiba.

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sanoshiro.

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Junji Takada.

341
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ryu Oshiba.

342
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mr. Oshiba.

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Ryu Oshiba.

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Mr. Oshiba.

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Ryu Oshiba.

346
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're all wrong.

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's move on.

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So the people don't know the truth, right?

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't say nonsense.

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's move on.

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The next question.

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The next question is...

353
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This one.

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're the son of your parents, Hanahadashi.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What the...

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well...

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Please write it down.

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please.

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I've already written it down.

360
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Please think about it again.

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Please think about it again.

362
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Please think about it.

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Please write it down.

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Otake.

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You can't do that.

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't do that.

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, no, no.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I ran safely because of this man.

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why do I have to respond to everyone's request?

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's good.

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's good.

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's start with Otake.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well...

374
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
A member of the parliament who looks like B-saku.

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I made a mistake and said B-saku.

376
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ivo-san.

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going to add my brother to that.

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Brother.

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Brother.

380
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Who?

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Me.

382
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Kaneda.

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I ran safely because of that.

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right.

386
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know the other one.

387
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Ivo-san.

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well...

389
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was Kanji.

390
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Hiragana.

391
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Ogata Naoto.

392
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Takashima brothers.

393
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Kitashima Mai.

394
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Nakashima Kazushige.

395
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If Shigeo wasn't there...

396
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Shigeo.

397
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't think I'd be in the game.

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Hayashiya Kokuge.

399
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Otsuru Gitan.

400
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Ishida Issen.

401
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I can feel it right away.

402
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Ishida Issen.

403
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Nakashima Kazushige-san.

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Takashima brothers.

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hayashiya Kokuge.

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's not funny at all.

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Otsuru Gitan-san.

408
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Nakashima Kazushige.

409
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Ogata Naoto.

410
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Takashima brothers.

411
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Takashima brothers.

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ishida Issen.

413
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ishida Aise.

414
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Takashima brothers.

415
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now, all of the Takashima brothers in the Grand Prix are out.

416
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you.

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I think that's how popular it is, isn't it?

418
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It reminds me of everyone.

419
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You're following me.

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's move on to the next question.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This one.

422
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You guys should disband your group.

423
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
How long have you guys been doing this?

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's like a draw.

425
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You guys are different from the entertainment world.

426
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Stop it.

427
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You guys should disband your group.

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You guys should disband your group.

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Now, Iguchi-san.

430
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't want to.

431
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't want to. Everyone is laughing.

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is what the public thinks.

433
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now, Raka-chan.

434
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Raka-chan.

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Raka-chan.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is it that bad?

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't know.

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Raka-chan.

439
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You guys are not funny.

440
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You guys are not funny no matter how long you've been doing this.

441
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We're not funny no matter how long we've been doing this.

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We're not funny no matter how long we've been doing this.

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Shut up.

444
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Shut up.

445
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Shut up.

446
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you don't shut up, we're going to broadcast this.

447
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is a bit...

448
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't know.

449
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Kadao-san.

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You guys should draw.

451
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You guys should draw.

452
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Who do you want me to draw?

453
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What do you want?

454
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What do you want?

455
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What do you want?

456
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I drew this.

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Forever.

458
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Say it again.

459
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You guys are not funny.

460
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You guys are not funny no matter how long we've been doing this.

461
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We're not funny no matter how long we've been doing this.

462
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Who do you want?

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm being scolded.

464
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I think this is the same for the red traffic light.

465
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I think this is the same for the red traffic light.

466
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Boys.

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not a boy anymore.

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Dachau Club.

469
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hikaru Genji.

470
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Downtown.

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Tunnels.

472
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Aozora Kyuujikouji.

473
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Dachau Club.

474
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Tsunan.

475
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hikaru Genji.

476
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Roller skates are coming off.

477
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Drifters.

478
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Boys.

479
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Boys.

480
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Ucchan Nanchan.

481
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
B21.

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hikaru Genji.

483
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Boys.

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hikaru Genji.

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Ucchan Nanchan.

486
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hikaru Genji.

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Dachau Club.

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Hikaru Genji.

489
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Roller skates are coming off.

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The red traffic light is still on.

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The world doesn't know the existence of the red traffic light.

492
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I know.

493
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Of course.

494
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't think of anyone.

495
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Here.

496
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're like GonCold.

497
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ucchan.

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let it go.

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let it go.

500
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll answer it.

501
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll put a transition on this question.

502
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I can't put it on just this one.

503
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let it go.

504
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I got it.

505
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You're like GonCold.

506
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What kind of Ucchan?

507
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
GonCold.

508
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm scared.

509
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay, go ahead.

510
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I didn't see it.

511
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I thought I saw it.

512
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It doesn't matter if you saw it.

513
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It doesn't matter if you saw it.

514
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let's start with Otaru.

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ready?

516
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Sakuma.

517
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to win, so don't tell anyone.

518
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I didn't see it.

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm really a man.

520
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't think I'm a man.

521
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't think I'm a man.

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't think I'm a man.

523
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm not going to see it.

524
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm not going to see it.

525
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Sakamoto Issei.

526
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yabasa-chan.

527
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's right. I've never heard of it.

528
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Ready, go!

529
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't get it!

530
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I just remembered!

531
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Ready, go!

532
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's 90%!

533
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't get it!

534
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Otake Makoto.

535
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Mokku.

536
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Otake Makoto.

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Takashima Onii-chan.

538
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Something like that.

539
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Tano Shiro-san.

540
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Mokku-kun.

541
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
His face is sharp, right?

542
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's why.

543
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Downtown's Matsu-chan.

544
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Kejirabi-kun.

545
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Mokku-kun.

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Minamoto-san.

547
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Takada Junji-san.

548
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't know about Tamu-san.

549
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Ruu Oshiba.

550
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Ruu Oshiba.

551
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Tano Shiro.

552
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Tano Shiro?

553
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Because he looks like a pervert.

554
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Downtown's Matsu-chan.

555
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Mokku-kun.

556
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Matsu-chan.

557
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi.

558
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Mokku-kun.

559
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The winner of the Grand Prix is Motoki Masahiro-san!

560
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You're all out!

561
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Otake-san, did you get 2 points?

562
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I got 2 points.

563
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You're underestimating me.

564
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You're popular because you're famous.

565
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Enough!

566
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The last question.

567
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Ah, really?

568
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The last one?

569
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The last question is...

570
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
here!

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You're a *** with a metal in your ***.

572
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
No, I'm not.

573
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can't think of anything.

574
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You're the only one I can think of.

575
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What?

576
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What the f**k are you talking about?

577
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Not this one.

578
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Why don't you make a mosaic for one person?

579
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll accept only the person who says,

580
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
please erase that part.

581
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
One?

582
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yes.

583
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The part that comes out.

584
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The part that comes out.

585
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The part that comes out.

586
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you for waiting for a long time.

587
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
From now on, we will hold the downtown autumn dinner show,

588
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
which is famous for singing and talking.

589
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Everyone, please enjoy the wonderful dinner.

590
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Hello.

591
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is the second time for our dinner show.

592
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes.

593
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Thank you for coming to Sagamiko Hyatt.

594
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you very much.

595
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Thank you.

596
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Don't worry about the food.

597
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The food is also made by a wonderful cook.

598
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yes.

599
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He cooks with his own hands.

600
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes.

601
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The cook...

602
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The chef...

603
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hama-chan, you are so mean.

604
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sorry.

605
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm already crying.

606
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's embarrassing.

607
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm really sorry.

608
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So, let's listen to the first song.

609
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes.

610
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
From Sagamiko Hyatt's number,

611
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
please listen to the song,

612
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Blue Rain.

613
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
OK.

614
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Ah, the blue rain.

615
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It embraces my shoulder and disappears.

616
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Ah, the blue rain.

617
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Ah, the blue rain.

618
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Ah, the blue rain.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Ah, the blue rain.

620
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It embraces my shoulder and disappears.

621
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Ah, the blue rain.

622
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you very much.

623
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Thank you very much.

624
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Hama-chan, you are so mean.

625
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm already crying.

627
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You are so mean.

628
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So, let's listen to the next song.

629
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's listen to the next song.

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
From Venus's number,

631
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
please listen to Kiss on Many.

632
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yes.

633
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Please.

634
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's a song.

635
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's a song.

636
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

637
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's a song.

638
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's a song.

639
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's a song.

640
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a song.

641
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's a song.

642
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's a song.

643
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's a song.

644
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's a song.

645
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can do it!

646
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
OK!

647
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
One up! One up!

648
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Falling into a trap

649
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
A seducing voice invites me

650
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Kiss me in the eyes and laugh

651
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Kiss me in the eyes and laugh

652
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Kiss me in the eyes and laugh

653
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Kiss me in the eyes and laugh

654
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Kiss me in the eyes and laugh

655
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Thank you!

656
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Today, we invited top dancers from New York.

657
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes.

658
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I think it was very exciting.

659
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
After all, there was a lot of fun from New York.

660
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
There was.

661
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
After all, the real thing is different.

662
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's different.

663
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, that's it.

664
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Let's go to the next one before we get excited.

665
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Please listen to Never from Me.

666
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
OK!

667
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Never from Me

668
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We are cooperating with dancers from New York.

669
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
When you're hurt and broken

670
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's a chance to get stronger

671
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Never from Me

672
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Never from Me

673
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Never from Me

674
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Never from Me

675
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:25,800
Thank you very much!

676
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,320
Thank you very much!

677
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,140
Thanks for your support!

678
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,200
Never ever never never speaks

679
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,520
Thank you very much!!

680
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Thank you very much.

681
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Actually, this album was recorded in London.

682
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I wonder why.

683
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,520
When I go to a place called London, I feel very free.

684
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
That's right.

685
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,520
I was told that I made a very confident album.

686
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Then, it's a very difficult thing to say.

687
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
What?

688
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
It's the last song.

689
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Is it over already?

690
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Wait a minute.

691
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
What?

692
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
I have to wait a little longer.

693
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
The audience seems to be mentally prepared.

694
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Is that so?

695
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Yes.

696
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Be careful, audience.

697
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Please sing with the audience.

698
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Yes.

699
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Then, the last song.

700
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Let's burn.

701
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Let's burn.

702
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Thank you.

703
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Let's burn.

704
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Let's burn.

705
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Let's burn.

706
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Let's burn.

707
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Roll up your midsemintheme and make it a inability.

708
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,520
Let's burn.

709
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Shake the red.

710
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Let's burn the place where we can't see the light of the new year

711
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Let's burn the place where we can't see the light of the new year

712
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Let's burn, burn more, burn more

713
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Let's burn the place where we can't see the light of the new year

714
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Thank you very much!

715
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Thank you very much!

716
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,520
See you next month!

717
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,520
See you next month!

718
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Thank you very much!

719
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:58,520
What kind of action does the actor do when the scene of the drama is cut?

720
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I did it once.

721
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Don't do that.

722
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Don't do that.

723
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
In front of people.

724
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

725
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
What are you talking about?

726
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,520
I'm lying, so I'm talking about it.

727
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I did it once, but I was doing it all the time.

728
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

729
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
It's not cool.

730
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I'm talking about it.

731
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I don't like it when you say cut and leave.

732
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I don't like it.

733
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I'm talking about it.

734
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
I was pushing you down and saying,

735
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
I'm talking about it.

736
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm talking about it.

737
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I'm talking about it.

738
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm still doing it.

739
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I'm still doing it.

740
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,520
On the day I was told that it was a love scene.

741
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Bed scene.

742
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,520
That's a little tough.

743
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
I'm saying,

744
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
I'm talking about it.

745
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm scared.

746
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm talking about it.

747
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm talking about it.

748
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
I'm talking about it.

749
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
I can't do it at all.

750
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Really? Why?

751
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
I don't know what to do after that.

752
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,520
That's why I just did it at the time of production.

753
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
It's not cool.

754
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
I did it from the rehearsal.

755
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
I'm talking about it.

756
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,520
I'm talking about it.

757
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm talking about it at the time of production.

758
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm talking about it.

759
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
That's not it.

760
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
I'm talking about it.

761
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
You may be a teapot.

762
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,520
But your tongue is like a devil.

763
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,520
If you show your tongue, it's like this.

764
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Well,

765
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
I can't do it.

766
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I don't know.

767
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, I can't do it for the rest of my life, so it's okay.

768
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,520
I always think this is love when I'm with someone else.

769
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Please tell me the difference.

770
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Well, isn't it a relationship that doesn't go that far when you're in love?

771
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
No sex?

772
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Yes.

773
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Is it love that there is no sex?

774
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Not yet.

775
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Well, I'll say it.

776
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Well, you say that.

777
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,520
The period of love is short.

778
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,520
It's about two hours.

779
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Is there such a thing?

780
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Love is about eating.

781
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Idiot!

782
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
There is love, right?

783
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
It's love until you have sex.

784
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
It's love when you have sex.

785
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Where does love come from?

786
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
It's difficult.

787
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,520
But I'm not wearing it until I take off my clothes.

788
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
It's still love.

789
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,520
This is love.

790
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,520
It's still love if it's a bra and panties.

791
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,520
I don't know if I can do that.

792
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,520
It's still love.

793
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
It's still love.

794
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
It's a bra and panties.

795
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
Right?

796
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Yes.

797
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Pring!

798
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Bopopring!

799
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,520
It's still love.

800
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
It's still love.

801
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Still love.

802
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Oh.

803
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Kyukyu kyukyu.

804
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Still love.

805
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
Still love.

806
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Still love.

807
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Still love.

808
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Why?

809
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Zaku!

810
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,020
Sawa!

811
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,020
You still love me?

812
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Eh?

813
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,520
You still love me?

814
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
You still love me?

815
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Why?

816
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,520
Why do you take out a sketchbook and draw this?

817
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
It's an art.

818
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
It's an art.

819
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
You still love me?

820
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Sawa!

821
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,520
It doesn't matter if you stand upright or not.

822
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You still love me.

823
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,520
You still have a pose.

824
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Well, well, well.

825
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
You still love me?

826
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,520
What are you doing there?

827
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm in love.

828
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,520
That's right.

829
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Up to this point, it's love.

830
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
It's just...

831
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
It's just.

832
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,520
I've been in this situation all the time.

833
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Pichan.

834
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Pichan.

835
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Pichan.

836
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Pichan.

837
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
What if I'm in love?

838
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
What about this?

839
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,520
That's strange.

840
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
That's strange.

841
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
What if I'm in love?

842
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Why? That's OK.

843
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
That's OK.

844
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Why?

845
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,520
If I'm naked in front of someone who's not conscious of anything,

846
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I won't be in love, right?

847
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Well.

848
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Everyone, come with me.

849
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
He's pulling something.

850
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
I see.

851
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
He's in a state of acceptance.

852
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Well, I understand that it changes from sex to love.

853
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Certainly.

854
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Right?

855
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
If you have sex, it's love.

856
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
Pichan.

857
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Please stop Pichan.

858
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Who is it?

859
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
You can stop him.

860
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Let's go stop him together.

861
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Who is it?

862
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Who is Pichan?

863
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Who is it?

864
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Please stop him.

865
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
This is what it means.

866
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
I see.

867
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Right?

868
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
It means to stop at home.

869
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
No, no.

870
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
You don't want to stop Pichan at home, do you?

871
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
No.

872
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
I don't know what kind of person he is.

873
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
He's called Pichan.

874
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Right?

875
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,520
I'm nervous when Pichan comes.

876
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
I don't know what to do.

877
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
I don't know what to prepare.

878
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
Should I use a toothbrush?

879
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Can I wear my pajamas?

880
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
I don't know.

881
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm nervous when Pichan comes.

882
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
I enjoy watching the show every week.

883
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
By the way, why are there so many P's in the show?

884
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
What are you talking about?

885
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Do you get scared in the show?

886
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
If you're frustrated, tell me.

887
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
There are a lot of P's in the show.

888
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
There are a lot of P's in the show.

889
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
There are a lot of P's in the show.

890
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
So, today...

891
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
I'll show you.

892
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
I'll give you an hour.

893
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
I'll give you an hour.

894
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
I'll show you without you knowing.

895
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
I'll show you without you knowing.

896
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Well...

897
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
If I do this...

898
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Of course, I'll air this.

899
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
I might turn Japanese celebrities into enemies.

900
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I might turn Japanese celebrities into enemies.

901
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
What?

902
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Who are you?

903
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I want to do it.

904
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
First of all, PR.

905
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
PR.

906
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Please take a look.

907
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
If you're frustrated, tell me.

908
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I'll show you.

909
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
This is the material that was broadcasted.

910
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
The guy who married Nishiki.

911
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
He's a bad guy.

912
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
But,

913
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
He's the most difficult guy to deal with.

914
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
He's the most difficult guy to deal with.

915
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
This is...

916
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
You're the gorilla man, right?

917
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
The dirty thing is that the producer who joined your team...

918
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
The dirty thing is that the producer who joined your team...

919
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
It was dirty.

920
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
The other day, I was going to tackle.

921
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
No, no.

922
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
I was going to tackle.

923
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I was going to tackle.

924
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
It was a great show.

925
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
The writer of my team, Takasu.

926
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
The writer of my team, Takasu.

927
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Kouhaku, which one will win?

928
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
I'll be the white one.

929
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
If there's a happening,

930
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
If there's a happening,

931
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I'll be the one.

932
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
If there's a happening,

933
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I'll be the one.

934
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
This is a serious story.

935
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I think it's getting more and more exposed.

936
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
I think it's getting more and more exposed.

937
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Even in a five-man group,

938
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Even in a five-man group,

939
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Even in a five-man group,

940
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Wow!

941
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
A comedian marries an amateur woman, right?

942
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
A comedian marries an amateur woman, right?

943
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
It's like...

944
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
It's like...

945
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
It's like...

946
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
If you show this without a P,

947
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
If you show this without a P,

948
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
I can't do it.

949
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
You guys are with us today.

950
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
You guys are with us today.

951
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
By the way,

952
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
You can watch this broadcast without a P.

953
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
Of course.

954
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,520
You guys are so fast.

955
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
This is a key point.

956
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
I've been hiding it with a P.

957
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
I've been hiding it with a P.

958
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
A broadcast without a P.

959
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Let's watch it.

960
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
That guy who got married to Konishi-Ki,

961
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
That guy who got married to Konishi-Ki,

962
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
He's got a bad head.

963
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
But the hardest thing in a married couple is...

964
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
But the hardest thing in a married couple is...

965
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
But the hardest thing in a married couple is...

966
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,520
It's a good match.

967
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
It's a good match.

968
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
That was nice.

969
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
That was nice.

970
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
If you use the same material as me,

971
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
If you use the same material as me,

972
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
The string is cut.

973
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,520
The string is cut.

974
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
You guys are so good.

975
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
You guys are so good.

976
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:12,520
However, there are times when you can say that it's okay, right?

977
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:18,520
For example, it's okay for us to say that our fiancée was rude, right?

978
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,520
That's not enough!

979
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
That's not it!

980
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,520
That's not it!

981
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:37,520
Instead of that, we can say, ****** fiancée, ****** fiancée is not okay!

982
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
That was awful, too!

983
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,520
That was awful, too! ****** fiancée, ******

984
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Yes! I'm not like that, but if you say that I'm more ugly than ****** fiancée, that's really bad!

985
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Really ugly!

986
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,520
How can you have such a bad personality?

987
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Well, that's just a matter of nature.

988
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
The player's wife is pretty beautiful, isn't she?

989
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Oh, really?

990
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Yeah.

991
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,520
The f***ing fiancée...

992
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Well, well...

993
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,520
It's so ugly that I can't even explain it in words.

994
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
It's a big deal.

995
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:22,520
It's a big deal.
