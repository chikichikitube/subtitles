I'm scared.

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you okay?

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The end.

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go.

Come to see me again.

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The magic carpet is over.

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll put up a parade for the next customer.

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Next customer.

Welcome.

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The time has come.

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The technical parade will begin.

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please take a look.

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Technical parade, please.

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The lights are beautiful.

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The end.

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The lights are beautiful.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Are you ready?

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Dad.

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go to the observatory for your dad.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to the observatory.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Dad, I'm going to the observatory.

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Dad, please be careful.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Excuse me.

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please take a look at the observatory.

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you very much.

124
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Dad, you're lucky today.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a observatory like a technical parade.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you very much.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is the exit.

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The observatory is over.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I only have two left.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm lucky.

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Welcome.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Pirates.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Pirates, please.

135
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Pirates.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is my favorite, Pirates.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm lucky.

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have Pirates left.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please take a seat.

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Pirates.

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please.

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Pirates.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Pirates, please.

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please be careful.

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is the end.

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm lucky.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I thought Pirates would be gone.

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you very much.

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please remember that I have a pool.

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you very much.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Welcome.

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Please come in.

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm surprised.

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm lucky.

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The second parade is about to begin.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There is a parade with lights.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The second parade is about to begin.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Pirates, please.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The surface is beautiful.

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's shining.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm lucky.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm lucky.

164
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was given a coffee cup and a magic carpet.

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm lucky.

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Octopus.

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Octopus, please.

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Octopus, please.

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Please enjoy it.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Octopus is about to start.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Please move.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Thank you very much.

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you very much everyone.

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is the end of Mini Toshimaya.

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please come again.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you very much.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you very much.

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you very much.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello.

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are very energetic.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm a fool.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think the audience today is listening to Team Zero for a longer time than listening to us.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now we have a special edition.

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What?

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm a little hungry.

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm wearing a lot of clothes.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm wearing a lot of clothes for the body.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So today Team Zero is a child's play.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We are a child's play.

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The story just now will be on air.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I really like birds.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm free.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I really can't do it today.

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've been saying a lot of things until now, but I really can't do it.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There are times when I write.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're touching your chin every now and then.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What happened recently?

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did something happen?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hana-san passed away.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
After all, a comedian's life is short.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is that so?

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I've been an actor for a long time.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There is no job that is as stressful as a comedian.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is that so?

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's right.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's what I wrote in the weekly magazine.

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If the weekly magazine said it was true, it was true in your case.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's different.

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's different.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's different.

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's right, but it's true to some extent.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because he seems to have a great attitude.

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can see that he seems to be great.

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He's a little stubborn, isn't he?

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
His courage is being dispersed.

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know about that.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know about that.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Have you ever done it?

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A little.

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you think that he was a lowly guy at that time?

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's it.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I went in and there was a pool in front of the studio.

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I saw him and thought,

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He's a monkey.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He's a monkey.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Then,

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I saw the script like this.

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's amazing.

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Everyone said,

238
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I saw him and thought,

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He's a monkey.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I saw him and thought,

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He's a monkey.

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I didn't say hello.

244
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He's a monkey.

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He's a monkey.

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm tired.

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm tired.

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's ridiculous.

249
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's ridiculous.

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't think so.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't think so.

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But I didn't see that.

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I didn't talk to him.

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But that attitude is a little.

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's a little.

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's a little.

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You should have said hello properly.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know.

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I saw it once.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You've seen it.

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
For the moment,

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You can say,

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's fine if it's just this much.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But it's fine if it's this much.

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If it's like this.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll make it a bit more clear.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I won't say, thank you.

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But it's fine.

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's a bit too much.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why is that?

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't want to say bad things about you, but...

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're saying, aha?

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're saying aha at a place like that?

274
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Other things...

275
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're saying that?

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What are you?

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We've talked about a lot of things, but I...

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I like you.

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I like you, so I'm thinking of getting your autograph.

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I really like you.

281
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I like you as a man.

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's just that...

283
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Before I entered this world, I was like, I hate this guy, I hate that guy.

284
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But when I met a lot of people in this world and talked to them,

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
there wasn't anyone I didn't like that much, right?

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There wasn't anyone I didn't like, right?

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, no, no.

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's not that, I'm more angry!

289
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's talk about men and men more.

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, no, really.

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you have something?

292
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Something you didn't like at first?

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Something you didn't like?

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There are people I don't like.

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Who are they?

296
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's not bad at first, right?

298
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But when you look at them, they're amazing people.

299
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Who are they?

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There are a lot of people like that, right?

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's why I really think that this world isn't that bad.

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's right.

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I really think that.

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Is that so?

305
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah.

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In the past, there was a time when you hated this guy or that guy.

307
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So who is that?

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Who is that?

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Who is that?

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wait a minute, did you have something?

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You had something, didn't you?

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Who is that?

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Who is that?

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, sometimes.

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There are people like that.

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There are a lot of young actors like that.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, really?

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I misunderstand something.

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's okay, who is that?

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
For example, who do you think you're misunderstanding?

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, um...

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you want to cut that out?

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Tokiyama Goro.

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Who is that?

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's no good.

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you about to cry?

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm about to cry.

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's already late today.

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It doesn't matter if it's good or bad.

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What are you talking about?

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
On the contrary, what are you talking about?

332
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then you guys should take a good picture on Monday.

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Try it.

334
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What?

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Try it.

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's such a big deal.

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You're hiding.

338
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're having sex.

339
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Try it.

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a lot of trouble.

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's true.

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I thought it would be more fun to be an entertainer.

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In that sense, there are restrictions in life.

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There are restrictions.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There are no restrictions at all.

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I want to take it off and do it.

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're taking it off.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're taking it off enough.

349
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What's the hardest thing for me is that I can't go to the beach in the summer.

350
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's really hard.

351
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You can't go to the beach.

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You can't feel anything.

353
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do something in the room.

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I used to do scuba diving in peace.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What is scuba diving?

356
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is scuba diving.

357
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's why I want to do it more.

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I want to do it like this.

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I want to hit and hit.

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I really don't like it.

361
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can't walk on the road with a hat on.

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm walking in peace.

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm going to kill you.

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't make as much money as I thought.

365
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll make it clear.

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I have 180,000 yen in my hand.

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I've been on TV so much.

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I only have 180,000 yen.

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know what it is.

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I was pulled 180,000 yen.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I thought it was a better business.

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I thought it was a more popular life.

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's not like that.

374
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What are you talking about?

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You've been talking about me lately.

376
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're ugly, but I'm not.

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You have a plastic surgery.

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why?

379
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I've said it many times.

380
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't have a plastic surgery.

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, no, no, no.

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you make fun of me, I feel sorry for you.

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'll make you look a little more beautiful.

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sure that woman won't stop her father.

386
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm going to put you in a bra.

387
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's a scam.

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to break the rice and turn it around.

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think my father is big.

390
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm going to break the rice and turn it around.

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm going to break the rice and turn it around.

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was trying to call you for this.

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's not good.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You have a pretty bad eye.

395
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm going to do something about it.

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not going to do anything about it.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What's that?

398
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You can't tell from the top of your clothes?

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I still don't know.

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's a scam.

401
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You have a pretty bad eye.

402
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If you do this, something will fall off.

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Something will fall off.

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What's going to fall off?

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a scam.

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
When I'm using the bathtub, there's always someone in front of me.

407
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They try to scoop it out, but it's hard to get rid of it.

408
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What is it?

409
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a scam.

410
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What is it?

411
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I already know the answer.

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why?

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's the way to say it.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're trying to get rid of it, but it won't fall off.

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can't get rid of it like this.

416
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
How did you get rid of it?

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I see.

418
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What is it?

419
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I see.

420
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think there's something in the right ear.

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The secret is in the right ear.

422
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's in the right ear.

423
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What about the one without the ear?

424
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The one without the ear is...

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The one with the ear is hard to get rid of.

426
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I see.

427
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But the amount of the secret is different for each person.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I see.

429
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There's a lot of them.

430
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You don't have to open it.

431
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's already fallen off.

432
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I feel sorry for the ones with so many secrets.

433
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I see.

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There's one more.

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why is there a plastic thing on the handle of a bicycle?

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It looks fun.

437
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's waving in the wind.

438
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Idiot.

439
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Idiot.

440
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The tricycles sold at MUJI are...

441
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They're cheap.

442
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So they're not so cute when kids ride them.

443
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's like when they're shining.

444
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But that doesn't explain it.

445
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Kids can enjoy it.

446
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's waving.

447
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's waving in the wind.

448
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Do kids like it?

449
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Kids like it.

450
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't know if kids like it.

451
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It looks fun, right?

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Why is Matcha so cute?

453
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm a fan of Matcha.

454
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Matcha is more attractive than the Mont Blanc cake in front of you.

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Please continue to be a lovely Matcha.

456
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I love you the most in the world.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Idiot.

458
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I really think so.

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What's amazing about you is that you can read letters like that yourself.

460
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Why?

461
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're a man.

462
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's true.

463
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You're a manly man.

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If I were a woman, I'd want to be hugged by you.

465
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No way.

466
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If I were a man, I'd bite my tongue.

467
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If I were a woman, I'd want to be hugged by you.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No way.

469
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm a manly man.

470
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Idiot.

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There's no man like me.

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Idiot.

473
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I thought you were done with your homo.

474
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But you look like you have a lot of hair.

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't need a character like that.

476
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm serious.

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I think I'm perfect.

478
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's up to you.

479
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everyone thinks they're perfect.

480
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm not as bad as everyone thinks I am.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think everyone thinks so.

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Even the audience here thinks I'm ugly.

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Even if there's no ugly woman, I can laugh.

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It doesn't matter to me.

485
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Really?

486
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yes.

487
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Humans are scary.

488
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So are you.

489
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I think I'm perfect.

490
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But when I look at you,

491
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
your nose is like this.

492
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And your chin is like this.

493
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's up to you.

494
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's up to you.

495
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's all I can say.

496
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
When I look at you, you're cool.

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
When I look at you, you're funny.
