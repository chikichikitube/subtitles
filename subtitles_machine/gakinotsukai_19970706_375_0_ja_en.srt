1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good evening!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good evening!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's been a while.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, it's been a while.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hong Kong has also been converted.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You know, the other day...

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well...

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I always...

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, there was a bit of it in the opening today.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You said, M is M, right?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, yes.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was wondering how far M would go.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The other day, I tried the Ojou-sama course.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's not Jou-sama course, though.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ojou-sama course?

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There's a Ojou-sama course.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a bit soft, isn't it?

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, it's a bit soft.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I tried that, though.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What do you think about this?

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was lacking.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, rather than lacking, it's a bit different, after all.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You know, it's like this, right?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well...

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You said, I wonder if you could show me a lot of things.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well...

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Stop it, Soso.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Stop it, Ega.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, well, Ega.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I wonder if you could show me a lot of things.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you really doing it like this?

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's true.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
At that point, you were like, ah!

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
At that point, you were like, ah!

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
At that point, you were like, ah!

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ah, I see.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
At that point, you were like, ah!

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I get it.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And then...

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have to take a bath.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then again, I have to, well...

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What was up with you in that moment?

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was in a standing non-stable position.

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What?

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Out of the blue?

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, it was.

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And then, I was told, please go to sleep.

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then, I went to sleep.

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
At that time, the young lady came and pulled on me, and went,

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
At that time, the young lady came and pulled on me, and went,

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What about it?

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's funny.

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's funny.

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Miss, it's funny.

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It was really fast.

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was really fast.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It was like this.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It was like this.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
At that time, I was really embarrassed and excited.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I thought I wanted to be like that.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you understand?

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I understand.

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But surprisingly, I didn't feel angry or embarrassed at all.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What do you mean?

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, it was normal.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your legs were stretched, but it was normal.

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It wasn't normal. I didn't feel anything.

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I see.

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That means I didn't feel anything.

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What didn't you feel?

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I didn't feel anything.

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't think that's true.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You didn't feel anything.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I thought you wanted to show me something.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, no, no, no.

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What did you feel?

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It was M.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
S doesn't have that.

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know about that.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Miss, that's true.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is that so?

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
S doesn't have that at all.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're a little S, aren't you?

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm a little S.

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Either way, it's annoying to be in a situation like that.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What?

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you want me to show you a lot of things?

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, yes, yes.

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What I'm told comes to me.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I'll never be in that situation.

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why does that come to me?

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're telling me a lot of good things.

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's why I don't like M at that stage.

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's a good person.

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why is he a good person?

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want you to show me a lot of things.

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're telling me.

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no, no, no.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's not true.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's not true at all.

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought he was a good person.

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's not true.

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's not true at all.

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What else did you do?

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I had a lot of things.

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I had a lot of things.

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I had a lot of things.

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You have a lot of tools.

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can't use it.

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't use it.

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't use it.

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't use it.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can't say that.

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't say that.

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm doing it, but I'm not excited at all.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're a good person.

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I always...

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I want to thank the guardian spirit who protects me.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
When can I see the guardian spirit?

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He said he was behind me.

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When can I see the guardian spirit?

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He said he was behind you.

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can see him if he's around here.

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can see him.

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's not true.

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Where is he?

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's right behind me.

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Right behind you?

135
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How much distance do you keep?

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sticking close to him.

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're sticking close to him.

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're sticking close to him.

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That means you can't see him even if you look back.

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can't see him.

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can't see him.

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right?

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't see him.

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When can I see him?

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Can I tell you a serious story?

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A serious story.

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go ahead.

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The guardian spirit...

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Actually, this is a lie.

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It never comes with you to the toilet.

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why is that?

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It never comes with you to the toilet.

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's privacy.

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Who said that?

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I read it in a book.

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I didn't say it was privacy.

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So if you want to see the guardian spirit,

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's best to poop.

159
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I see.

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a lie.

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's a lie?

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The guardian spirit.

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What do you mean?

164
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For example, you're pooping, right?

165
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then you're just waiting outside.

166
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's different.

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You don't bite no matter what.

168
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't smoke.

169
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're just waiting.

170
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where's the guardian spirit?

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
My guardian spirit is in the toilet.

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're just waiting, right?

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It never comes with you to the toilet.

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It never comes with you to the toilet.

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When you see the guardian spirit,

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
if you hear something flowing,

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you'll stop smoking.

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't have to do that.

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You don't have to get caught.

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It reacts to the sound of the toilet.

181
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you do this once,

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Look at me.

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Look at me.

184
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can already see it.

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's going on?

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What does it look like?

187
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's better not to ask.

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It looks good.

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well...

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not everyone is human.

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's all I can say.

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're human, aren't you?

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm a regent.

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're a bad regent.

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not bad.

196
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm just strong.

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What does it look like?

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What?

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What does it look like?

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It looks good, right?

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, let me tell you.

202
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a squid.

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Moreover, it's a mongo.

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A mongo squid?

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It depends on the person.

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Among the squids, it's said to be the most evil.

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a mongo squid.

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Be careful.

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Even though I've calmed down recently,

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
at one point,

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
all my cell phone memory

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
was filled with a girl's phone number.

213
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I have a question for Mach-chan.

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, yes, yes.

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't get rid of the girl's phone number

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that I can't find anymore

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
from my cell phone memory.

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What's Mach-chan's criteria

219
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
for getting rid of the memory?

220
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, when a woman is gentle,

221
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
she'll get excited.

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's better to get rid of it instantly.

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Instantly?

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Instantly.

225
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What do you mean instantly?

226
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You shouldn't get too excited.

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you talking about?

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're the one who gets excited, aren't you?

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's me.

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's your criteria for getting rid of the memory?

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, when she calls me,

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
when she says she doesn't use it anymore,

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're the one who got killed!

234
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're the one who got killed!

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The opposite, the opposite!

236
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're the one who got killed while crying.

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're the one who got killed while crying.

238
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then where are you going to throw it away?

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know!

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're the one who got killed while crying.

241
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're really really scary!

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're the one who got killed while crying.

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's delicious when you cook ramen.

244
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then, seriously,

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
if I call you twice and you still don't answer, will you hang up?

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you talking about?

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm serious right now.

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm the type of person who gets chased rather than chased.

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're so cool!

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm the jelly type.

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, I don't think I can fit into that type.

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, no, no, you're the Tom type.

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What kind of jelly do you think I am?

255
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm Jelly Fujiwara.

256
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It became popular in some schools in Osaka.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's called Ossan Tataki.

259
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who came up with this?

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Do you know it?

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I know it.

262
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What is it?

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's written there, so I'll read it for you.

264
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know it, right? Ossan Tataki.

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know about that.

266
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Even if you look at me like that...

267
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Read it! Ossan Tataki!

268
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The rules of Ossan Tataki.

269
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ossan can't do anything.

270
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You draw a circle, and you put in a person who plays the role of Ossan.

271
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes, Ossan.

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And on top of the line of the circle, there's an old lady standing there.

273
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the old lady.

274
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The people around you call the old lady Ossan,

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and kick and hit her.

276
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The old lady blocks that.

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think it's the other way around.

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The old lady on the circle is being attacked by people outside the circle,

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and you're trying to block that?

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The old lady goes like this.

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Stop it! Stop it!

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ossan, what are you going to do?

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll kick her from here.

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you doing?

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you doing?

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's give it a try.

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hey!

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm going to do Ossan Tataki now!

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Did you hear what I just said?

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Did you understand the rules?

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Should we decide on Ossan?

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let's decide on Ossan.

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're all Ossan.

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I lost.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're Ossan.

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There's one old lady.

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's decide on the old lady.

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's decide on the old lady.

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We'll decide on the other person.

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The other person.

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We'll decide on the other person.

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

309
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm protecting you!

311
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Everyone is looking at you!

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm protecting you!

313
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He ran away!

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm protecting you!

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm protecting you!

316
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm protecting you!

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm going to do Ossan.

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ossan...

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't like Ossan.

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's painful!

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He's painful, right?

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He doesn't think much about his seniors or juniors.

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Should we change the old lady?

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's change the old lady.

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can stay as Ossan.

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's change the old lady.

327
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to change the old lady.

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I want to change the old lady.

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The old lady should only be touched.

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I know.

331
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is the battlefield.

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait a minute.

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Wait a minute.

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

337
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
