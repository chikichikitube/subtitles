Let's make a show with erotic language

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,320
This is for some extent

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's just leave it as it is

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,780
Today, without the two of us, we're going to invite the best.

00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,780
This person is amazing.

It's Froggy!

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,780

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,780
Thank you for coming.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,780
Today, we have two wonderful guests.

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,780
Wow, it's a surprise.

17
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,780
Did you see it?

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm so happy.

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,780
Froggy, you came alone today, right?

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,780
That's right.

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,780
When I'm alone, I always act like a woman.

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,780
Is that so?

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,780
Froggy!

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,780
When you're alone, you'll be told a lot of unpleasant things, right?

25
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,780
Don't you do that?

26
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,780
Something like, let me do it.

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Or, let's do it.

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,780
Unfortunately, I don't do that.

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,780
You don't?

30
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,780
Yes.

31
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,780
If you're walking down the street and you see Froggy, you want to talk to her, right?

32
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,780
That's right.

33
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,780
Please talk to her.

34
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,780
Please talk to Spelman.

35
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,780
Shall we start?

36
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
Yes.

37
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,780
Shall we start?

38
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,780
Yes.

39
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
Let's start with a gentle one.

40
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,780
A gentle one.

41
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
Yes.

42
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Tama.

43
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,780
Tama.

44
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Oh, is it okay if I say it?

45
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
No, it's fine.

46
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
Is it okay?

47
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,780
Don't worry about it.

48
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,780
Mara.

49
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,780
I said it softly.

50
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,780
Even if you say ra, it's fine.

51
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,780
It's fine, right?

52
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,780
Ra-ge.

53
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,780
Ra-ge.

54
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
Ge.

55
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
Ge.

56
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Ge?

57
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
It's fine.

58
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
There's no ge.

59
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,780
There isn't.

60
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
There isn't.

61
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,780
But, when I do the velatio, I don't know what to do.

62
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,780
Who said that?

63
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
That's right.

64
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,780
That's why, if you want to make it a ge,

65
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,780
if you want to make it a ge,

66
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
I'll make it a ge.

67
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
Ge.

68
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Ge.

69
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,780
Gezori.

70
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,780
Ah, I see.

71
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
It's gezori.

72
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Gezori's ri, right?

73
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Yes.

74
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Gezori is always Ogawa Natsumi-san's ge.

75
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
That's funny.

76
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Then, let's call it Rinbyo.

77
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,780
By the way, have you experienced it?

78
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
What?

79
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
Have you experienced Rinbyo?

80
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Ah, I've experienced gejirami once.

81
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:36,780

82
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,780
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

83
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
Let's see.

84
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
Is it ri or ya?

85
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Yes.

86
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Well...

87
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
She's in trouble.

88
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
She's in trouble.

89
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,780
She's in trouble.

90
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Well...

91
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Yarigaegaeshi.

92
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780
What?

93
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,780
What?

94
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,780
What?

95
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Well, this Nobutoitakumashi Yarigaeshi is called Yarigaegaeshi.

96
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
This is the new trend of the 21st century.

97
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Is that so?

98
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
It's a trendy word.

99
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
Shi...

100
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Shikko.

101
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Ah, that's wonderful.

102
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
It's also said that you like to drink it.

103
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
Who said that?

104
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
No, no, no.

105
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Yes, you like to drink it.

106
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Yes.

107
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,780
Well...

108
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Kondoumu.

109
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
Kondoumu.

110
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
That's right.

111
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
It's a condom that you've never used.

112
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,780
I've never used a condom.

113
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
You don't use condoms, do you?

114
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
That's right.

115
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,780
I use a face shower every day.

116
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
Thank you very much.

117
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780

119
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
It's Kondoumu.

120
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
There's a word called Muse.

121
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,780
That's wonderful.

122
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
That's right.

123
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,780
I'm a woman, so I don't have any experience with Muse.

124
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
That's right.

125
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,780
In the case that you followed me,

126
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,780
I would like to express my gratitude and give you a wakige.

127
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,780
That's wonderful.

128
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Please take it off.

129
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,780
Can I take it off?

130
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,780
No, it's a pleasure to take it off.

131
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,780
A little more.

132
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
That's wonderful.

133
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
That way of taking it off.

134
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
I don't think it's the first time you've taken it off.

135
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Last night, you actually took off your lover's wakige.

136
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
You showed it in your fingers.

137
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Hey, I'm not going home.

138
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
Let me stay here.

139
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780

157
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780

Well, thinking of how you've said that, it seems here that the woman's breasts are quite big.

196
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
There's eight tiene in here.

197
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
There's eight tane.

198
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Who is that?

199
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,940
I think it's nice.

200
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,440
Does everyone know this person?

201
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Man, it's really cold.

202
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
No, really.

203
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Yes?

204
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
It's that.

205
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
What is it?

206
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
I think Nina-san has a slight cold.

207
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
What is it?

208
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I don't know if there are people who don't have a cold.

209
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,440
But, maybe there are people who don't think so.

210
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
What is it?

211
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
I really work hard.

212
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
What is that?

213
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
No, but I don't think so.

214
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
I wonder if everyone doesn't think so.

215
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,440
But I really work hard.

216
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
No, really.

217
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Even now, if I'm a little tired, I fall down.

218
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm that kind of person.

219
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
No, it's not like that.

220
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,440
You've just been working as a regular.

221
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
That's right, but I'm tired.

222
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Really?

223
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Yes.

224
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I think the three things that a regular can do are the most important.

225
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Really?

226
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Yes.

227
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
It's important to die, right?

228
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes, the three things are the most important.

229
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
What is it?

230
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,440
You work three days a week and rest four days a week.

231
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
No, but I've been working in Osaka and Tokyo for seven months now.

232
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Well, yes.

233
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I have to work hard.

234
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
You've been working hard for seven months, haven't you?

235
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
No, no, no, no.

236
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Let's make it three.

237
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
What do you want me to do?

238
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
You can leave the kids and stand up.

239
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Stand up?

240
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,440
The kids are free to do whatever they want, so it's the easiest for us.

241
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Let's leave this.

242
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I'll leave the kids.

243
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Then I'll go to Japan.

244
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Well, let me tell you.

245
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm doing a water show.

246
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm going to the water show.

247
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm not doing it.

248
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Are you saying that?

249
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm going to the water show on Wednesday.

250
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
What is that?

251
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
It's a dream.

252
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
It's a bad title.

253
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
It's a dream.

254
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I don't want to help you.

255
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Let's stop.

256
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm getting old.

257
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,440
What are you talking about?

258
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I want to do more hobbies.

259
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I want to do a lot of things like horse riding.

260
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
What kind of face is that?

261
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
What kind of face is horse riding?

262
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I want to do it.

263
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
I want to do it.

264
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,440
I have a lot of days off.

265
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,440
I have a lot of days off, but I don't want to spend it.

266
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,440
I want you to stop this.

267
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,440
I've been telling you this for a long time.

268
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
You can't go around.

269
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I can't even tell you how much I'm tired.

270
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I'm not tired.

271
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I can do it.

272
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm writing a fan letter.

273
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm writing a fan letter.

274
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
That's why I'm saying it's a dream.

275
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
But the fan letter can be written.

276
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
You guys are getting in the way of my free time.

277
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Do you write that?

278
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
What fan do you write?

279
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,440
When I came back from Osaka, I was on the Shinkansen. It was really hard, but I thought I shouldn't say it was that hard.

280
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I thought I shouldn't say it was that hard.

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
So I took a taxi to Shin-Oda.

282
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
The driver said,

283
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm from Tokyo.

284
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
I said, Where are you from now?

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
He said, I'm going to the radio.

286
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
From now on, the radio!

287
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Ha!

288
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,440
That's a lot of work!

289
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
That's a lot of work!

290
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
That's a lot of work!

291
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
That's what you do!

292
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
I went into the radio.

293
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
I asked him,

294
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
You look like you're in trouble.

295
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
And then,

296
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
He said,

297
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
He said, Bueh!

298
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,440
That's a lot of work!

299
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
That's a lot of work!

300
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Bueh! Bueh! Bueh!

301
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
That's what you do!

302
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I can't do it!

303
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm not good at drawing.

304
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm not good at drawing.

305
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
I can't do that.

306
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I can't do that.

307
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Because of you, I had a hard time yesterday.

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
What?

309
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I had to go to Kyoto yesterday.

310
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Kyoto.

311
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
The day before that,

312
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
It took until 4 o'clock in the evening.

313
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
It's 5 o'clock when I got home.

314
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I had to go to Kyoto on the 7.50 Shinkansen.

315
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
I couldn't sleep.

316
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I left home about 6 o'clock.

317
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I was on the Shinkansen.

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I arrived at 7.20.

319
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I was on the Shinkansen for 30 minutes.

320
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
I was sitting on the Shinkansen.

321
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
I was sleepy.

322
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I was watching sports news.

323
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Time passed.

324
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I couldn't sleep.

325
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I was on the Shinkansen at 7.56.

326
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I was on the Shinkansen for 50 minutes.

327
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Hamada, let's get off!

328
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Why?

329
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Mr. Matsumoto told me to bring you back.

330
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
What are you talking about?

331
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I have to protect my body.

332
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
You're annoying!

333
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
I really need it.

334
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I got home at 5 o'clock.

335
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
It took only 2 hours.

336
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I took a bath.

337
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I thought I shouldn't sleep.

338
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
But I'm tired.

339
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm exhausted.

340
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I have a companion girl.

341
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
You're just an old man.

342
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I was taking a nap.

343
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I was taking a nap, too.

344
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes, yes.

345
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
I didn't see you.

346
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
And then...

347
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
At 7 o'clock, it's Sunday.

348
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
It's Sunday.

349
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
I'm going to pick you up on Sunday.

350
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Do you call it Sunday?

351
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Where are you looking?

352
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm a dance manager.

353
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Ping-pong, ping-pong, ping-pong.

354
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,440
At first, I heard ping-pong.

355
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,440
So I thought it was Ping-pong.

356
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Everyone was there, but I didn't fool them.

357
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
I thought it was Ping-pong at first.

358
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,440
But I knew it was Sunday.

359
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm not Ping-pong.

360
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
That's right.

361
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm not Ping-pong.

362
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
So I thought it was wrong.

363
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
You knew it.

364
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I knew it right away.

365
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
You knew it was Sunday.

366
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I knew it was Sunday right away.

367
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
It's Sunday.

368
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm going to work.

369
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I say what I think and what I think back.

370
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Before the time...

371
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
I really like you, but I hate you.

372
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
I said it in a strong way.

373
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Women's hearts and autumn sky.

374
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
It's similar to the weather in the mountains.

375
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
I don't know why.

376
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
That's enough.

377
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm tired.

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
I got it.

379
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,440
I wanted to do it once.

380
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
You can't do it.

381
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I can't do it.

382
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I said.

383
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Let's go without saying that.

384
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Nitta said.

385
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I can't help it.

386
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I said.

387
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,440
It's like a good taste of a stubborn stall.

388
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Everyone is laughing, but I'm laughing.

389
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
There's such a thing.

390
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I wanted to show you something stubborn.

391
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
I can't do it.

392
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Then Nitta said.

393
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I got it.

394
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Akagi.

395
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Yes.

396
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Oh, come on.

397
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Today, too.

398
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Pia's.

399
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Bull's eye.

400
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Bull's eye.

401
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Pia's Bull's eye.

402
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Teresa's Bull's eye.

403
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Akagi's.

404
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
I'll give you this for now.

405
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Have you ever seen this program?

406
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm sorry.

407
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I have.

408
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,440
I don't use it.

409
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
You've got a job.

410
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Have you ever thought about quitting today?

411
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
I have.

412
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Hey, look.

413
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,440
What are you doing?

414
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Wait.

415
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
That's what happens to humans.

416
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
You can't do that.

417
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Idiot.

418
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Thank you very much.

419
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Really.

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Please take a look.

421
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Kumi Ozone from Yokohama City.

422
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
He's 20 years old.

423
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Mr. Hamada is going to play golf.

424
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
How good are you?

425
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,440
I run a golf course.

426
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Yes.

427
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Please come next time.

428
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,440
And the winner of the Chikichiki Golf Tournament will compete with me.

429
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Thank you very much.

430
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I'm not good enough to compete with you.

431
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
But you look like you're having fun.

432
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Are you really going to let me win?

433
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
I'm sure you'll let me win.

434
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Are you going to let me win for free?

435
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes.

436
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Then I'll play golf.

437
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
You look like you're having fun.

438
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
I'll play golf.

439
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Yes.

440
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
The one who wins.

441
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Yes.

442
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
The one who loses.

443
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Yes.

444
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
And a little...

445
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Are you allowed to say that?

446
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
I'm not that good at it.

447
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
I'm not good at it.

448
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
You've never done anything, have you?

449
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
No, I haven't.

450
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
I'll never win.

451
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm sure of it.

452
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
I'll never win.

453
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,440
How good is your par four?

454
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,440
It's still a par, so I'll have to put it in four.

455
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
I'll put it in four.

456
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Four.

457
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Thanks.

458
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Therefore, it's not six or seven.

459
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
What?

460
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Where you want to put it, six or seven?

461
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
You're a pro at it.

462
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
No, I'm not.

463
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Really.

464
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm a professional. Don't make fun of me.

465
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Let's have a golf match.

466
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Let's think about it.

467
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Let's think about it.

468
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
What if I lose?

469
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Yes, yes, yes.

470
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
It's a punishment game.

471
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Yes, yes, yes.

472
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Let's think of something better than skydiving.

473
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
There are times when you're the one who's in the back.

474
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Are you stupid?

475
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,440
You can think of something like that.

476
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
You can't do that right away.

477
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,440
You should do it while you're practicing.

478
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
What?

479
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
That's right.

480
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm good at playing on the field.

481
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Have you ever been on a golf course?

482
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Let's play golf.

483
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Let's think about it.

484
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Every time my mother appears on TV, she says,

485
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Oh, Yakuza.

486
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,440
I'm watching it, but I'm going to turn it off.

487
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, that's about it.

488
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Do you have a Yakuza?

489
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,440
It's about you.

490
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
It's definitely different.

491
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
It's definitely different.

492
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,440
You don't look like a Yakuza.

493
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
How much do you...

494
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
You don't look like a Yakuza.

495
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
You're imitating me from a great distance.

496
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Am I stupid?

497
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,440
How much am I?

498
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,440
You're amazing.

499
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,440
There's a dog following me.

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
There's a pigeon flying around here.

501
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,440
There's a deer laughing.

502
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Where are you walking?

503
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
There's a deer following me.

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Where are you walking?

505
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
You're walking, but you're stupid.

506
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm trying to get close to you.

507
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
There's a deer laughing.

508
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I don't know.

509
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Are you going to get up?

510
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,440
If I were to go through that dead flower...

511
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,440
People who've been sick for a long time...

512
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,440
It's going to be a good feeling.

513
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
That's you.

514
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,440
The other day...

515
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,440
There's nothing wrong with his standing.

516
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,440
When I went to Hong Kong before...

517
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
I went to Hong Kong.

518
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
I didn't know what to do when I went to Hong Kong.

519
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
After I got there, I went to the tax office.

520
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
The people over there are a little slow.

521
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
One by one.

522
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,440
If you don't check it carefully, you don't know what you're holding.

523
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Everyone knows that.

524
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Even if you get a certificate, it's already overseas.

525
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Everyone thinks of it as a Tsukimon.

526
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
They're lined up like this.

527
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
It was a little late.

528
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
I went to Hong Kong.

529
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I didn't understand Japanese at all.

530
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
I caught a girl.

531
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,440
What's wrong with you guys?

532
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Hong Kong people are...

533
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
What do you call it?

534
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,440
They're all over the place.

535
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
It's you, isn't it?

536
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:53,440
They're all over the place.

537
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
How many times have you been to Hong Kong?

538
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I've been to Hong Kong many times.

539
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,440
You don't like Hong Kong people, do you?

540
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Come on, come on.

541
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Don't be so comical.

542
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
You've been like this all the time.

543
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,440
What's wrong with that?

544
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,440
But I don't understand English.

545
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,440
You know what?

546
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I understand.

547
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
You understand?

548
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I understand.

549
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Why don't you understand Japanese?

550
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
I don't understand.

551
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,440
What I want to focus on is this.

552
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,440
That's why I don't understand what you're saying.

553
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
I understand this.

554
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Why do you understand Japanese?

555
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
This is...

556
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
This is...

557
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,440
It's kind of like a baby's cry.

558
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,440
It's kind of like a baby's cry.

559
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
It's common in all countries.

560
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't think it's carbonated water because you said it.

561
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm back.

562
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Who are you talking to?

563
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
That's about it.

564
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,440
What?

565
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,440
That's...

566
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,440
You're not even acting.

567
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,440
You can do the one with Mr. Nika.

568
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,440
I'll do it.

569
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,440
That was a good one.

570
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm looking for a copy of the agreement.

571
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Please bring it to me.

572
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Thank you for coming today.

573
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Please bring it to me.

574
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,440
This reminds me of the Shimin Pool.

575
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
That's about it.

576
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,440
Mr. Kuroki came to the opening today.

577
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,440
That was amazing.

578
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
He was in a good mood.

579
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
It was a little intense.

580
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,440
I couldn't say anything because I didn't watch the video.

581
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,440
And Mr. Kuroki.

582
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Next time...

583
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,440
We're all here together.

584
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:44,440
I'm going to show you what we did together.

585
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Did I say that?

586
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
You did.

587
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Are you kidding me?

588
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,440
I'm going to show you what we did together next time.

589
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
That's about it.

590
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm going to do it next time.

591
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Bye.

592
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Ouch!

593
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm going to show you what we did together next time.

594
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm going to show you what we did together next time.

595
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,440
I'm going to show you what we did together next time.

596
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:44,440
