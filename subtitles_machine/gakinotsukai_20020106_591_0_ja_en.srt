1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today, we have a special project for the New Year.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We will give you the best of the 2001 Gaki no Tsukai Omoshiro VTR.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This year, I have been selected as a member of the board of directors for four consecutive years.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I am the former downtown manager and the current producer of Lumineza Yoshimoto.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Fujiwara Hiroshi.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Congratulations!

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Why do you keep saying that this is the best of the 2002 Gaki no Tsukai Omoshiro VTR?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Who is the best of the 2002 Gaki no Tsukai Omoshiro VTR?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It is not the best of the 2002 Gaki no Tsukai Omoshiro VTR.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, we have come to the end of the 2002 Gaki no Tsukai Omoshiro VTR.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How was last year?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was a good year.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We had a drama called Ashi-ta ga Arisa.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It was a good year.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It was really good.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We had a record time before that.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We had a record time with this member.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There was a special in the drama.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There was a special in the drama.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please watch it.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Please watch it.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was a good year.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was a good year.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It was a good year.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was a good year.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This program is sponsored by the following sponsors.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's start.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will announce the best of the year in 2001.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
First, we will announce the top 10 to the 7th place.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The winner is VTR Ruby.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The library is a place where you have to be quiet.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The person who pulls the skull card will be punished.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The person who pulls the skull card will be punished.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What will you drink?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What!

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a book rod.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a good year.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a book rod.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He makes such a joke and buys any book rod.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Once again, he appeared in the recording of a kid.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want to say hello to you.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is that?

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That is...

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In the TV station in Africa,

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
there was a girl who said she wanted to be close to me.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In the TV station in Africa?

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey!

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you doing?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Look down there.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What is that?

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is a time bomb!

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Time is running out!

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The staff must have set it up.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
As a single person...

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't want to lose!

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
As a single person...

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't want to lose!

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What?

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
As a single person...

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't want to lose!

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How many times have you said that?

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As a single person...

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't want to lose!

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are making a mistake.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You are making a mistake.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
As a single person...

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't want to lose!

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You are making a mistake.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hey!

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Kazumi, where are you?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey!

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What are you doing?

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey!

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Stop!

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey!

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why did you do that?

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Kazumi!

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, no, no.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no, no.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not Kazumi.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In addition, Itao started a death match with his wife against Yamazaki vs. Morima.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Itao!

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And he even introduced this person.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is this?

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What is this?

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, I think I've been on American TV before this program.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The musical instrument is very popular here.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The president who made the goods is very popular.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you make it yourself?

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I want to say something.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, no, no.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, no, no.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No, no, no.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No, no, no.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I wrote it.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's take a look.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's just a sticker.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's amazing.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't catch up with it.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why?

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It doesn't matter.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I made a mistake.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I made a mistake.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I made a mistake.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
By the way, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a combination of the two of us.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's not a combination.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a combination of the two of us.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a combination of the two of us.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm making a lot of money.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not a combination.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're good at manzai.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're good at manzai.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're good at manzai.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're good at manzai.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What?

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're good at manzai.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The biggest event of the year, the entertainer fishing competition.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This time, a hot battle with gorgeous faces has been held.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I feel good.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a smart manzai.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I told you, didn't I?

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's just me.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who will be the winner of the 7th round?

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The winner is...

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Matsumoto Matsumoto!

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I did it!

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I did it!

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Matsumoto Matsumoto!

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Endo's delusion began when a new cute AD came into the program.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Endo's attitude is quite different.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't aim at me.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There is no such thing as a tape.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Endo.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Endo.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Endo.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I was surprised.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Endo's delusion didn't stop even when he went out to the badminton tournament.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How was the referee?

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How was the referee?

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How was the referee?

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Referee.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Referee.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Were you in?

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I was in because it was raining.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I wasn't in.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you talking about?

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Matsumoto Matsumoto!

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Endo.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Endo.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Endo.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Endo.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Endo.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Endo.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Endo.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Endo.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Endo.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Endo.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Endo.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Endo.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Endo.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Endo.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Endo!

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You are making me angry.

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Endo.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Endo.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Endo.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Endo.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Endo.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Endo.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Endo.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Endo.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Endo.

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Endo.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Endo.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Endo.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Leave.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Endo.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Endo.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Endo.

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Endo.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Endo.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Endo.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Endo.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Endo.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Endo.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Endo.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Endo.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The director hasn't changed, has he?

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, I'm not. You're leaving it to me, right?

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's strange that Seita is above the director.

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's strange, right?

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why don't you believe me?

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm doing it this way.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you filming?

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Nothing at all.

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I said it earlier.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Man, you're good.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I didn't do it.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why are you wearing it?

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In celebration of Hamada's 38th birthday, those two came.

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hurry up and give it to me.

212
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why are you so cool?

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hamada-san, I heard that today is your birthday.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I brought you a present.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No, I don't want it.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Please accept it.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Please accept it.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hamada-san, I don't want it.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's my birthday after the show.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't want it.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Shut up.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Shut up.

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Shut up.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't touch it.

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Stop it.

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Stop it.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Stop it.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Stop it.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oshima wanted to date Hamada no matter what.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So he decided to become Hamada's type by Matsumoto's advice.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He said it many times.

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I like a woman who doesn't get hurt even if I put her stomach in her nose.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I like strong women.

234
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Really?

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But you don't have a strong woman.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't have a strong woman.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What's wrong?

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oshima, I have a strong woman.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What?

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have a strong woman.

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can do it.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You have a strong woman.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You have a strong woman.

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have a strong woman.

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
She will definitely turn around.

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can do it.

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Go, go, go.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I will go.

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hamada-san.

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Please look at me.

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What's wrong?

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She is crying.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She is crying.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She is crying.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Are you stupid?

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Go away.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Go away.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It was close.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was close.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It wasn't close.

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I have to go to the drama location.

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I will go home.

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Thank you.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's not good.

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you.

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's go.

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I did it.

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Please.

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Please.

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oshima came to the location of the drama.

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hamada was surprised by the action of Oshima.

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Please.

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Please.

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Please.

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Please.

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Please.

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you wearing?

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I like you.

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It hurts.

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Robocon.

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Help me.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Help me.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Help me.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Robocon.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Robocon.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You.

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You.

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The next day.

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
On this day, 18 Hamashos were divided into enemies and allies.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They fought in baseball.

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The fourth is the second Hamashos.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The fifth is the sixth Hamashos.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The sixth is the seventh Hamashos.

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The eighth is the eighth Hamashos.

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

305
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The ninth is the eighth Hamashos.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I know that face.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's the worst.

310
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I think he was surprised once.

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He stood up but didn't know what to do, so he did this again.

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It was interesting.

313
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hamada's attack was amazing.

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But he gave up, didn't he?

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes.

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was beaten by my father and Aikazawa was beaten by my father.

317
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was beaten by my father and Aikazawa was beaten by my father.

318
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's the fifth Hamashos.

319
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's the fifth Hamashos.

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Is it me?

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not me.

322
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's the sixth Hamashos.

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's the sixth Hamashos.

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's the sixth Hamashos.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's not me.

326
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hamada-san.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hamada-san.

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is blue, isn't it?

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is blue, isn't it?

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is blue, isn't it?

331
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So when the red comes out here, cut it quickly.

333
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There's no such thing.

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He tried a lot, but it didn't work out.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The limited time is 6 hours.

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And finally, he will challenge the last one.

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Got it!

338
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It works!

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It doesn't work.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It doesn't work.

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It doesn't work.

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It farts.

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It farts.

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ahh...

345
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ahh...

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Ahh...

347
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I did it!

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I did it!

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I did it!

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I did it!

351
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I did it!

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I did it!

353
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Amazing!

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Seriously amazing!

355
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
2nd place

356
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
2nd place is the one who made Japan laugh

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I did it!

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I did it!

359
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I see

360
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's a punishment game

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's a serious punishment game

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It went too well

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We didn't know what to do

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's the 36th time

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's true

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
56 hours

367
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's a punishment game

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I think it's 1st place

369
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think it's 1st place

370
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
1st place?

371
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
1st place?

372
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm getting married

373
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This is the first time Yamazaki has announced that he's getting married

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yamazaki

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And Yamazaki went to say goodbye to the women he said was his girlfriend

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I love you

377
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Forget about me

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It hurts

379
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It hurts

380
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It hurts but you're really noisy

381
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It hurts

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to jump

383
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It hurts

384
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And he said goodbye to Moriman

385
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And it's the last game

386
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I got in my pants

387
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's in my mouth

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yamazaki

389
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He's a foreigner

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But the situation was unexpected

391
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yamazaki

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't want to play a game like this

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's like Mori no Ijima

394
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yamazaki

395
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Mori no Ijima

396
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is real

397
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is real

398
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You look really happy

399
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I didn't do it

400
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I didn't open my eyes

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm happy

402
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're an idiot

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yamazaki finally went to the wedding

404
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
When he saw the video, he said he couldn't help but cry

405
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But when he saw the video, he was shocked

406
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He's the one who likes it

407
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He's the one who likes it

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a lie

409
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's a lie

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Where did you get this?

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's a lie

412
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's a lie

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Last year, we worked really hard

414
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And this is the first place

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What?

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We can't laugh

417
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's a terrible story

418
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Everyone, I hope for the best for Gaki no Tsukai and Luminator Yoshimoto

419
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I want to say goodbye

420
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Finally, Mr. Yamada will close the show

421
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
How was it?

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Thank you for watching
