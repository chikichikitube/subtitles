1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm standing in front of the signboard of the one-way street.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I've just heard that Hamada-san is in that hotel.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm very nervous right now.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'd like to hear the truth about Natsumi Okawa.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There he is! Hamada-san! Hamada-san!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hamada-san!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let me ask you something!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is it?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it true that Natsumi Okawa is good at playing the flute?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's none of your business!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is it?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What song is it?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let me ask you something!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is it true that Natsumi Okawa's nipples are black?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's none of your business!

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Did you hit me? Did you hit me?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hamada-san! Let me ask you something!

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is it? What song is it?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What is it?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What program is it?

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is it?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What program is it?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What right do you have to say such a thing?

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's Ruk Ruk Konnichiwa!

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Move!

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ruk Ruk is over!

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let me ask you something!

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ruk Ruk is over!

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is it true that you broke your front teeth and made Sonoda-san pay for it?

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's none of your business!

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is it, Sonoda?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't move your eyes!

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You idiot!

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What are you doing?

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hamada-san!

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it true that Natsumi Okawa's nipples are black?

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They're not black!

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hamada-san!

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't move your eyes!

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hamada-san!

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you really have to say such a thing?

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
As you heard, Hamada-san acknowledged everything.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm glad.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Good evening.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good evening.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Actually, I was supposed to do a skit here today.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I had a lot of things to do.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I changed the subject.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why do you have to do skits?

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've already given up on the name Dandan.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Really?

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's Nikonsha Kikonsha.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I thought I'd give it a try.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's your time from now on.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know what?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've already figured out how to deal with people.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Really?

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just now, I had a letter on my desk.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I opened it.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It said, congratulations.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's not good.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, from now on, do your best at work in Tokyo.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well!

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well!

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It doesn't matter how you read it.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even Mutsuru's letter says, well!

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well!

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well!

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well!

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
To be honest, this program is a little messy, isn't it?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Actually, we're already shooting on Tuesdays.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's supposed to be a long one.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But we'll have to postpone it to next year.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't have to do that.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just let it go.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Today's part will be released next week.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Today's part will be released next Tuesday.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's like I was chased by a reporter during the opening.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't go that far.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a waste.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But it's warmer than you think, isn't it?

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's my first time today.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I had a hard time, too.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm a partner, so I knew it.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The fact that the ceremony was held in October.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But this is a top secret from the company.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't tell anyone.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The staff here knew about it, too.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The staff here knew about Yuya Nittere's news.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know if Yuya got a little bit of it.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know if it was a joke, but they kept it a secret.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I kept it a secret from my close friends, too.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nevertheless, your couple is a little weird.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What?

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
In Osaka dialect, the weak ones here are called Itai.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Your couple is Itai.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't want to hide it.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm trying my best not to tell anyone.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's pretty proud.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sitting side by side with the Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We're not on the same train.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There are a lot of fans in Osaka.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I ran to them and said,

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hamada-san, what are you doing?

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sitting side by side with Natsumi Ogawa and the Shinkansen.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We're wearing the same clothes.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's why it's Itai.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's Itai.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's not true.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's not true, but I don't cry.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's just a matter of time before they find out.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But like you said,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I didn't really try to hide it.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You didn't try to hide it.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're wearing the same clothes.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're wearing the same clothes.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What kind of clothes are we wearing?

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We're wearing the same leather jacket.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're sitting side by side.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What is this?

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's hot.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's not true.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you do that, they'll find you.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't know why they found me.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why did they find you?

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's because your father is Itai.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone in my family is Itai.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Your father doesn't like to hide things.

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But if they find out, they'll think it's not true.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He must have come from somewhere else.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What?

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He must have said something.

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My father is a painter.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's bragging about how he painted the Soviet Union.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you know about the Soviet Union?

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's red and white.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's red and white.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You painted that, didn't you?

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's just two colors.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Anyone can do it.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're a big idiot.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I painted it from top to bottom.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You could have painted it beautifully.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I gathered my colleagues at work.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When I told them not to talk about marriage,

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I gathered my colleagues at work.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I said, I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow.

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
My colleagues at work asked me why.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I said, I'm going to marry my son.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's a different story.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It was a lie.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I thought it was bad.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
From October until now,

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I thought it was a pity.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I thought I didn't know anything.

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Everyone knows you're not a virgin.

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is amazing.

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
At this point?

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
At this point.

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not true.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's true, but it's not true at all.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know.

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's a lie.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a lie.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a lie.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a lie.

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a lie.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a lie.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a lie.

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a lie.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a lie.

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't think I'm 100% wrong.

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't say anything.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think you're wrong.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm wearing a bra.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why?

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's wrong?

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How many girls do you have?

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a pity.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What's wrong?

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're 26 years old.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What?

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There's a lot of things.

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What?

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There's a lot of things.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not that I'm in a hurry.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's a lot of things.

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, that's right.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not that I'm in a hurry.

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why is it not that I'm in a hurry?

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What?

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why is it not that I'm in a hurry?

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What?

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why is it not that I'm in a hurry?

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Isn't it?

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't care about your story.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I heard it.

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I knew you were married, but I didn't expect you to be called P-chan at home.

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I felt sorry for you.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
My back was broken.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you mean P-chan?

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't expect you to be called that.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I didn't expect that.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You don't have to say that.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I didn't expect that.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But I heard a lot of things about you.

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I heard that you were called as a single.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
When I was with my girlfriend?

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Everyone called me Matsumoto-kun.

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My girlfriend is very strict.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Like Matsumoto-kun.

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Matsumoto-shi.

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's written in the book.

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's not Matsumoto-shi.

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But you didn't say anything.

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What?

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You wanted to talk about it.

229
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
About what?

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm really strict.

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm more strict than Golgo 13.

232
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't talk at all.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But you two are very soft.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's enough.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought it was amazing that you didn't come out of your house.

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I thought you would go somewhere.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I thought the world was cold.

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was on the radio in Osaka yesterday.

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It was late at night.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There were a lot of fans in the cold mountains.

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
At the gate.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I was wondering how many people would come to my party.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I got in the car.

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There were only two people.

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There were less people than usual.

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There were less people.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We are completely separated now.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Did you see it?

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I talked about it the night before.

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
At 10 a.m. on the next day.

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was working at Yoshimoto Kaikan.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was the only one there.

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I got off the taxi with my manager.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A reporter came to me.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I said congratulations.

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A girl was in the outside car.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Liar!

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Screaming.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Liar!

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was talking.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Liar!

262
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was amazing.

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was watching.

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't think you can cheat.

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't think so.

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I see.

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't like girls when you are married?

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't think so.

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What do you think?

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It doesn't matter.

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Liar!

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I will get angry again.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
In a sense.

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For a fan.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When you are married, you are calm.

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you mean?

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are calm.

279
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There is a monitor.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can watch with peace of mind.

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you are not married, you are not calm.

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You can say that.

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You are not calm.

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I am not calm at all.

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Liar!

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Liar!

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Liar!

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's good.

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Liar!

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have been writing fan letters.

292
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

293
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't blame me.

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't blame you.

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I won't do it for 10 years.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The girl I like is in elementary school.

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How do you know that?

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What kind of school do you want to go to?

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't know.

300
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I want you to be happy.

301
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let me introduce the letters.

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Please bring it.

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is the assistant girl.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I feel good today.

305
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She applied for this program.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How old are you?

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
22 years old.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You are cute.

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You are an amateur, right?

310
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You haven't done this before, right?

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is the first time.

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You are brave.

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who was your ex-girlfriend?

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She was my ex-girlfriend until the day before yesterday.

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know what you are talking about.

316
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll tell you later.

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Thank you.

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Later?

319
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You are brave.

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You are a model.

321
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let me introduce the letters.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What are you doing on your day off?

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is a simple question.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How is your day off?

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What is that?

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What is your day off?

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Leave me alone.

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I have a letter.

329
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I have been sleeping until the evening.

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
With whom?

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Who is sleeping with me?

332
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sleeping alone until the evening.

333
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Are you sleeping alone?

334
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Aren't you sleeping together?

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

336
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't have a girlfriend like that.

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What?

338
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You are sleeping alone, aren't you?

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

340
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are you sleeping apart?

341
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Your wife is 18 years old.

342
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't understand.

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why are you sleeping apart?

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It depends on the situation.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It depends on the situation.

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Shut up.

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's move on.

348
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This person is from Yokohama.

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
His pen name is Frillman.

350
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Frillman is a fun program.

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why did it end?

352
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know.

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This program is good.

354
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is a story I saw on the 5th of December.

355
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I thought.

356
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The reason why fans come to Matsumoto's house.

357
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Matsumoto is a good person.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Even if he is angry, he is not powerful.

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If he is angry, he will be beaten up.

360
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He knows his girlfriend is there.

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So he can't enter the house.

362
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Did you know that?

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why?

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Because Matsumoto is a good person?

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No.

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why?

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But I will be bullied in the future.

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You have been bullied, haven't you?

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I haven't told you yet.

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If I tell you, you will be angry.

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You will say, I want to do it too.

372
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I couldn't tell you.

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I haven't told you in Osaka.

374
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I hated Matsumoto the most.

375
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I was tired and went home.

376
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I didn't sleep well for two days.

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I thought I would sleep at home today.

378
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I was sleeping alone.

379
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
At about 2 o'clock in the morning.

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There was a fire somewhere.

381
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was getting closer.

382
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I went to the 10th floor of the apartment.

383
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was very noisy.

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I thought it was a big fire.

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I opened the door and looked down.

386
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There was a fire truck lined up.

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In your apartment?

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes.

389
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was wondering if it was upstairs or downstairs.

390
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I thought it was in this apartment.

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The fire truck came up.

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Firefighters came.

393
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Matsumoto.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a fire, isn't it?

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I said, I'm coming.

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There was a report.

397
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The fire truck came in.

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The fire truck came to the window of my house.

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I couldn't do that.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I couldn't do that.

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't know what I should do.

402
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I thought the fireman should come home.

403
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I called him.

404
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes.

405
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He said, if you get in through the window, you'll be surprised.

406
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
He said, if you get in through the window, you'll be surprised.

407
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I said that's wrong.

408
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then he said, the fireman wouldn't come out.

409
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I said.

410
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right.

411
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Even though it's meaningless.

412
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I didn't mean to come out.

413
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It just came out.

414
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was shocked when I heard that.

415
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I couldn't sleep for a while.

416
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you want to go to Osaka-ben?

417
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Osaka-ben?

418
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's right.

419
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm wearing a postcard like this.

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know if it's going to decrease from now on.

421
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because there is such a thing.

422
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's increasing for you.

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What are you talking about?

424
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're definitely right.

425
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Even if I get married, I'll still be popular.

426
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You should think so.

427
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I got it now.

428
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can't do it.

429
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
My staff said,

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, you can't do it anymore.

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If it's a staff,

432
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll say, no, it's not like that.

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
There are fans of Hamada.

434
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm going to give you a gift.

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm going to give you a gift.

436
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm going to give you a gift.

437
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sweating.

438
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
My friends told me to talk.

439
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
My friends told me to talk.

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I went to the internet to talk.

441
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I went to the internet to talk.

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know.

443
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I was wondering if you were curious.

444
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Nan-chan

445
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

446
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I feel like I'm sleeping.

447
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You talk clearly.

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're really sitting down.

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

451
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Nan-chan,

452
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You should practice your pronunciation.

453
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I've known Nan-chan for a long time.

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I've talked a lot.

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Do you know what I'm saying?

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't say it with your face.

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know what you're saying.

458
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm not good at it.

459
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Sometimes I think,

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm not good at it.

461
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But I'm not good at it.

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You're aiming.

463
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm going to Osaka-ben.

464
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm going to Osaka-ben for the last time today.

465
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm going to Osaka-ben for the last time today.

466
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know what to think.

467
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Today, we have a lot of things that are thick.

468
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
For example, there are thin things, right?

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thin.

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thin things are thin here and in Osaka, right?

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What is really thin?

472
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thick and thin.

473
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We call it thick and thin, right?

474
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I think everyone knows by now.

475
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Even thinner than that!

476
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What do you call it?

477
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What do you call thick and thin in Tokyo?

478
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Super thin.

479
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Super thin?

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Super thin?

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What do you call it?

482
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Super thin!

483
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Super thin!

484
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Super thin!

485
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is super thin!

486
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We call it super!

487
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Super!

488
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We call it super in Osaka.

489
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The health teacher calls it super.

490
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Super thin.

491
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Super thin.

492
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And on top of that you call it super thin.

493
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What do you call it more thin?

494
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What do you call it?

495
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Super!

496
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We call it super thin!

497
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Ah, is that so?

498
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So thin, super thin.

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And then we have super thick!

500
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We call it super thick.

501
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Super thick!

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Super thick and thin!

503
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't know much about this, but I'd like you to remember this word, monogotsui, today.

504
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's right, monogotsui.

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's all for today.

506
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay.

507
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
How should I answer this?

508
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
How should I answer this?

509
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right. How should we answer this?

510
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If we ask, what is thin?

511
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's thin.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why?

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's very thin.

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's very thin.

517
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

519
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

520
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, then.

521
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What is thin?

522
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

523
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What?

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think there are a lot of Hamada fans here today.

525
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why?

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What is thin?

527
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's thin.

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Say it properly.

529
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What is very thin?

530
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

531
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Say it properly.

532
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What is very thin?

533
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's gotsui hosoi.

534
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Say it properly.

535
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you very much.

536
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's see you next time.

537
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Let's see you next time.

538
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

539
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's been a long time.

540
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But I don't know what to do.

541
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is...

542
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is...

543
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
When I say it once, it's like this.

544
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's okay, right?

545
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's right.

546
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think we'll break up by the end of next year.

547
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But both of them are stupid.

548
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But there might be someone who thinks so.

549
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I think so.

550
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, you don't think so?

551
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
How much do you think so?

552
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That's right.

553
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Next year, I want to do as much as I can.

554
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's right.

555
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
As I said, next year is the first day of the new year.

556
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
