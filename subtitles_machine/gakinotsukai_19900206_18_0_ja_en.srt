1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for your hard work.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you for your hard work.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, we are in downtown Gakinosukai.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, I'm Genno.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is the studio of Nittere.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We just finished the show.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, we are in downtown Gakinosukai.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't zoom in on me.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is our manager, Mitake.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is our manager, Mitake.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Today, as promised, we are going to do the SM.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's go to the venue.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I had a picture in my head.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's 10 times bigger than I thought.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm like the last warrior of the Famicom.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If I defeat him, I'll be free.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now, we are on Japanese TV.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is Kanda Pansen.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let me introduce him again.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He is the monster of Nitta.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He is the monster of Nitta.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Good morning.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good morning.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That was close.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I laughed when I first saw him.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Did you take the bullet train on Sunday?

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, I did.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't be so serious.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Nitta will be free today.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll see you later.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Please look forward to it.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you ready?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm Hamada, the mayor of Kojima.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Leave it to me.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your son will be saved.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This kidnapping case is not a big deal.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Really?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've done it many times.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's easy.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Listen to me.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You'll be fine.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll tell you one thing.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll tell you one thing.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll tell you one thing.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Even if the criminal calls me,

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
don't tell the police that I'm here.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay?

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If the criminal calls me and finds out that I'm here,

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
don't tell the police that I'm here.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Listen to me.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When the criminal calls you,

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
take as much time as you can.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just do it.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't do unnecessary things.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Take as much time as you can.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ma'am.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't do it.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm nervous.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You have to take it right away.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's over.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's over.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't do it.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Listen to me.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you understand?

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When the criminal calls you,

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
take as much time as you can.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's enough.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why are you speaking in such a low voice?

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's okay.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is...

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is it?

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I have to record his voice.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hello?

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is my son okay?

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How much do I have to pay?

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sure you didn't do anything.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's good.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Very good.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's ask him.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hello?

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hello.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is Nikonikonkaku Shujuku.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is my son okay?

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He's doing well.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
By the way,

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
your salary has been accumulated for about two months.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How much do I have to pay?

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's 64,000 yen in two months.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You didn't do anything to my son, did you?

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's okay.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is not Sparta Shujuku.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Thank you.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Madam.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't do it.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll beat you.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't do it.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Listen to me.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll kill you.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you very much.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you really think so?

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't do it.

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll kick you.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay?

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Answer me.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay?

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If the criminal calls you again,

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
don't get in trouble.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay?

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't make the criminal angry.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't make him angry.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is the rule.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay?

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you understand?

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you okay?

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll call you.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't make him angry.

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't make him angry.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hello.

166
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hello.

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The criminal.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is my son okay?

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Your son?

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That dirty dog?

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Is he okay?

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He's not okay.

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's about time.

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Did you hear?

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The criminal.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

179
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The criminal.

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Calm down.

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't make him angry.

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're a criminal.

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're a criminal with a black face.

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're a fool.

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

186
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm a criminal.

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My son.

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
My son.

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What are you talking about?

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're a criminal.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're a criminal with a face like a fool.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What kind of face is that?

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're a criminal.

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Did you call me a criminal?

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're a criminal.

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're a criminal with a face like a fool.

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What kind of face is that?

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who did you call a criminal?

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The criminal who looks like a fool.

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What kind of face is that?

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're angry.

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't make him angry.

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
With a face like a fool.

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

207
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Pooh.

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Pooh.

209
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A little more.

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're definitely looking down on me.

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What are you talking about?

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You.

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you have to say that to me?

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you mean?

215
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you say that to me, I'll kill you.

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll kill you.

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You'll kill a kid? Do it yourself, idiot!

218
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're weird, you're weird, hey!

219
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't be such a crybaby, you idiot!

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Idiot, idiot!

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Antenna.

222
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Antenna.

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The other day, when I was on my way to Tokyo Station, I slipped.

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In a taxi?

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, in a taxi.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
About 10 meters.

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I slipped like crazy.

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I thought I was going to die.

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You wouldn't die if you slipped.

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That was really dangerous.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I've been there before.

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I see.

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When I was freezing.

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was with a friend of mine who was freezing.

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
On a day like this, there are probably a lot of idiots who are freezing.

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
About three minutes later, I was already used to it.

237
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was like, it's dangerous!

238
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then, I was like,

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And then, I was like,

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then, I was like,

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And then, I was like,

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And then, I was like,

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The first time I saw it, it was the scariest.

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The driver was wearing a red sweater.

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The girl in the passenger seat was wearing a white sweater.

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And then, it spins.

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then, it spins.

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It looked like a pink sweater.

249
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I thought it was scary.

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It was spinning so much.

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The driver was a man.

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The girl in the passenger seat looked like a pink okama.

253
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Idiot!

254
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't think anyone believes it.

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was really scary.

256
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm scared of cars.

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've experienced a lot of things with cars.

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Me too.

259
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I had a standing wave test.

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You go to a training center and you learn about the standing wave test.

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If the air pressure is low, the tires will burst.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I was the first one to get a test.

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was the first one to get a test.

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I got a test for 10,000 yen.

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Idiot!

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You should buy anything.

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I got a test for 10,000 yen.

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Starlet.

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's amazing.

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I wanted everyone to ride that car.

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It was so funny.

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It was so worn out.

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Really.

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It was about 7 years ago.

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
When I got on the highway, I heard a weird sound.

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I heard a weird sound.

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're lying.

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think something was living on the roof.

279
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
When I got on the highway, I heard a weird sound.

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The wind was blowing from somewhere.

281
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was running.

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I heard the sound of a helicopter.

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought there was an accident.

284
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I thought there was an accident.

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I thought it was close.

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I was running.

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I couldn't fly a helicopter.

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was flying with a joke.

289
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I was flying like this.

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You were singing a song.

291
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was flying like this.

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was flying like this.

293
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was flying like this.

294
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was so tired.

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I stopped at the parking lot.

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I couldn't see the tire on the right.

297
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I thought I was going to be killed.

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I was in a hurry.

299
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I went into the car.

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I looked at the rear view mirror.

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was a very dangerous car.

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It was a very dangerous car.

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When the traffic light stopped, I didn't know what I was saying.

304
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
When the traffic light stopped, I didn't know what I was saying.

305
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think it was a real car.

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The only thing I could do was...

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A woman was sitting next to me.

308
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I told her to stop.

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I told her to stop.

310
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I couldn't see the rear view mirror.

311
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I told her to stop.

312
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I couldn't see the rear view mirror.

313
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I opened the door and tried to get out of the car.

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I opened the door and tried to get out of the car.

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I was looking at the rear view mirror.

316
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was looking at the rear view mirror.

317
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I tried to get out of the car and then pushed the arm to her.

318
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You didn't try to get out of the car.

319
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't do that.

320
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The woman in the front seat sat down ligth.

321
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
At that moment, you know what?

322
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I tried not to look up.

323
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I tried not to look up.

324
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I put my hand in the Baby next to.

325
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I put my hand in the Baby next to.

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I took her because it was almost a miscarriage.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I took her because it was almost a miscarriage.

328
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I thought I was still putting my hand in the baby's紗.

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's hard to get out of the bed.

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was on the train, and suddenly I went to the toilet, and I was in trouble.

331
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What happened?

332
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I was on a narrow road, and I was shaking like this.

333
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You were sweating.

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I was sweating, and I couldn't move.

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You were shaking like this.

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I was shaking like this, and sometimes I had to use the accelerator like this.

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I couldn't open it, so I had to do it like this.

338
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was driving like this, and I was shaking like this.

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The front tires were like this.

340
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Really?

341
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why were the tires like your legs?

342
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If it was dangerous on the Majinger Z, it would have been like this.

343
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The car was like this, too.

344
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But you've never been wet, right?

345
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, I've never been wet.

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
There's a saying that you can't tell what's going on because of the heat, right?

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes, there is.

348
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
My brother was crazy.

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In the past, we were sleeping together.

350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The heat was about 40 degrees.

351
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know what he was thinking.

352
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He woke up at about 3 o'clock in the evening.

353
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He woke up and said,

354
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Winner? And then he fell asleep again.

355
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What is it?

356
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What is a winner?

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It was funny, so I couldn't sleep until the morning.

358
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What is a winner?

359
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's a boring story.

360
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
With my wife.

361
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Moriguchi Hiroko's office.

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He was from Moriguchi's office, so I couldn't tell him.

363
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you went on a trip with your wife, right?

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes, I went on a trip and stayed at a hotel.

365
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I told my manager that I was going on a trip with a different person.

366
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
When I was sleeping.

367
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He suddenly woke up and said,

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hey, I'm going home.

369
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He woke up and said,

370
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hey, I'm going home.

371
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
My wife said,

372
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Where are you going home?

373
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll show you the postcard.

374
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's cute.

375
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm a salaryman.

376
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's nice.

377
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, I'd like you to wave your whip.

378
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're going to graduate from university.

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We're going to shoot a commercial.

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We're going to shoot a commercial.

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wave your whip.

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Where are you going home?

383
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In Itomori.

384
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's cute.

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you very much.

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I can see your panties.

387
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let me introduce the postcards.

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You've all seen it.

389
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In the opening of Zoom-in Asa on January 17th,

390
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Machan was dancing strangely.

391
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But it's a big laugh.

392
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It seems that Zoom-in Asa has become a comedy program.

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
From now on, there will be a lot of games.

394
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The loser will do various things.

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Please enjoy it.

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
For example, Hama-chan will go out to welcome the newlyweds.

397
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you going out?

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Are you stupid?

399
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't want to go out.

400
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I want to go out, but I can't.

401
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you really want to go out?

402
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I want to go out.

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to go out, but why?

404
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't want to go out.

405
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't help it.

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't help it.

407
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a matter of fate.

408
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't help it.

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a matter of fate.

410
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's a matter of fate.

411
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This person is...

412
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Good evening, Mr. Ochihama.

413
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I always watch your show.

414
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There are various things.

415
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When I took the questionnaire in our class,

416
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It became like a tongue.

417
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's just one of us.

418
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please don't worry.

419
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
All the best 5 are included.

420
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
First of all, if you want to be my boyfriend,

421
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
First, me.

422
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hama-chan.

423
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Second, Hiromi.

424
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Third, Mach-chan.

425
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Fourth, Chin-san.

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Fifth, U-chan.

427
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you want to be my brother,

428
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
First, Hiromi.

429
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Second, me.

430
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Third, Nan-chan.

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fourth, Chin-san.

432
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Fifth, you.

433
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you want to be my marriage partner,

434
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
First, Mach-chan.

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Did you hear the sound of bowing?

436
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's already low.

437
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Second, Hiromi.

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Third, me.

439
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Fourth, Chin-san.

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Fifth, U-chan.

441
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Your personality...

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Your personality seems to be good.

443
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I haven't told you yet.

444
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Your personality seems to be good.

445
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
First, Hiromi.

446
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What?

447
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's strange.

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
First, Hiromi.

449
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is strange.

450
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is strange.

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Second, U-chan.

452
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I know this.

453
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Third, Chin-san.

454
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I know Chin-san.

455
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Fourth, Nan-chan.

456
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I know this.

457
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Fifth, me.

458
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know.

459
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Isn't there a me in it?

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There is no better personality than me.

461
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is the most strange thing.

462
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't believe that you are in it.

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, no.

464
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If you can do this,

465
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Bring your sister here.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Tell me everything you've done so far.

467
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What did I do?

468
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You brothers are amazing.

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Godzilla vs. Biolance.

470
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I had a fight with my sister.

471
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I only had a towel.

472
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I ran to the beach with a towel.

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I got wet and got wet again.

474
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This idea is amazing.

475
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If I had only a towel, I would have stopped.

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I decided to get wet.

477
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I got wet.

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I made a decision in a few seconds.

479
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This is impossible even for Golgo.

480
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's amazing.

481
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I see.

482
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I had such a time.

483
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I like to make food like this.

484
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I like to make curry bread.

485
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I like to make Fanta.

486
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Fanta?

487
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's sweet, so it's good for hormones.

488
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I like to make hormones.

489
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I like to make a lot of sauce.

490
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I like to make a lot of sauce.

491
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You said the same thing.

492
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I like to make yogurt.

493
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
There was a boy, named Chichiasa.

494
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He said, come over here.

495
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
racers

496
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Me and my friends were having lunch.

497
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He asked.

498
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Is Chichiasa different from Chichiyasu?

499
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I said yes.

500
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Chichiasa?

501
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He threw the one that I gave him deliberately in the blackboard.

502
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It was a Chichiyasu.

503
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm Chichiyasu Yuta!

504
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's an interesting first dream, isn't it?

505
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Wait!

506
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I saw it with my own eyes!

507
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then I was like, well, well, well...

508
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You know, I have a lot of strength.

509
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If I do something like that, I think I'll get hurt.

510
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I can't use my right hand.

511
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you talking about?

512
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What are you talking about?

513
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Even though I'm weak at arm wrestling, I have a lot of strength.

514
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Wait!

515
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm weak at arm wrestling?

516
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's do it.

517
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let me tell you this.

518
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't like to simply do arm wrestling.

519
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll do something.

520
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
No, no, I'm confident.

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Liar!

522
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What are you talking about?

523
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What are you talking about?

524
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No, no, no.

525
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Can you do it?

526
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes, I can.

527
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
All right.

528
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Now you can watch the second showdown.

529
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What?

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Can you do it?

531
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What do you mean?

532
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Well, let's do it.

533
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Which one are you going to do?

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What do you mean?

535
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't show your hand at first.

536
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And then you make me think you can win.

537
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then you do it seriously next time.

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You're like a Showa Shoki.

539
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Who did it?

540
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Showa Shoki.

541
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't do such a classic thing.

542
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't do it.

543
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're like a old man.

544
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Your attitude.

545
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm a little bit of a skirt.

546
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Anyway.

547
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Come on.

548
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Like this.

549
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, it's not like that.

550
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Who says this to the whole body?

551
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Put your strength in.

552
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Come on.

553
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Put your strength in.

554
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's not like that.

555
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Come on.

556
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Put your strength in.

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The first showdown is good.

558
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The staff is excited.

559
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Where was it?

560
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yutake.

561
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What?

562
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Girls' High School.

563
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Girls' High School.

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to rip your pants.

565
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why?

566
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why do you have to rip it?

567
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm going to rip it.

568
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's like a gathering of college students.

569
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm going to rip it.

570
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If I can't rip it, I'm going to cut it.

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What are you going to do if you cut it in reverse?

572
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
If you give me a postcard, I can enter this room.

573
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can enter the room?

574
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I can enter.

575
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm going to rip it.

576
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And in the opening...

577
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was thinking about SM.

578
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I forgot.

579
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm going to rip it.

580
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He's not walking outside today, is he?

581
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He's only in the car.

582
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I wonder if he's outside.

583
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's right.

584
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He doesn't have a stroke until he goes to the dorm.

585
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's right.

586
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He's outside.

587
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll have you put in a mosaic.

588
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll have you put in a mosaic.

589
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If you're watching on TV,

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
if you want to come to my house,

591
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
please come to my house.

592
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's like a zoom-in.

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's like a punishment game.

594
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's do something like this.

595
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Please call me with this.

596
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll be waiting for you.

597
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I've already told you everything.

598
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'll be waiting for you.

599
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This program is 300.
