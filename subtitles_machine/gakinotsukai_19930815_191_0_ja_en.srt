1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next, we have Naoki Shousaku and Kageki Tatate!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Last time it was Kouyou, right?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you still Ben?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This time, Kageki-chan

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Shimoda Kageki

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And Kamata Shigeki

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Kageki Shimoda

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're wearing a lot of fashion

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Today, I'm going to talk about fashion

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I see

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Can you hit me on the forehead?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
On the forehead?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
On the forehead, right?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll grab your elbow

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll give you 30 points

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll grab your elbow

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll give you 30 points

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll go to your hip

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll go to your hip

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll go to your hip

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll go to your hip

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll go to your hip

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll go to your hip

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And...

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Put your finger in your nose

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, this

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What do I do with this?

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's raise it a little

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's right

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's make it 30-30

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's make it double-60

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What about this bang on the butt?

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's fine

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll give you 50 points

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What if I grab your tongue?

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll give you 50 points

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can you do it?

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What about a punch in the eye?

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A punch in the eye

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A punch in the eye

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
20 points

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll give you 40 points

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll give you 40 points

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll give you 40 points

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What if I break my finger?

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll give you 50 points

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What if I take off my high heels and throw them away?

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's a lot of points

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's a lot of points

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll give you 200 points

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This time, Mr. Matsumoto

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We have Mr. Kageki Shimoda, the author of Naoki

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As the kanji says, Kageki Fashion Talk

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll try to get closer to Kageki's fashion

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's have him on the stage

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Kageki Shimoda, please come on the stage

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the first time I'm wearing these

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're wearing them again today

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is the summer version

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the summer version?

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please sit down and talk

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're wearing amazing shoes again

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't have any shoes

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Isn't this a stroller?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do you normally do this?

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Of course you can do it like this

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You can do it like this, but you have to do it like this

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a little different

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I see

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I see

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You change the color every day

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is a moniker

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I wear it once every three weeks

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't have time to go

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is the fourth week

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What about the nose piercings?

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The nose piercings

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you have them open?

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, I don't

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't like to make holes

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I see

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I wear earrings

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think the nipple piercings are popular around here

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Please show me

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I was going to do it

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sometimes I don't wear contact lenses

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't have long or gold eyeglasses

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If I wear long eyeglasses, I don't wear contact lenses

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is that so?

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want to do what I like

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is this material?

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is like leather

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is what you have at home, right?

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, I don't like it

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's getting bigger

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is that so?

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Can you turn it around?

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Turn it around

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Please turn it around

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Turn it this way

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You did a good job

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But you can't tell the number of piercings, right?

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't imitate the piercings that I have

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How many kinds of shoes do you have?

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think I have 70 or 80 pairs of shoes

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is that so?

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you doing?

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to make you naked

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm not going to do that

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you're going to do that, don't do it

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not going to do that

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you healthy?

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think I'm healthy and strong

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can tell by looking down

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you always tease me?

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Only today

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I thought about it

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You two didn't tease each other

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is that so?

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm interested in you

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I like you

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's start

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll go first

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Last time I lost

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
805 points

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Even if you're slow, you can still get 805 points

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think it was more expensive to throw the shoes

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think so too

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm going to start

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is actually 1208 points

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I only have 3 pairs

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
1208?

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
1208 points

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In the second round, Mazumoto won

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm going to try to catch up

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Please show us

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I put it in the contact

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Really?

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Who will be the guest of the third round?

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Today was a good day

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It was hot

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a good day

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not a summer person

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not either

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm a person who eats yakiniku from the morning

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you think so

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's okay

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I warm the hot plate

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I put raw meat on it

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I eat it

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I eat it when I wake up

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't smoke when I wake up

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why?

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When you wake up, your nose will swell

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do you mean?

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It swells

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're doing it

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Rolling strategy

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't do it

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The fish is rolling

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's not a strategy

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've been doing it for a long time

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
After taking a bath

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
After taking a bath

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My head and body are clean

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is the only place that remains

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You do it when you take a bath

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There is dirt that cannot be removed

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you do it, it will be black

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It swells and becomes beautiful

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I feel bad when I wake up

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I feel refreshed

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm not a person who does it

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I do it like a demon

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I do it like a demon

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's a great strategy

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a great strategy

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I watch TV at home

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I watch TV at home

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't do it at home

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't do it at all

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't do it at home

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
When I forget it, it comes out

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's a bad memory

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What is it?

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know what it is

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It swells

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It swells

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There is such a thing

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know anything

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Suddenly it became hot

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Does it continue?

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I often say that it is abnormal

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When I hear that, I get angry

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's abnormal

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's only been a few decades since I observed it

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is normal

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know if it was different until now

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There are various things now

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Earthquake

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I wonder if there is something in the world

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The weather is summer now

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's raining

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's all frozen

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Suddenly

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There was nothing until now

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was living normally

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's abnormal until now

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's true now

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What are you talking about?

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I was living normally until now

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You are like Ken Shimura

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't know

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The weather until last year was abnormal

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You don't know if it's true now

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you listening to me?

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm listening

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The weather until last year was abnormal

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The weather now is normal

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There is no one

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The Shinkansen was annoying the other day

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's right

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can say that I was riding

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Shinkansen is really annoying

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I have to think about this

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The rice in the Shinkansen

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why is it so expensive?

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know the price

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's unforgivable

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can buy it at the station

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have to think about it

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can buy it

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I have to think about it

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't eat it outside

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's expensive

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I have to think about it

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I was hungry

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I saw the price

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really?

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's expensive

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why?

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you showing me a trumpet?

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a black man's father

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's enough

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you want it?

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's true

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What are you doing?

261
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's true

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's too expensive

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's expensive

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Explain it to me

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's business

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I want to make money

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's business to show movies

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not business to sell

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If you want to drink, you can bring it

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you want to go on a date, you can bring it

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a long-distance trip

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If you want to drink, you can bring it

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Young people don't want to go on a date

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Young people don't want to go on a date

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are still drinking

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to drink

277
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I want to drink

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't want to drink

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If I were a politician, I would drink

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You are frozen

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You have juice inside

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You are frozen

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't want to drink

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't hear you

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You are frozen

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I went to see a movie

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You are frozen

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's expensive, but you are frozen

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You are frozen

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You don't want to drink

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't want to say it

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a courage to say that expensive things are expensive

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Everyone can say that

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's embarrassing to say that expensive things are expensive

296
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Everyone can say that

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Everyone can't say that

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Who said that?

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Who said that?

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Who said that?

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Who said that?

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Who said that?

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Who said that?

304
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Who said that?

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
How do you count the katsura?

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's not that difficult

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's katsura

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a thing, so it's easy

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The salaryman of the katsura company

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He is selling a lot this month

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
3 miles per person

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What do you mean by miles?

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's not a promotion

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't know if he is saying it

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He is saying it

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What do you think?

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Is it an umbrella?

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's an umbrella

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's an umbrella

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's just one

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's an umbrella

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You are saying it in a strange way

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a typhoon

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How do you say it?

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's a big storm

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't say it

327
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's a hectopascal

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a hectopascal

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't say it in a strange way

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I know how you feel

333
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You are saying it in a strange way

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You are saying it in a strange way

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Like this?

336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like this?

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's a 100 hectopascal

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's a 100 hectopascal

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's a 200

340
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What if you raise it to 100?

341
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's not scary

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's scarier

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a big storm

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I know that

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What if you raise it to 100?

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What do you want me to do?

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you want me to do?

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's difficult

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's check it

350
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What is it?

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's in a cardboard

352
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't know

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't like it

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't like it

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I put it in a paper bag

356
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I put it in a paper bag

357
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I want to see the toilet

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When you buy a washing machine, it comes with this

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If it says don't use a thinner, the fridge will...

360
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The fridge will cry

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The fridge will cry

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The thinner will be removed

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There must be a box like that

364
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's hard

365
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's like a dryer

366
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There must be a box like that

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You have to put it away

368
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I've been wondering

369
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't like it

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why do you leave the top part when you sell melon?

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It must have a meaning

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why do you make it a T?

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's why you cut it like this

375
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you cut it like this, it will be a T

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It will be, but you should leave the top part

377
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Why do you cut it like this?

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Cut the top part like this

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Cut the top part like this

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Cut it like this

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, the melon is like this

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you cut it like a T, you have to cut it like this

383
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But you should cut it like this

384
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Then it will be like this

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It doesn't matter

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's easy to cut

387
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, you can't take it out

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can put it in the box like this

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then it will be like a vinyl house

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you cut it like this, you can cut it like this

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's the same as cutting like this

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's not true

393
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's the same as cutting like this

394
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You just have to do it like this

395
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why?

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's right

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You have to do it like this

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You can't do it like this

399
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You have to do it slowly

400
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You have to put it in the box quickly

401
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's why you have to cut it like this

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's not true

403
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What?

404
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's...

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

406
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you talking about?

407
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why do you have to do it like that?

408
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's why you have to do it quickly

409
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You have to do it quickly

410
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why do you have to do it quickly to put it in the box?

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There are so many melons

412
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
When I'm done with this, I'll go to the other side

413
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll put it in the truck like this

414
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But there are also melons over there

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The melons are waiting in the truck

416
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's not true

417
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What is it?

418
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why did you leave it like that?

419
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's easier to hold if it's like this
