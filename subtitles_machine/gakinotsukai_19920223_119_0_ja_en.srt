1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The secret of Japan.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here, in the outskirts of Tokyo,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
there are few people who know that there is an air pocket that has been forgotten since the present day.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The sound of the wild beast that roars in the dense forest.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The information that demons lurk in the mouth of this secret is embedded in our program.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The last catharsis of the 20th century.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The phantom pearl.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The white-haired bat.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good morning.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Good morning.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's so cold.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I couldn't sleep last night.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I talked to Mr. Osaki yesterday,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and he said it was too dangerous,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and he wanted to quit.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But after I killed him,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the whole of Japan became a mess.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then let's do it.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll use this.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't die.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can't stop.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm scared.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm scared.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Captain Hamada felt something.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Something just moved.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's shoot it.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you okay?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you okay?

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What is this?

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Huge footprints.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There is indeed a phantom pearl.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Are these footprints?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey, is it this big?

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's been here for a long time.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's here.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's here.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's connected.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is this?

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What is it?

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What is it?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is it really a phantom pearl?

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He found something unexpected.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Be careful.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is this?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is it the wreckage of the pearl's food?

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or is it a human bone?

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And then...

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What is it?

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What is it?

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Stop it.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What is this?

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What is this?

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yamazaki!

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey!

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The members are nervous.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yamazaki!

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey!

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yamazaki!

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yamazaki!

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yamazaki was the first victim.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yamazaki!

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hey!

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yamazaki!

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yamazaki!

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hey!

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What was that sound just now?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think it's coming from me.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yamazaki!

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't go!

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Be careful!

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't go!

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't go!

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't go!

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't go!

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yamazaki, what should we do?

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you doing?

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey!

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey!

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yamazaki!

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yamazaki!

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yamazaki!

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The pearl, the white-tailed bat, has come to life.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yamazaki! Yamazaki!

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The white-tailed bat, which emits a mysterious ray of light, has become extremely violent.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yamazaki!

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yamazaki!

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yamazaki!

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yamazaki!

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yamazaki!

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's save him!

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You idiot!

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're not going to do anything right?

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
Happy new year!

96
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,520
Hey...!

97
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,520
What are you laughing at?

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,520
You're making me laugh.

99
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Don't make fun of me anymore.

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Let's go together.

101
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,520
With the help of the research team, the human crisis was avoided.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,520
However, in order to fight the next beast, the research team did not have a peaceful day.

103
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Hello.

104
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Oh, man.

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm so tired.

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
I'm so tired.

107
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm so, so tired.

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
By the way, Mr. Old Dog.

109
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Who are you?

110
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Who is Mr. Old Dog?

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Where is your punch today?

112
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
It's always here.

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Who is Mr. Old Dog?

114
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
You're wearing the clothes you wore today.

115
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I brought the clothes I wore today.

116
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
My stylist, too.

117
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
That's right.

118
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm wearing clothes today.

119
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Well, it's been a while since I've been a servant of this kid.

120
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm taking a break from last week and the week before.

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Why did you take a break?

122
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Well, you know, I'm getting tired of saying it now.

123
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
That's what I'm saying.

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
That's what I'm saying.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I'm saying this and that.

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:50,520
I just wanted to show everyone that I pulled that face to the Polaroid and did this.

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Well, a little bit.

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm sure everyone will pull it.

129
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
No, no one will laugh when they see that face.

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Well, I don't know.

131
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
I don't think it's me.

132
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
It was really terrible.

133
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
It was terrible.

134
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
I only look at the face of the day it burned.

135
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,520
If that happens on the second day of the first day, it will be even worse.

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
That's right.

137
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,520
If it's the next day, I'll be right here.

138
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,520
No, it was that bad.

139
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
That's what I'm saying.

140
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
That's what I'm saying.

141
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
That's what I'm saying.

142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
That's what I'm saying.

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
That's what I'm saying.

144
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,520
My face is all over the place, but yours is all over the place.

145
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
The ball is good.

146
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,520
The ball is good, but mine is all over the place.

147
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,520
It's because of the smoke.

148
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
That's what I'm saying.

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
That's what I wanted to say.

150
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Really?

151
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
That's what I wanted to say.

152
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
That's what I wanted to say.

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
That's what I wanted to say.

154
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Everyone will come the next day.

155
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Everyone will come.

156
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
I won't stop.

157
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
What?

158
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
At home?

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Yes, in my dad's pajamas.

160
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Really?

161
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
At home?

162
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Yes, in my dad's pajamas.

163
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
What about that?

164
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
At home?

165
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Yes.

166
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
At home?

167
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
What?

168
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:12,520
At home?

169
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,520
What?

170
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:24,520
I couldn't go home if I exposed my face, so I put on my glasses and it was even scarier.

171
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,520
It was even scarier. Your face was covered in blood, right?

172
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Yes, yes, yes.

173
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
No, really.

174
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
It was like a disease.

175
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
It was like a disease.

176
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,520
When I took my eyes off, both of my eyes were like this beautiful...

177
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Shut up.

178
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
My eyes were like this beautiful...

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
What's beautiful?

180
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Hey, that's perfect.

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
It was like a picture.

182
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
It was amazing, right?

183
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,520
That was terrible.

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Even if you look at it, it's like...

185
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
It's like a double panchama.

186
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
That's right.

187
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I've been on stage like this for a while now.

188
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,520
I thought it might be impossible in this world.

189
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
What?

190
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
What?

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,520
First of all, when it came out like this, it was no joke.

192
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
It was a great shock.

193
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:17,520
It was a shock that my face was covered in blood.

194
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I thought I could take my nose off without joking.

195
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
It hurt like this.

196
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Like this?

197
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I was scared to look in the mirror.

198
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
I thought I could take my nose off like this.

199
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I really thought I could take my nose off.

200
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,520
I looked for it.

201
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I thought I couldn't take it off.

202
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
There was a camera, and I couldn't show my nose.

203
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I looked for it.

204
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Like this with my feet.

205
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
I thought I couldn't take it off.

206
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
There's nothing that looks like a nose.

207
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
There must be a nose.

208
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
But I thought my nose was broken.

209
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,520
I thought about a lot of things.

210
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,520
When I looked in the mirror, it came out like this.

211
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,520
I don't do that kind of comedy anymore.

212
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm going to do comedy with a tongue twister.

213
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
With a tongue twister.

214
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I'm going to do comedy with a tongue twister.

215
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm scared to think about it.

216
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
What?

217
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm scared to think about it.

218
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,520
But even if I fall here, I won't get hurt.

219
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
You're fooling around.

220
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
I fell from there.

221
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,520
You fell like this.

222
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,520
You fell like this, and you got hurt here.

223
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
It doesn't matter if I fall.

224
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,520
If I fall here, my head will break.

225
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
I don't understand.

226
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I won't get hurt if I fall.

227
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,520
You fell here, and you got hurt here.

228
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,520
You fell here, and you got hurt here.

229
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,520
You fell here, and you got hurt here.

230
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,520
If I fell here, I would get hurt.

231
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
It doesn't matter if I fall here.

232
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,520
When I said that, it hurt a little.

233
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
It hurt a little.

234
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
It's because you got hurt.

235
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,520
You fell here, and you got hurt here.

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,520
That's why I'm scared.

237
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,520
What's wrong with you?

238
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,520
You shouldn't do experiments.

239
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,520
You're bullying your body.

240
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Today, from 6 o'clock in the morning,

241
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,520
from 6 o'clock in the morning, we went to a location.

242
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
It was cold.

243
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I was wearing a skirt.

244
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
I was wearing a skirt from 6 o'clock in the morning.

245
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
He was a pervert.

246
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
His fingers were torn.

247
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,520
It was hard.

248
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,520
After that, we went to a location.

249
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
It was cold. Where was it?

250
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Odaiba.

251
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,520
It was windy.

252
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
We went there.

253
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,520
You don't like it, do you?

254
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
It's true.

255
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Don't you hate it?

256
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
CX and Nittere.

257
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,520
CX was trying to eat us.

258
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,520
CX was trying to eat us.

259
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,520
But only his right hand was left.

260
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

261
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Please tell me how you grew up.

262
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm a fortune teller.

263
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
But I can't see your past.

264
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I smell something criminal.

265
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,520
A smell of crime.

266
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,520
I'm often told this.

267
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I don't have siblings or parents.

268
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm the only child in the world.

269
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,520
I can't see my family.

270
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I see.

271
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,520
But to be honest, I'm a normal person.

272
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I'm a rich person.

273
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:20,520
If it was yakiniku, you would have been raised in a winery.

274
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,520
What are you talking about?

275
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
You smell like a criminal.

276
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,520
You smell more like a criminal.

277
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,520
You're amazing.

278
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
What?

279
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,520
How many times have you touched other people's things?

280
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Gasoline.

281
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Foreigners' underwear.

282
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
You're the same.

283
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
But in the end, they went to you.

284
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,520
That's right.

285
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Your grandma's underwear.

286
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
You too.

287
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
You took your grandma's underwear.

288
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
That's right.

289
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
In the end, they went to you.

290
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Let me borrow it.

291
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
I gave it back to you in the end.

292
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,520
In the end, your grandma's underwear.

293
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,520
You took your grandma's underwear.

294
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Don't say that.

295
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,520
I don't smell like a criminal.

296
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,520
I don't smell like a criminal.

297
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,520
You stole sweets, didn't you?

298
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Sweets?

299
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,520
I don't like sweets.

300
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Didn't you have a hard time on Valentine's Day?

301
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Why?

302
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Chocolate.

303
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
What should I do?

304
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
I can't eat it.

305
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Don't you get angry every year?

306
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I threw it away right away.

307
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I don't care.

308
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
I'll keep throwing it away.

309
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm a cool guy.

310
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Bang!

311
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Don't take it.

312
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I threw it away right away.

313
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I don't care.

314
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm a fool.

315
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
I don't care.

316
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,520
I can't hold it.

317
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
What's wrong with you?

318
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

319
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm a fool.

320
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Your friends are strict.

321
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
My friends are strict.

322
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
You're terrible.

323
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
You're terrible.

324
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
You're terrible.

325
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Tease me.

326
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Yoko too.

327
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I don't care about Yoko.

328
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Pick it up and throw it away.

329
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,520
They'll be upset.

330
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Because you don't give them much.

331
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I don't eat sweets.

332
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:57,520
You're crazy.

333
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Hatcha! The one who gave me the other day.

334
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
When I pulled the string, Mickey Mouse was like...

335
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Katakatakatakataka!

336
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
That's true.

337
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Mickey Mouse is a cat.

338
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
What makes me angry is...

339
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Please eat my handmade chocolate!

340
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
It's not handmade at all!

341
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Why?

342
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
It's just melted and put in my shoulder.

343
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
It's because I bought it from the Kakao store.

344
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Yesterday, when I was on my way home from school,

345
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I was about to buy coffee at the vending machine.

346
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Five or six elementary school students were playing next to me.

347
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
I thought something was bothering them,

348
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
but one of them said,

349
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Hey, this girl!

350
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
She's cheating!

351
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
She's buying coffee!

352
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Why is she in Yamazaki?

353
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
That's what she said.

354
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
If she drinks coffee, she's cheating, right?

355
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
That's how kids are.

356
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Oh, really?

357
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Yeah.

358
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Coffee is...

359
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,520
That's how kids think.

360
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
You know,

361
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
when they say,

362
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Hey, look at that!

363
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
and you look at them,

364
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
and they say,

365
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Look at the blue pig's ass!

366
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
It's crazy!

367
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
You're not going to say what you said?

368
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I couldn't say that.

369
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Really?

370
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
What was it?

371
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Your mom is a dick!

372
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I didn't know that.

373
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
It's not a big deal.

374
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
But if you say that,

375
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
the kid will be like,

376
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Don't say that!

377
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
It's not like I admit it.

378
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
I don't know if she's a dick or not.

379
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
It's just that the tone is different.

380
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,520
This weird way of saying it.

381
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
It's like she's making fun of you, right?

382
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

383
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
It's like,

384
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Your dad is a man!

385
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Don't say that!

386
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
That's what she said.

387
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,520
I don't think she heard it clearly.

388
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
I think she said something.

389
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
She said, Your dad!

390
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
When she said that,

391
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
she was like,

392
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
You're a man!

393
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
I don't know what she said.

394
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
It's weird.

395
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
There's a weird kid.

396
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
It's a kid.

397
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I feel sorry for her.

398
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
What is it?

399
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
The kid with glasses.

400
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
He's wearing glasses.

401
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Yeah.

402
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Even a little kid.

403
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Yeah.

404
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
That's cute.

405
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
That's cute.

406
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
But if it's a little kid,

407
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I don't know what to do.

408
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Yeah.

409
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
When I was on the Shinkansen,

410
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
There was a family trip.

411
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
There were five families.

412
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
They were all wearing glasses.

413
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,520
They were all wearing glasses.

414
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Like this.

415
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
They were facing each other.

416
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,520
They were all like this.

417
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Don't say that.

418
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
It's true.

419
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
The glasses are matching.

420
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
They were all like this.

421
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
When I saw Fujii,

422
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,520
they were all like this.

423
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
It's true.

424
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
The color was interesting.

425
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
When I saw Fujii,

426
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
they were all like this.

427
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
They were all like this.

428
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I couldn't wait for three hours.

429
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
They were all sleeping.

430
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
When the show was about to end in Tokyo,

431
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
the five of them woke up.

432
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,520
They were all like this.

433
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Don't lie to me.

434
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
It's true.

435
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
It's true.

436
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
When the show was about to end,

437
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
they were all like this.

438
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Okay, okay.

439
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Hurry up.

440
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Okay.

441
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Let's go home.

442
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm serious.

443
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,520
What are you doing?

444
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
If you're laughing like that,

445
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,520
what am I supposed to do?

446
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
I talked to Mr. Osaki yesterday.

447
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
He said it was dangerous,

448
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
so he wanted to quit.

449
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
What did he say?

450
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:41,520
He said he had a sore throat.

451
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Why are you laughing?

452
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I talked to Mr. Osaki yesterday.

453
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,520
He said it was dangerous,

454
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,520
so he wanted to quit.

455
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,520
What are you doing?

456
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Come on.

457
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I talked to Mr. Osaki yesterday.

458
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:29,520
What are you doing?
