00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Last week, you must have seen the heartwarming events of the two of them.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The one who stood out was the quiet hot spring town of Yamanashi, Isawa.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In this town filled with smoke and rain, Ikko had a big party to relieve his daily fatigue.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
However, the performance that was done mainly by the staff was not good enough.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A-chan is close!

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a little funny!

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A-chan is close!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a little funny!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the staff's comedy was just a slip of the tongue.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're such a wimp!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll give you a heart attack!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In particular, the stage of the comedy show was too cold.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I knew it!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Um...

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, that's...

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We've been hungry for a while now!

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What are you doing?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The party ended at 6 a.m. four hours later.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Matsumoto, who is a good friend, finally carried out the plan after a long time.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the morning, it was just the two of them's birthday.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The plan is to sneak into Hama-chan's room while she's asleep and throw a birthday party just for the two of them.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Happy birthday to you!

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Happy birthday to you!

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Happy birthday dear Hama-chan!

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Happy birthday to you!

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Happy birthday!

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What are you doing?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Happy birthday! You're 24 years old!

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm so glad!

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Happy birthday!

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I thought it was a lonely birthday.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You like yakisoba, don't you?

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, I do.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Look!

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What are you doing?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm going to make a lot of sauce.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to make a lot of sauce.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where's Matsumoto?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Where's Matsumoto?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
See you tomorrow.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, it's good.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What are you doing?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you doing?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know how to make it.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know how to make it.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know how to make it.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know how to make it.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But in the midst of this heartwarming birthday, there was a guy.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm angry.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you angry?

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm angry.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why are you angry?

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The staff and Matsumoto are still awake at this time of the day.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We're all awake and working.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But our senior, Yamazaki Hosei, has been sleeping all the time since about 2 o'clock.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know what to do.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's do our best.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll be in the upper room.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you awake?

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm awake.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Slowly.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Turn on the lights.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Slowly, slowly.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Turn on the lights.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm awake.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I fell asleep.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's cute.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I fell asleep.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's cute.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's complete.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a magic.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a magic.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's a magic here, too.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
More.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
One more time.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:38,000
One more time.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm scared.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good morning.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Good morning.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's wrong?

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Everyone's working.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Only Hosei.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's hot.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong?

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's wrong?

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's wrong?

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What do you want to do?

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't know.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's hot.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's hot?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Your thighs are hot?

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you want to do?

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you want to do?

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Your thighs are hot?

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where are you going?

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's hot.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But there was someone else sleeping in Yamazaki.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone's been working since morning.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's no one sleeping.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That person is...

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Who is it?

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Kenji.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Kenji?

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Your face is amazing.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's what I think the most.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm going to put my butt on.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going to put my butt on.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's dazzling.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Smell it.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Smell it.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do your best.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is Nakamura-san.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I sang that song at the White Sea.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's hot.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's hot.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's hot.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You guys slept too much.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Everyone's been working since morning.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In addition, the sub-sub-human writer Suzuki's sleepiness was attacked.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's awake.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's awake.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's funny.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's finish.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing?

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's stop.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's stop.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's fashionable.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's eat.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's dangerous.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Suzuki is dangerous.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
After the commercial, the Isawa hot spring project is still exciting.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
To apologize for sleeping last night, a delicious project from the producer.

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's eat the famous hot spring.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hot spring.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hot spring.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What is that?

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a famous hot spring in Yamanashi.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What kind of famous hot spring?

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is there a reason?

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The reason is...

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's the most delicious hot spring in Yamanashi.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a famous hot spring in Hoto.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What kind of hot spring?

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's like udon.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's go.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's fun.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There are a lot of people.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Chikichiki Suga presents Hot Spring in Hoto at the first Gaki no Tsugaya.

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The five members of Downtown, Yamazaki, and Kokoriko will challenge the famous hot spring in Yamanashi.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The time limit is one hour.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you succeed, you will receive a prize of 1 million yen.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is a present.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I understand.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But it's 100 times.

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's like eating 20 times out of 10.

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't feel like giving a present.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I understand your feelings.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I understand your feelings, too.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I got angry because I got angry.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Machan challenges.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't feel satisfied.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Wait.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let's go.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
1 million yen.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Good luck.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Good luck.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't know if I can eat it all.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You have to eat a lot.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Taste it.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You have to hurry.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's delicious.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It looks delicious.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
One minute has passed.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
One minute has passed.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
One minute has passed.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You have to eat a lot in 30 seconds.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's right.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I will eat from now on.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was waiting for you to have a birthday party alone in the morning.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was very happy.

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We are good friends.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I ate a lot.

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I ate 100 times.

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's delicious.

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The fourth cup is over.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The fifth cup is over.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I will eat 15 more cups.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You have to eat 15 more cups.

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Did you hear that?

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I heard it.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can't eat it.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You are fast.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Answer it.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Please eat it from now on.

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can't eat it.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I will eat it from now on.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Good luck.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's delicious.

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The fifth cup is over.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The fifth cup is over.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I can't eat it.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hama-san, you can eat it.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I want to eat it.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's time.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
50 minutes have passed.

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The eighth cup is over.

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It came out.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It came out.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It came out.

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's pumpkin.

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The noodles are under it.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's called a pumpkin knife.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a lie.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a lie.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hama-chan cleared the eighth cup and touched Yamazaki.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yamazaki was delicious.

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I will eat 70 cups.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey.

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Your pace is bad.

238
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's just a full cup.

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Really?

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a lie.

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's a lie.

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's a lie.

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a lie.

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's a lie.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's a lie.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's a lie.

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a lie.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's a lie.

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In the end, Tanaka...

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's a scheme.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's a lie.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't do that.

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm in a bad mood.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's a lie.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's a waste of time.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You are very naive.

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are very naive.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The remaining time is 30 minutes.

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a pretty bad situation.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a bad situation.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Excuse me.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I have a suggestion.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The program will not be fun.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yamazaki is not funny at all.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He is not funny at all.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is the second time.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He is not funny at all.

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is the second time.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He is not funny at all.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I will change the rule.

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I said 100 cups.

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I said 40 cups.

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I said 40 cups.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I said 40 cups.

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Can ENDO turn the tables?

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
ENDO, that's right.

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
ENDO, that's right.

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I can't taste it.

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's right.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's right.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
ENDO is amazing.

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
ENDO is amazing.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's right.

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's right.

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's right.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm counting on you.

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You are cool.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
15 minutes left.

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He is very good at drinking.

291
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He is very good at drinking.

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He looks like he is drinking.

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He looks like he is drinking.

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
30 cups.

295
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is the last 10 cups.

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You can do it.

297
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You can do it.

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can do it.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You can do it.

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You can do it.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can do it.

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You can do it.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We can't do it.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We should do it.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We are young, so we can't do it.

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We cannot do it.

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We cannot do it.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We can't do it.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We can't do it.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We can't do it.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We cannot do it.

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We can't do it.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We should have 32 cups.

314
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
32 cups.

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Thank you, YAMASAKI.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hey, take it easy.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
YAMASAKI, you can do it.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You have no time.

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
ENDO, ENDO, go.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's all over the place.

321
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's all over the place.

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's all over the place.

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Alright, let's go in. That's the power.

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a bat. It's a bat.

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Endo, the last spurt of anger.

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you eat two more cups, you can go one by one.

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you eat two more cups, you can go one by one.

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm going to push myself. I'm going to push myself from now on.

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
One more cup. One more cup.

331
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Four minutes left.

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's hot.

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's hot.

334
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What was that?

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't like it. I don't like it.

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mom, you said it was hot.

337
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I didn't feel it at all.

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I didn't feel it at all.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Three minutes left.

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Thanks to this, you'll get 1 million yen.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Good luck, Bokoriko.

342
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's really good.

343
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't say that.

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Who's the best?

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Who's the best?

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're still the best.

348
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You're still the best.

349
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You're still the best.

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You're still the best.

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're still the best.

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It came out.

353
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a ghost.

354
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't leave only the pumpkin.

355
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't leave only the pumpkin.

356
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What kind of ghost are you?

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
One minute left.

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Four minutes left.

359
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Four minutes left.

360
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's a miracle.

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a miracle.

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can eat a lot in 30 seconds.

367
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm hungry.

368
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm hungry.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't eat anything.

370
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's the end.

371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's the end.

372
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The end.

373
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't think I can say anything.

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You're making me really angry

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But he still has a chance

376
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm sorry I didn't have any sense of humor

377
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You don't have any sense of humor this time

378
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm going to attack you with all my sense of humor

379
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sorry

380
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Please get involved

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Please get involved

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're stressed out, right?

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm going to do my best here

384
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm going to attack you

385
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There are a lot of people here

386
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's old

387
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't see it

388
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The signboard is amazing

389
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm going to attack you with my face

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're so stupid

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm going to attack you with my face

392
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Chikichiki! Suga presents

393
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Take off your beautiful clothes and do a sexy baseball game

394
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What's your name?

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Anri

396
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Anri

397
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Anri

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm going to play baseball with Anri

399
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Suga gave me 1 million yen

400
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
1 million yen again?

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The rule is that we will play baseball one by one

403
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We are 5 members

404
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If you win 5 people straight and take off all of them

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You will get 1 million yen

406
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I can see such a good thing

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You can get 1 million yen

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's start with Mazumoto

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Really?

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Please

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If you lose, it's over

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If you lose, it's over

413
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you want to play baseball, you have to do it like this

414
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We have to win

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Start from the bottom

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Suga, it's my turn?

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't know if I will lose

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If you lose, you have to do it like this

419
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Amazing

420
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Really?

421
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If you lose, you have to do it like this

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We will win for sure

423
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Really?

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We will win for sure

425
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's a miracle that we won 4 times

426
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't know if it was good

427
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm happy too

428
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's complicated

429
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Thank you

430
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Thank you

431
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's Tanaka

432
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm always like this

433
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
A warm friendship with Machan and Hama-chan

434
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This trip will be engraved in their hearts
