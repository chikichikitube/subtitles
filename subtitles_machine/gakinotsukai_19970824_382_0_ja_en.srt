1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
In the first episode of Gaki no Sky, Tsukiji will announce the opening title of the first half of the show,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,920
Donatte Kandara Kyoufu no Batsuta!

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,920
Coming soon!

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,400
Today, we're going to talk about how we made the opening title.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
The one we did, or the one we just made.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,640
The other day, when we were talking about Mild Seven,

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,360
Kokoriko didn't talk at all.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,080
That's right.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,080
He didn't talk at all.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,080
He didn't say anything.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,680
He didn't say anything!

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,480
He didn't say anything.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,680
His annual salary is 1.8 million yen.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,840
It's fine if he didn't say anything.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,640
Please don't say anything.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,760
He just said it earlier, didn't he?

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,480
If you get stuck or bite someone, you'll be punished.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,240
That's not going to happen.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,200
He didn't say anything.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Why did you say that earlier?

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,400
Ouch!

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
It hurts so much!

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,920
What is this?

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,360
It's a non-skub, isn't it normal?

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm trying to change it.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,760
It's like a good time.

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,360
It got weird after you put on that little glasses.

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,320
Can I take it off?

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,320
No!

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,800
It's not weird. It's not weird.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,440
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,200
The punishment game is called,

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,760
The battle of fear is about to begin.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,960
What is this?

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,040
What's going to happen?

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
It's going to fly up.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
If you avoid it, you'll be punished.

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,400
That's the worst.

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,880
It's the worst as an entertainer.

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,960
Now, Mr. Yamazaki's question is this!

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,000
It's coming up.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Look!

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
Yes.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,560
There was something like this.

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go!

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,240
Three, two, one, go!

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,200
The first time, at the Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
The manager of the downtown,

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,720
Chikichiki Nakimokuro, Okamoto Ta...

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Are you okay?

51
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,400
No!

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,920
Are you sure?

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,720
Yes, I'm sure.

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,600
No!

55
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,040
Are you sure?

56
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,720
No!

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,800
Are you sure?

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
No!

59
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,760
This is shocking.

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,400
Mr. Okamoto!

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,800
Wait a minute, it hurts so much.

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,920
I don't want to get a stomachache.

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,160
I don't want to get a stomachache.

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,960
It's like this.

65
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
Oh, that's how it is.

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Wow, really?

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
Then I'll go.

68
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
My body is getting used to it.

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,680
No, I'm still not used to it.

70
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,440
This is it.

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,360
Yes.

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,520
This is good, though.

73
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's go with full power.

74
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,520
Yes.

75
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,720
Three, two, one, go!

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Gai Gai Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Chikichiki Hamada Mizoshibasu Eikinen,

77
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Amefuto Tournament!

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,680
I knew it.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm used to it.

80
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Let's go.

81
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,920
Endo.

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
Endo is in trouble.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
He said, I'm used to it, but it was weird.

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,000
No, it's not like that.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
It's not like that.

86
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,520
No, it's not like that.

87
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,640
Endo's is this.

88
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,320
I did it, I did it.

89
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
I finally did it.

90
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
I did it.

91
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,520
Let's go.

92
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,160
Three, two, one, go!

93
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,600
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Chikichiki Magoroshi no Chinjuu,

94
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,720
Shiro Techo, Konmori Aikyo...

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,000
Shiro Techo?

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,040
You read it wrong.

97
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,000
Shiro Techo.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,040
The old man's is this.

99
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,760
I'm Sakame.

100
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,240
This is tough.

101
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,000
You're so stubborn!

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,920
What is that?

103
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,560
You're so stubborn!

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Wait a minute.

105
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,440
Wait a minute.

106
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,480
When did I say that?

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,000
You just happened to say that.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,480
Three, two, one, go!

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Matsumoto Kashitayo Hamada,

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Karitenai itte 3000 yen,

112
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Kettei Kikaku, Chikichiki, Hamada,

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,120
Magoroshi!

114
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,320
That's a long one!

115
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
That's a long one!

116
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,520
It's a long one.

117
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Hamada.

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,560
And he changes the attachment to a special weapon.

119
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,840
He can't afford to fail.

120
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,640
The pain of fear is waiting for him.

121
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
This is tough.

122
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm being stubborn.

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,040
Yamasaki's is this.

124
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Three, two, one, go!

125
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,040
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,920
Heta no Yamasaki, Hitori Dachi, Chikichiki,

127
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,080
Yoru no Ohara...

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,760
Are you okay?

129
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,920
Osei-san, are you okay?

130
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,360
He's in great shape right now.

131
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,600
He seems confident.

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
This is the question.

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,400
Okay, let's go.

134
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,280
Wait, wait, wait.

135
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,960
You're still doing it right.

136
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,320
You're still doing it right.

137
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,520
This is tough.

138
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,680
Okay, let's go.

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Three, two, one, go!

140
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,320
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

141
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
Chikichiki, Mezase Shidonin Shirodan,

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,280
Suimi Shouzetsu Shippetsu Taikai!

143
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,000
Amazing.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,280
Did you say Chikichiki?

145
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,320
I did.

146
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,920
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

147
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,400
Jichan Bacchan, Chikichiki,

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Jetsu-chan...

149
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,360
Are you okay?

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,080
You sounded like Jichan Bacchan.

151
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,880
I can't react to this.

152
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,440
I don't want to see you react like that.

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,240
That's weird.

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,760
If this goes on for too long,

155
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm going to have to resign.

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,360
Why are you doing this?

157
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,400
I don't get it.

158
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,160
Don't count me out as a hero.

159
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,200
I don't know about that.

160
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,480
I don't watch TV.

161
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,440
Here's the question.

162
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,760
Three, two, one, go!

163
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,800
There's a reason for this.

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
Why?

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
Can I say it?

166
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,720
Can I say it's a water thing?

167
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,880
Yes, a water thing.

168
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
Here we go.

169
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,400
Three, two, one, go!

170
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,880
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

171
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,560
Okamoto Suichuchu Tago Kaina,

172
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,880
Chikichiki Matakaina,

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Suiwono Kaina!

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,760
That's weird.

175
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,360
What's Suiwono?

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
It's a water thing.

177
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
Ouch!

178
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
You didn't say Chikichiki either.

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
It was a different place.

180
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,760
It was a different place.

181
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
It was a different place.

182
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,160
Ouch!

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
It was a different place.

184
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,160
It was a different place.

185
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
What is this?

186
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,960
It's weird.

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
It's weird.

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,480
This is easy, isn't it?

189
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,200
Little bird.

190
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,880
Here we go.

191
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,480
Three!

192
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,280
This is bad, this is bad.

193
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
What is this?

194
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
This is called Okamoto family.

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,280
What is Okamoto family?

196
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Here we go.

197
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,480
Here we go!

198
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Three, two, one, go!

199
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,880
Dai Tai Gaki no Tsukai Arai,

200
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Shinkon Hoya Hoya,

201
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,680
Chikichiki Matakaina,

202
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Chikichiki Matakaina,

203
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Suiwono Kaina,

204
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Suiwono Kaina,

205
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,080
Suiwono Kaina,

206
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,880
Suiwono Kaina,

207
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,680
Suiwono Kaina,

208
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Suiwono Kaina,

209
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,280
Suiwono Kaina,

210
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,880
Suiwono Kaina,

211
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Suiwono Kaina,

212
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:08,280
Chiki Chiki No Basho, that happens a lot.

213
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Stop pushing!

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Stop pushing!

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Could you please change this?

216
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,600
It stopped.

217
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:14,260
The

218
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:26,560
The next game to be punished

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
is the Paenage Jigoku.

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,600
It's my turn.

221
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Just wait.

222
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
It's so hard to do it.

223
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm so frustrated.

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Tanaka, you have to make the most of your reach.

225
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Wait, that's a punch.

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It's not a punch.

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
The answer is this.

228
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
3, 2, 1, go!

229
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
The first Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

230
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Naita Naita Korai Kiyosu Ni Naitake Grand Prix!

231
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
The answer is this.

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
This is so nostalgic.

233
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
This was about 6 years ago.

234
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
3, 2, 1, go!

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
The first Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Chikichiki Taihaiya Obayashi!

237
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
What are you saying? Taihaiya?

238
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
You're so young.

239
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
The second Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

240
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
The answer is this.

241
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
What is this?

242
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
What is this?

243
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
It's just the order.

244
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
It's just the order.

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Wait a minute.

246
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Give me another chance.

247
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Have you done this before?

248
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Have I done this before?

249
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
If there's something different, you can do the one you've done before.

250
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
This is the first time I've done something new.

251
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
This is the first time I've done something new.

252
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
If it's like this, throw me a pie.

253
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I don't care.

254
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Come on.

255
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
1, 2, come on.

256
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I don't care.

257
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll do it until I make it.

258
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
You've done it before, haven't you?

259
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes, I've done it.

260
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Wait a minute.

261
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
The first Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

262
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
What's wrong with you?

263
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
This is cool.

264
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
3, 2, 1.

265
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Go!

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
The first Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

267
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Super Ultra Super Miracle Magical Rolling

268
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Fighting Melodeus Intro Bon Challenge!

269
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
The second Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

270
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
How many seconds do I have to cool down?

271
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
28 seconds!

272
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
The first Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

273
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Super Ultra Super Miracle Magical Rolling

274
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Fighting Melodeus Intro Bon Challenge!

275
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
You're doing it the right way.

276
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
No matter how you think about it, it's a white group.

277
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
You haven't done it yet, have you?

278
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I've come this far.

279
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Amano-san, you're so beautiful.

280
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Let's do it quickly.

281
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I can't show you the question.

282
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Guess what's written on the back.

283
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Here's the question.

284
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
This is amazing.

285
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
This is amazing.

286
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
You're making a rhythm.

287
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I can't do it.

288
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Why are you holding it?

289
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
3, 2, 1.

290
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Go!

291
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
The first Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

292
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Super Ultra Super Miracle Magical Rolling

293
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Who's the first one?

294
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
You're the first one.

295
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You're the second one.

296
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
There's a mountain of them in my ear.

297
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Super Super Miracle Magical Rolling

298
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
This is the punishment game.

299
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Next week, look forward to it.

300
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
From now on,

301
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
We're going to use a new set.

302
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm going to do it the way I designed it.

303
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Why are you doing it the way you designed it?

304
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm a fan.

305
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I don't like ants either.

306
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm wondering if it'll change during the mid-to-half-past.

307
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm a little more moved.

308
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
You're right.

309
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm a little more like, huh?

310
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
You're so mean.

311
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
It's a bit late today.

312
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
It's already a good time.

313
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
What?

314
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Eri is expensive.

315
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Eri is like this.

316
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I can't. I really don't like it.

317
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Then wait a minute.

318
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Let's do it properly.

319
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm so sick of it.

320
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
You're the worst.

321
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I can't think of anything interesting.

322
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Only the tie and Eri are left.

323
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
This is the only one left.

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Please stop.

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I can't do it.

326
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I really can't do this feeling.

327
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
What's this?

328
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
What's this?

329
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I like that kind of feeling.

330
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Let's do it properly.

331
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Especially this.

332
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
What is it?

333
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I feel like I'm Captain Okita.

334
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
It's bigger.

335
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Captain Okita.

336
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
But I can't take it off.

337
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Let's do it properly.

338
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
The guy wearing a T-shirt told me to do it properly.

339
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Do it properly.

340
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
What is it?

341
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Let me stop.

342
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I can't. I really can't.

343
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I can't do it.

344
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Even if I get hit.

345
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
It stopped.

346
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
It stopped properly.

347
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
It stopped until my eyes.

348
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
What is it?

349
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Do you know interesting news?

350
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
What is it?

351
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Osaka's convenience store.

352
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Do you know it?

353
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Please laugh a little more.

354
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't know it, but I can't laugh.

355
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I was on the newspaper.

356
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
A convenience store worker came in.

357
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
He said he wanted money.

358
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
The gun was made of wood.

359
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I said I wanted money.

360
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,200
The manager took me outside.

361
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
He threw me outside.

362
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
The worker woke up.

363
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
He said, this is all I have today.

364
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
He went home.

365
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
It's a masterpiece.

366
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
That's my line.

367
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
The manager said.

368
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
It's funny.

369
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
It's funny.

370
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
What are you doing?

371
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Who are you?

372
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
It's a funny story.

373
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
It's a funny story.

374
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Don't put it in.

375
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't put it in.

376
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm doing it right.

377
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Put it out.

378
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Shut up.

379
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm sorry.

380
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
This is the last problem.

381
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
It's really bad.

382
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I think there's a reason.

383
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
What do you do when you wear a jacket?

384
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Do you stop it?

385
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I don't stop it when I wear a jacket.

386
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I don't stop it when I wear a jacket.

387
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I don't do that.

388
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't stop it when I wear a jacket.

389
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,200
The secret is still a secret.

390
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Is that so?

391
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,200
It's been a while since I've seen you up close.

392
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,200
What were you doing up close?

393
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I was working up close.

394
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
I'm a loner.

395
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
When I'm alone, I think,

396
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Did you see something?

397
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I've never seen it.

398
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I've never seen it.

399
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I've never seen it.

400
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
It's like a white wall.

401
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
If you keep looking at me like this, I'll definitely see it.

402
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
That's what it's like.

403
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I've said this before, but there's a lot of strange things.

404
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
When I buy a new car, I think,

405
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm going to buy a new car soon.

406
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
What are you talking about?

407
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I want to go home soon.

408
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
You want to go home?

409
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You're going to buy a new car, right?

410
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I was thinking about buying a new car.

411
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
My car went wrong.

412
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You can't figure that out in science.

413
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
The worst thing I've ever done was,

414
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I was driving on New Year's Eve.

415
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I don't know what it is, but the wiper.

416
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,200
The wiper came off.

417
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
It can't come off, can it?

418
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Do you understand?

419
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I was driving on the highway, and the rubber came out.

420
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
It came out.

421
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,200
No way!

422
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
The rubber came out.

423
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
The rubber came out.

424
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
The rubber came out.

425
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
The rubber came out.

426
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
The rubber came out.

427
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
No way!

428
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
That's a bad habit.

429
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
It just happened.

430
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
It just happened.

431
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
That's not true.

432
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
When you do something like that,

433
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
you don't have love for your car.

434
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I have love for my car,

435
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
that's why I don't hate it.

436
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I love it so much,

437
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
I want to work hard until the end.

438
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
That's not true.

439
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
You don't want to leave me.

440
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
That's why I don't want to leave you.

441
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
That's why I want you to take care of me.

442
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
It's a problem for the owner.

443
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,200
It's a problem, but when I fix it

444
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
on a rainy day,

445
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I feel good.

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
I get angry when the rubber is in.

447
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Who says that?

448
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I get angry when the rubber is in.

449
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I get angry.

450
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I don't like it.

451
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
The car.

452
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Do you understand?

453
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
I understand.

454
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Is all ok?

455
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
It's not all.

456
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Mostly, right?

457
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I get it, I get it.

458
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Hey, Sora, that's fine.

459
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
TAKUAAA!

460
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
That eccentric voice...

461
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Thank you very much.

462
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
It's a question for Komadamu's famous Matsumoto-san.

463
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
It's Sora-san, yes.

464
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,200
In general, it's fine, but what is Matsumoto-san's My Boom, which is the only thing that's popular among you?

465
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Right now, My Boom is over, but...

466
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
It's a song-and-dance battle within the company.

467
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I see.

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
What's next?

469
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
What do you mean? Listen!

470
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Eh?

471
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
What do you mean? Listen!

472
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Ah, ah, ah.

473
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
What kind of feeling is that?

474
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,200
You see, my car has about 6 CDs.

475
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
While listening to them in the car,

476
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Nakajima Miyuki is also in it, but...

477
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
It's a battle between the red team and the white team.

478
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I see.

479
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
It's a battle between the red team and the white team.

480
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I see.

481
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Right now, the red team is Yusei.

482
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I see.

483
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Next time, I'll call A-chan and say,

484
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Oh, the white team is working hard, too!

485
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I see.

486
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's a song-and-dance battle within the company.

487
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I see.

488
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I want the name of Heisei's Socrates.

489
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Matsumoto-san, who has been coming every year since a few hundred performances...

490
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Ah, wait a minute.

491
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I'm already done writing.

492
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,200
My My Boom is still going on, even after the commercials.

493
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Ah, is that so?

494
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
That's one thing.

495
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Well, that's one thing.

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
That's one thing.

497
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
The rest is...

498
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I did this earlier, too.

499
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Yes.

500
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
When I went to the bathroom...

501
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Yes.

502
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Well...

503
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Let's talk about the actual story.

504
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
This...

505
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I'm going to show you this.

506
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Hey, wait, wait.

507
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Where is it locked?

508
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Is it here?

509
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
No, no, no.

510
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
It's locked like this.

511
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
What?

512
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
It's locked like this.

513
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
This is how you do it.

514
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
This is how you do it.

515
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Well, this is how you do it.

516
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
You can't do anything, can you?

517
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
I'll show you, but...

518
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Yes, yes, yes.

519
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
At that time, it's a little funny that I can't use my hands.

520
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
A little...

521
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm laughing.

522
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
What do you mean?

523
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,200
I took it out with my hands and did it like this.

524
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Well...

525
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Well...

526
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I can't support it at all.

527
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I can't support it at all.

528
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
What am I talking about?

529
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Explain it properly.

530
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I thought I could support it at all.

531
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
This guy was called and jumped out.

532
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,200
But even though I took it out, I didn't support it at all.

533
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,200
So I thought I couldn't do anything, so I just showed it to him.

534
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
That's why it's funny.

535
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
I want the name of Heisei's Socrates.

536
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I'd like to ask Mr. Matsumoto who comes to the park every year.

537
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Yes.

538
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Three philosophical talks of Mr. Matsumoto.

539
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Is that okay?

540
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
What is happiness?

541
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
What is life?

542
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
What is a best friend?

543
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I see.

544
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Don't be so quiet.

545
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
It's okay.

546
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm a philosopher.

547
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm a philosopher of Mr. Matsumoto.

548
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Yes.

549
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
What is happiness?

550
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Yes, please.

551
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
What is happiness?

552
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:31,200
It's not realizing that you're unhappy.

553
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,200
You can't say that.

554
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,200
That was really cool.

555
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
What is life?

556
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,200
What is life?

557
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,200
That's what I'm thinking right now.

558
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Don't put it out.

559
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
What?

560
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,200
When you're on the phone, you say hello first.

561
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Please tell me what that means.

562
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

563
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Actually, I want to change it.

564
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
But it's hard to change.

565
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
You have to change this.

566
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
It's the age of the universe.

567
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
If you can change it, it's revolutionary.

568
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I want to expand my view of the universe.

569
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I want to change it to Cosmos.

570
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Cosmos?

571
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Cosmos!

572
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Cosmos!

573
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
It's just a pun.

574
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
What's wrong with a pun?

575
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,200
It's hard to change your view of the universe.

576
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I want to change it to Cosmos.

577
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,200
But you're thinking it's a good idea.

578
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Cosmos?

579
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Cosmos!

580
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Cosmos!

581
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm sure you can say that.

582
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
You said that, right?

583
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
I think he said it in the car on the way home.

584
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Cosmos!

585
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Cosmos!

586
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:34,200
