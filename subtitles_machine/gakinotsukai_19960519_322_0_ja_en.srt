1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please listen to me!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're not good at it!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Why am I not good at it?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're not good at it!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It has nothing to do with it!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's a reason for it!

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It has nothing to do with it!

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please listen to me!

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm really sorry about the other day.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I apologize.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What do you mean by the other day?

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Ah, the super-dirty thing.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you very much for telling me about the super-dirty thing.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I saw it with my own eyes, but it wasn't super-dirty at all!

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's not good.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not good at all!

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Last time, Yamazaki's one-man show of affection didn't reach his opponent.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It ended in failure.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's why, today, I'll do my best!

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Your best?

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My best!

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll do my best with all my heart and soul!

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're so noisy.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
People are passing by.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You don't know your position.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're a good-for-nothing.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're a good-for-nothing!

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Today, I really mean it.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's why, today...

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why are you here all of a sudden?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today, I'll make you meet a wonderful person.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You'll make me feel good?

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And I'll make you dirty.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll make you dirty?

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll make you dirty!

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Dirty entertainer.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's the end of a long journey in the entertainment world.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Everyone else avoids the dirty entertainer.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The second episode of Yamazaki Super Dirty.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who will be today's opponent?

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please watch.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll make you dirty!

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll make you dirty!

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why are you making me dirty all of a sudden?

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Excuse me.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Excuse me.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hello.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're not cute at all.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm really busy today.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's okay.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Just relax.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nice to meet you. I'm Hosei.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You came before?

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Really?

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've seen you before.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Really?

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't say anything.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you nervous?

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you nervous?

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You have a wide shoulder.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How tall are you?

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
42 cm?

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can't see.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't see.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I really can't see.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who are you?

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What character do you want to be?

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Excuse me.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Really?

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's a lot of water here.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's amazing.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Excuse me.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There's a lot of water here.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you want to see my nails?

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Your nails are long.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your nails are really hard.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your nails are really hard.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have a lot of hair.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's funny.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you doing?

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Excuse me.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
First of all, I'd like to have a powder.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm tired.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Excuse me.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Excuse me.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're pale.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have a lot of hair.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have a lot of hair.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't laugh.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want to laugh.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I have a lot of hair.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have a lot of hair.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Excuse me.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's been a while.

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What do you want to do?

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Excuse me.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Please sit down.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's embarrassing.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll show you.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Excuse me.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Excuse me.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's beautiful.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your butt is round.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your butt is round.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What?

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It hurts.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you okay?

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Excuse me.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What are you doing?

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll put it in your butt.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's coming out.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's coming out?

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing?

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Excuse me.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Please sit down.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's the thing.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It hurts.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Excuse me.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please sit down.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Please sit down.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't want to call you.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't want to call you.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Excuse me.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please sit down.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Please sit down.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Please sit down.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I took it off.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a mistake.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a good timing.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How was it?

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're wearing panties.

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How was it?

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was fun.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It was fun.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I did my best today.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I wonder if the people watching TV will laugh.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm not making them laugh, I'm making them laugh.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I see.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I hope there will be a next time.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes, I'll do my best next time.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to ask the child caretaker to do it.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hello, I'm a woman.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, no.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, yes.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to watch TV from now on.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, no, no.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's rude.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm wearing panties.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's normal to watch TV like this.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There are times when you wear slippers.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Slippers?

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's barefoot.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What is this?

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's a costume for buying Caster Mild.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like this.

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's take a burst shot.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Really?

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know what this is.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What is this?

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's the costume I wore yesterday.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The costume?

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Only I know.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Is this the costume you wore yesterday?

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why are you doing this?

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't do foot acting.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, no.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I said it from my nails.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I said it would be revealed.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You said it too much.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, no.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The other person is wearing it.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What do you call that?

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What do you call this?

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How do you call this?

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How do you call this?

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How do you call this?

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We call it Dotsun.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What?

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm scared.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, no.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How do you call this?

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Say it again.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, no.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
How do you call this?

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Goodbye.

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is really hard.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can't do this.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why?

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You said it from your nails.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, no.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't wear socks.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't do this.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is this?

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What is this?

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a castor mild.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, no.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't wear it at all.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's a burst shot today.

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How do you call this?

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, no.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I said Dotsun yesterday.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I know it.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone knows it.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What do you call this?

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This?

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No.

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why are you doing this?

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't do foot acting.

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I said it from my nails.

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You said it too fast.

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, I'm trying too hard.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You said it from your nails.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know anymore.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't do what I used to do.

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's right.

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't do it anymore.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can't do it anymore.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's true.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to be like Hamada Masato.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's too fast.

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going to be like him.

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm going to be like Hamada Masato.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to be like him.

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's true.

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Congratulations.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why are you clapping?

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What do you mean congratulations?

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know.

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Seriously.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm going to be like Joe Yabanzuke.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What?

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did you kill him?

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why?

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're number one.

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Congratulations on being number two.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't want to talk about this.

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But there's going to be another announcement tomorrow or the day after.

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was going to do it earlier.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Everyone, look at this.

254
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is number one.

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Number one has a nose like this.

256
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But next year, I'm not going to be in the top ten.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not going to do anything bad.

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I originally had that kind of income.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But something happened.

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're definitely going to be number one next year.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why do you say that?

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, no, no.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm going to release a lot of CDs.

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How many times have I said that?

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't say that.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're a fool.

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You have a lot of money.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You have a lot of money.

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is that true?

270
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's true.

271
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You have a lot of money.

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you sell a million or two million copies, what kind of pose is that?

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I thought it was a little hard.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I just did it like this.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's like something's going to start from here.

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's scary.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's scary.

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
When I was in front of you the other day, there was a toilet like this.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't you know?

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Look.

281
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's like this.

282
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you know?

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Look carefully.

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't look at me with thin eyes.

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Look at me clearly.

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I know.

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's like this.

288
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I know.

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know.

290
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There was blood.

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Was that a man's toilet?

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yes.

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What do you think?

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Wasn't it a man's toilet?

295
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, no, no.

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Was it a man's toilet?

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes.

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What do you think?

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I looked at the toilet and there was blood.

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was surprised.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I was worried.

303
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There was blood on the toilet.

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Was it on this part of the toilet seat?

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, no.

306
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I have to go to the toilet.

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There are times when you go to the toilet like this.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No, no.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's on the right side of the toilet.

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You have to say that.

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There was blood on this part.

312
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I thought it was our joke.

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There was blood on your shoulder.

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There is no such thing as a scary thing.

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What are you talking about?

316
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There was blood on your shoulder.

317
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I remember that.

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If that was the case, you should have gone to the toilet.

319
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What is that?

320
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Did you look at the ceiling at that time?

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Maybe the blood was coming from the ceiling.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I didn't see that.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why was there blood coming from the ceiling?

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Maybe it was leaking from the toilet space.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What is it?

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Maybe it was leaking from the space above.

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What?

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The upper part of the toilet room is a toilet seen as a fact.

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I see.

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why did you say that?

331
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Something was on the up part.

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There was something on top of the toilet.

333
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Maybe there was blood on the upper part of the toilet.

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You should not look at the upper part of the roof.

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Maybe there was nothing there.

336
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What do you mean by that?

337
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's a happy ending.

338
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What are you talking about?

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
At that time, I can't be happy.

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There are such strange things.

341
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is that so?

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's unimaginable.

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I used to say this before, but I sometimes say this.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I went to the bathroom and came out.

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I went to the bathroom and came out.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
When I looked at it, there was a lot of shit on my nose.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What kind of life are you living?

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is...

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There are such strange things.

354
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wait a minute.

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This is a little too funny.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why did you go to the bathroom and come out?

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't know, but there are such things.

358
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm your...

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What is it?

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm your...

361
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Are you a Satsuma person?

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm doing a lot of rose-colored life right now.

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm doing it now.

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Is there anyone you want me to look for?

365
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why?

366
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Tochi's mother.

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You used to work part-time.

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You were dug up.

369
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You were dug up.

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You were dug up.

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is there anyone you want me to look for?

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There's only one person.

373
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Who?

374
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

375
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Do you know Shakutani?

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I know.

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm looking for Shakutani.

378
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why?

379
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why do you call me?

380
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a good story.

381
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I had a hard time saying goodbye to Shakutani.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is that so?

383
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, there was a guy called Shakutani.

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
When I was in elementary school, I had a lot of friends.

385
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You just want to say Shakutani.

386
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No, no, no.

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shakutani was a little bullied.

388
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But we were good friends.

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
For some reason, I couldn't bully Shakutani.

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Is that so?

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Shakutani was very...

392
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You really wanted to say that.

393
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No, I didn't.

394
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Shakutani was very fond of me.

395
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Really?

396
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Shakutani and I were taking a dump on our way home from school.

397
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then Shakutani started saying,

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I got a mole.

399
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's why I can't bully you.

400
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then we went to Shakutani's house.

401
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Shakutani went to change his underwear.

402
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I was waiting for him at home.

403
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I said, I'm sorry.

404
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Then I took off my underwear and wiped it.

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then I changed my underwear to blue.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was watching it all the time.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Shakutani said,

408
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't tell anyone about this.

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll be bullied again.

410
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I said, I can't say that.

411
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I said a lot the next day.

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Then Shakutani was bullied a lot.

413
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He looked at me with a grumpy face.

414
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There are children like that.

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes, there are.

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If I told him to stop there, I might be bullied.

417
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I thought I had to apologize to Shakutani.

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
From then on, my relationship with Shakutani became strange.

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's right.

420
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Shakutani was betrayed.

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's great.

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Then I moved to Shakutani.

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Shakutani couldn't catch up with me.

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't like it when you say that now.

425
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't know what Shakutani is doing.

426
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know where Shakutani moved to.

427
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's great.

428
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm looking for someone like that.

429
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I have to apologize to Shakutani.

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then let's go out.

431
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm going to meet Shakutani again.

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm a scary old man.

433
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What are you going to do?

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm going to be a yakuza from now on.

435
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Shakutani.

436
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know who Shakutani is.

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know why.

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Shakutani.

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who produces all the CM songs, lyrics, and choreography.

440
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I heard that there is a sequel to that song.

441
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What kind of song is it?

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Are you the one who choreographed the choreography?

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes, I am.

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I've been thinking about it for three days.

445
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Really?

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What kind of lyrics was it?

447
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Let's choose a wife, Mirin.

448
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's choose a wife, Mirin.

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's do it twice.

450
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Let's do it twice.

451
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's do it twice.

452
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You chose that song, didn't you?

453
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's probably because it's me.

454
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What?

455
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's probably because it's me.

456
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You asked me to do it.

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes.

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I asked you to do it.

459
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hiromi usually says good things about me.

460
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Hiromi?

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I gave her my advice.

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
How many years ago?

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You're an amateur.

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Please tell me the sequel.

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is the first version.

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a regular Koterinko, right?

468
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes.

469
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Next is Koterinko Mini.

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I see.

471
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Next is Koterinko Curry.

472
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's Mirin.

473
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Why does it taste like curry?

474
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's choose a wife, Mirin.

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That one, right?

476
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, that one.

477
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Next is let's choose a wife, Mirin.

478
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What are you talking about?

479
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you know this one?

480
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Wife.

481
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You're just pretending.

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's choose a wife, Mirin.

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Koterinko.

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Next one is a new one.

485
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's choose a wife, Mirin.

486
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What are you talking about?

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wife, wife.

488
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Why is this a wife?

489
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why is this a wife?

490
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't care.

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Please look at it.

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It will be released soon.

493
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Really?

494
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

495
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It will be released soon.

496
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Did you just say hey?

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Why do you keep saying hey?

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Matsumoto-san, who won the first time in Koshien as a first-year ace, but left the baseball world for some reason.

499
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When you lose in Koshien at 9 o'clock in high school, you take the soil home, but what do you use that soil for?

500
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Did you take it home?

501
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I didn't lose, so I didn't take it home.

502
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There are many people who think that they take the soil home because they lost in Koshien.

503
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I see.

504
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I didn't take the soil home because I lost in Koshien.

505
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why?

506
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If you lose, you have to take the soil home.

507
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's not because of baseball.

508
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That tradition only remains in high school baseball.

509
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
For example, if you like a woman and she changes her clothes, you don't take the soil home.

510
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because it's a complete defeat.

511
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Even if you lose in that sense, you don't take it home.

512
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's right.

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's not just high school baseball.

514
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Where did you change your clothes and find out?

515
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
For example, when I went to her house and tried to do it, it smelled really bad.

516
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I have no choice but to cry.

517
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I cry a lot.

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You don't have to cry.

519
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I sing a song.

520
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What?

521
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I sing a song.

522
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There?

523
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
There.

524
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
While crying?

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
While crying.

526
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Then I take the soil from the garden in that house and run home.

527
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You have to run.

528
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It looks like a nail.
