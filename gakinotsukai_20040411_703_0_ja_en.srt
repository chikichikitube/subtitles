1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm serious.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just be careful about that.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And keep up with me.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm counting on you.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Nice.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Excuse me, Hamada-san said that you're a powder-son.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A powder-son?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A powder-son?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He said that you're a powder-son.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What's the difference?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's like a Kino Dokuya.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Which one is it?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But the Kino Dokuya is quite different.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The Sonia and Kino Dokuya are different.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Which one?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sonia.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So Kino Dokuya is...

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Your ad-lib?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's really harsh, to be honest.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you do your ad-lib, it's fine.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you don't admit it, you'll admit it sooner.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ad-lib?

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ad-lib is fine.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you do that, it's fine.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, yes.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Anyway, everyone.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Where?

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's close.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're waiting, right?

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, I'm waiting for Hama-san.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Please.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There's a connection, so I'll go with a

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you do that, you'll be in trouble.

40
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's right.

41
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Anyway, everyone.

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Where?

43
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's close.

44
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're waiting for me, right?

45
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, I'm waiting for you.

46
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Please.

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll take my jacket because there's a connection.

48
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here it is.

49
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What is this?

50
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What is this?

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What? Tajima?

52
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's over there.

53
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's over there.

54
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The place where the fire is burning?

55
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

56
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What?

57
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

58
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The fire is burning.

59
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's really scary.

60
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Kanuma-san, you can't go in.

61
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't go in.

62
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is this?

63
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's amazing.

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please wait here.

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The next episode will be sponsored by the following sponsors.

66
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Who is this?

67
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The war is over, and we are born again.

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Without knowing the war, we are born again.

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
After the war, we were born

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Without knowing the war, we grew up

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We became adults and started walking

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
While singing the song of peace

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want you to remember our names

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We are children who don't know war

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We are children who don't know war

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ah, that's why tonight I'll hold you in my arms

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ah, tomorrow and the day after

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I thought there was something to talk about.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I want to take you away with me, with my sleeping heart in my pocket

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So tonight, I'll hold you in my arms

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ah, tomorrow, right now, I'm in the train.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I want to hold you in my arms.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ah, tomorrow, right now, I'm in the train

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good evening. Thank you.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The name of the song is, I think it was 1970,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The Children Who Don't Know War, sung by Jiro's.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I remember I went to Osaka Banpaku in this era.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The second song is a song of Chulip in 1973.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's nostalgic.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How was it?

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's good, isn't it?

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is also good, isn't it?

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think so.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will introduce the members who will play with me today.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
First, the man who has loved guitar for 40 years and dedicated his life to the fork, Sugiyan!

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you for having me.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The fork is the best.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sugiyan is a gentle man who doesn't look good on his face, and is pure inside.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And, the man who is always a little bit silly, Robo-san!

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hello!

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah!

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right?

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You look good in it, Rob.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, you do.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
OK, the next song!

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes, please.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
My hair is growing on my shoulder

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Soon, forming the Vice President is as promised

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I will play in the city in the Provincial........

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In the same struggle, the guitar that Ink�� is which I'm an old Violon player

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
When you're done, let's go to the inn and get some flowers

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Spring is coming soon, so let's go for a walk in the flowers and the trees

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then you will open the window and show me

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
For my sake, I will come to take you away

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's kill you

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please, please

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mr. Kikuno

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's been a long time.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You guys are all together.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't know.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You guys are 9 years old.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Both of us went to Ushio Elementary School.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What were you doing, Endo?

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I didn't ask.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You didn't?

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't ask.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You guys don't remember when you were little?

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think it's not.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Excuse me, I'm going to change my clothes.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes?

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think I can get a haircut if I go home now.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, yes.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If you say something, I'll do something.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know what to do.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know what to do.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not that different.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's different?

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a little different.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm not a folk singer, but I'll sing a song that I wrote for everyone.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go!

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The bottom of the sea is the first time I've swum

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It feels so good

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My stomach is full of red bean paste

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The sea is wide and my heart is beating

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The peach-colored salmon waved its hand and was watching my swimming

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you, thank you

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I sang along with the children, so I would like to go back to my original self

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Now, let's listen to the medley.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
1, 2, 3, 4

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You are like lightning

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You tore my heart apart

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You shook my cold heart

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You took my eyes and broke them

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's live our lives

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
While listening to the distant miracle

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What should we do?

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:16,560
Very cute《Banman》

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:27,660
Suddenly, you came along with the ring and the

166
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,760
wooden sword

167
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
You carried Well

168
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Stand up with your feet again, and burn the flame of life

169
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:59,860
La il記得 l remember

170
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
sé fundo

171
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Alice

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,560
End

173
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,560
I think it was good.

174
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
I see.

175
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Let's move on to the next song.

176
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,080
English Mona MUDA

cafe

179
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:37,520
You once told me

180
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:32,740
I visited the經rais

181
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,160
I went with you

182
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:46,020
where there is sleep

183
00:12:46,020 --> 00:13:05,020
We promised to go together, but now it's not possible

184
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Misaki Megurino

185
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,020
Bus runs

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Deep sadness

189
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,020
If you sink in your heart

190
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,520
If you sink into your heart

191
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,020
After this journey

192
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,020
Go back to the town

193
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Together with everyone

194
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:52,020
The bus going around Misaki runs

195
00:13:52,020 --> 00:14:01,020
The blue sea spreads out in the window

196
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:10,020
If you can sink your sadness deep into your heart

197
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:20,020
Let's go back to the town after this journey.

198
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Thank you, thank you.

199
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,020
This is Yamato Kotaro's song, Weekend.

200
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,020
I remember this song.

201
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
I see.

202
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Yeah.

203
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
Right?

204
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,020
I wish you could sing with me.

205
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
Next time, I will.

206
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Really?

207
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
I see.

208
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
Then, the next number...

209
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Ah, how was the end?

210
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
Ah, I think it was good.

211
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Really?

212
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Yes.

213
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
You should have sung with me.

214
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
Yes.

215
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
Next time, next time.

216
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Okay.

217
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Then, let's go to the next number.

218
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
I forgot the lyrics.

219
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
But you should have repeated this part.

220
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
I did.

221
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
I was so nervous.

222
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

223
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
No, no, no.

224
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Hajime, no.

225
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
What is this?

226
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,020
What is this?

227
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
I'm so scared.

228
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,020
Are you mentally ready for this?

229
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,020
I don't know.

230
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
I'm not that kind of guy.

231
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,020
Oh, it was yesterday.

232
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Hitoshi is an Asian parion. Hamada is an Asian parion.

233
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
Hamada is...

234
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Ah! You're the one who's the fastest!

235
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Hitoshi is an Asian parion. Hamada is an Asian parion.

236
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
But as expected, Mama is...

237
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
What's the matter?

239
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Everyone's looking at you.

240
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,020
Ah, everyone's looking at me.

241
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
No, no.

242
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Are you saying something to the staff with your sleeves?

243
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
What?

244
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Are you saying something like, do something?

245
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
No, I'm not saying anything.

246
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I'm just asking for something.

247
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
What?

248
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Stop saying that!

249
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
You're destroying yourself!

250
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
You're asking the staff to do it!

251
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
You're doing it yourself behind the scenes!

252
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,020
What?

253
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
It's nothing!

254
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
I just asked for a favor.

255
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
You're so mean!

256
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
What?

257
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,020
You're like a behind the scenes video that only celebrities can watch!

258
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
You're the one who's being mean!

259
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,020
I'll take it!

260
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,020
I'm not angry or angry at you.

261
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,020
I have a little question.

262
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Do you have any employees at the convenience store?

263
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
One or two?

264
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
There are quite a few.

265
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
It's okay.

266
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Do you buy lunch or other ingredients?

267
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
I don't buy it.

268
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,020
You don't buy it.

269
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
Because there are stupid families at home.

270
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:35,400
Bring me a

271
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Bring the sheet of paper.

272
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I have one.

273
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
We sometimes buy things.

274
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Like some stuff.

275
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
You can make it.

276
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Who do I make it for?

277
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
I've made it twice today.

278
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I'll buy it.

279
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm not angry at all.

280
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
You do this.

281
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
You can do it, right?

282
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,400
You ask me if I can warm up, right?

283
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Well, well, you can't warm up, can you?

284
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,400
But I can't wait for the talent to warm up.

285
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
But that's a memory.

286
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
But I have it at home.

287
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't know where to eat it.

288
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm sorry in front of 7-Eleven.

289
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
It's not 7-Eleven.

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I don't know.

291
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Maybe there are days when you don't want to go home.

292
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
No, no, no. Who lives alone?

293
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Can you buy that?

294
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
I don't know. I don't know where to eat.

295
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I've never warmed up.

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I see.

297
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I got a little drunk on my way home from work.

298
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
I was doing this.

299
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Please do it.

300
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm a clerk.

301
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
You're a clerk.

302
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm a clerk.

303
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Do you want to warm up?

304
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
No, I'm fine.

305
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,400
I never say anything! I never say anything!

306
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I feel something like a thud.

307
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
You're not expressing it correctly.

308
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
If it's a thud, it's not good.

309
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
It's not a thud?

310
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
It's like, are you angry?

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
I never say a hundred percent!

312
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I don't know about that.

313
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,400
At that time, I felt really lonely.

314
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I was like, I can't warm up, so I'll cool down my heart too.

315
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Like that.

316
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
What was it? That leftover...

317
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
What was that? At any convenience store?

318
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Any convenience store...

319
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
That was just a coincidence, right?

320
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
No, no, no. How many times have I been to a convenience store?

321
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I don't know.

322
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,400
I couldn't warm up for thousands of times.

323
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Ah, even if you say it.

324
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I've said it many times.

325
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
It's strange, isn't it?

326
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It's from you.

327
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I just answered it, so let's answer it.

328
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
It's like that.

329
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
For example,

330
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Sensei, is my son okay?

331
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Say that.

332
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Hello, Hana-san.

333
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
The result came out.

334
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Doctor, is my son okay?

335
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
That's strange!

336
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
That's a wrong example!

337
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
That's strange!

338
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
No, no, no!

339
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
The result is out!

340
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I even went to the doctor and asked him!

341
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
And the doctor's face is like this!

342
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
What is it?

343
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Ah, ah, ah, I feel good!

344
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I feel good!

345
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Kama-san, please pinch my nipples!

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Hurry up and pinch my nipples!

347
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Your example is weird!

348
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
You're the only one who said to pinch!

349
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,400
If I pinch you, you'll say, ahhh!

350
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
But I'm doing that!

351
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Your example is weird!

352
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm doing that!

353
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Your example is weird!

354
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Really?

355
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,900
It's fine, we're doing well on this show, we just need to verify it.

356
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
We're going to every convenience store.

357
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,900
Yoshiko-chan was at home.

358
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,400
So, let's go look for Yoshiko-chan.

359
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,400
Yes.

360
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
The two of us.

361
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
You're here, I'm here.

362
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,900
Yoshiko-chan, let's go look for her.

363
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,400
And then, we meet here for a bit, and she's not here.

364
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
How was it there?

365
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Say it!

366
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
You can see the result!

367
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

368
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Why is it that only elementary school students carry a land cell?

369
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I understand.

370
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Did you carry a land cell?

371
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I didn't.

372
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
You're lying.

373
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
You didn't carry a land cell.

374
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I was in elementary school.

375
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,400
From the first grade, I was wearing a knapsack.

376
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
The string was like this.

377
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
From the first grade?

378
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I don't remember you teaching me how to do a round sale.

379
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
You were really wearing a knapsack.

380
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
With bare feet.

381
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Why bare feet?

382
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I didn't have to buy a knapsack.

383
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
You're a good guy.

384
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
But you really didn't do the land sale, did you?

385
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
No, I don't care about that.

386
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Well, no one is interested in your story.

387
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
No one is interested in your private life.

388
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
So, why is it that only elementary school students do it?

389
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Yes, yes, yes.

390
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
That is...

391
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
What?

392
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Why are you so quiet?

393
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
That is...

394
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Please think about it.

395
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
When you look at you,

396
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
you have a lot of things on your shoulders, right?

397
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I see.

398
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
What?

399
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,400
When you become an adult, you have to bear a lot of things, don't you?

400
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
But, being an adult is fine, right?

401
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
What are you talking about?

402
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
What is this?

403
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
What are you talking about?

404
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:21,400
When you become an adult, you have to have a shield called jealousy.

405
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,400
A brush box called a colleague.

406
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
That's a strange example.

407
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Eraser called wife.

408
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
What do you think of all this stuff?

409
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Don't you feel burdened?

410
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
But adults are fine, right?

411
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
We are like that now.

412
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
You guys are like that too.

413
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,400
If everyone is over 20, they will be carrying around a land cell.

414
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,400
They are carrying around something like that.

415
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,400
So, I thought it would be good to have something for the children.

416
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,400
That's how it started.

417
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Land Cell.

418
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
