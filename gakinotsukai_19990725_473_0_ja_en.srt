1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Every time we have a new member of the school, we will have a special 10th anniversary party!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have a new member of the school!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Say something!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm being rude!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're just a bad guy.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Say something!

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you doing?!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is this okay?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've been a Yakuza for 10 years.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, as a Yakuza,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'd like to have a skit with everyone today.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do it.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll take a picture of you.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I see.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I've never been a skit.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll do it because I'm bad at it.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're a skit.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You are a bad singer. You have never done live show, right?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So take off your hat!

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's why I'm doing it. Do you understand?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, yes!

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes!

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, yes!

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, yes!

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I want you to receive my painting lesson.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is a big deal. Why do you do it?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is my second time.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've done it twice.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you have a license?

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't need a license for scuba diving.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You do!

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't need it.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How about Tanaka?

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've done it three times.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're a real man.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're a real man.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Really?

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Where did you do it?

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I did it in Ishigaki Island.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, I did it in Austria.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Austria!

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Austria!

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're kidding me.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Austria is a mountain.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's Australia.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What are you doing?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This time, the place where the scuba will be held is the 5m deep pool at the Ok Marin Pro in Nerimaku.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As you can see, even in the teacher's Yamagaki, he has only dived twice.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is Hamada Endo's first time.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can they all take a photo of the sea?

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yamachan's Tsukiyama Koshu!

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, please.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll teach you properly.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's my first time, so if you teach me with money, I'll die.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you do it with half the fun.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll never do it with half the fun.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
First of all,

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's normal.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's normal.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not really half the fun.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
First of all,

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't lick the sea!

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm writing it in Akaji.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You must not lick it.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Normally...

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What did you say?

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You must not lick it.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's all I said.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey!

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can give it to him.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't laugh!

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm just saying the same thing over and over again.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you ready?

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please put it in the corner of your head.

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In the corner?

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to put it in the corner.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Akaji is the most important thing.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's okay. Just put it in the corner.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't lick your eyes. Next!

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
First, the mask.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The mask in the water.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll definitely wear the mask in the water.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And the regulator.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The mouth of the regulator is a tail.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A tail? What is a tail?

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's where you breathe.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's where you breathe.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the auxiliary air source.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is written as the source of air, and it's called the air source.

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, it's not like that.

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's not like that at all.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell me what it is.

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a special case.

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, I'll explain.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What is this?

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is the pressure gauge of the air pressure gauge.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is how much air is left.

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Next is basic knowledge of diving.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
First, knowledge to balance the pressure.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you remember the unpleasant feeling when you first learned it...

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is unpleasant feeling?

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Matsumoto-san, you have it, right?

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right now, it's a little unpleasant.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ear-pulling.

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please do ear-pulling.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you can't properly pull out your ear,

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the eardrum in your back...

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You'll break it!

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I won't explain about the technique anymore.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll teach you how to remove the ear.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please pinch the nose.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's the first time.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll never tell you.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's easy to break it.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, I do.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then, I'll put it on my mouth.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you put it in when you put it in?

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, I do.

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You put it in, but you put your nose in?

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, I always put my nose in.

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But your nose is like this.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, it's like a mask.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But the mask has a hole so that the nose can be pinched.

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, really?

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Did it have a hole?

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not a hole.

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Everyone is trying to figure it out.

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's from the top, right?

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If there's a hole, it's going to be a hole.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, it's a hole.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The mask has a hole to make it easier to pinch the nose.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How do you do it?

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Like this, and then, when you exhale,

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you face this way.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's hard to understand.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You face this way.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The earpick is used to push air out of the nose by pinching the nose and pinching the nose.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can also use it when you're on a plane and your ears are tingling.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you don't do this, the air will come out from your ears.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can't do this.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can't do this.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you can't do this, you can't go down.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't go down.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Please do it, Mr. Amada.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is also a challenge.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Next is the lungs.

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You go down like this.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And the bubbles that come up, if you go further than that, the lungs will burst.

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And you will get sick.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Really?

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If that's the case, I'll quit.

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You'll get sick.

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you go further than that, you'll get sick.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You'll get sick.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're saying it like you're sick.

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's called a water-sickness.

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really?

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a serious disease.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is very...

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's like this.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's like this.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's like this.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What? It's like this from here on?

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you suddenly rise, your lungs won't be able to withstand the change in pressure.

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't panic, slowly continue to rise while breathing.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Next is a hand signal that's important to protect yourself underwater.

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a trouble.

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is this.

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Matsumoto-san was like this.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He was like this in the drama.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Lastly, the question for Yamazaki-sensei.

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay, then.

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
End.

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Today is a poll, so it's like this.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If a shark comes out, what should we do?

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
When a shark comes out, you should definitely meet it.

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's true.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If it comes out, you should meet it.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you encounter a shark, don't panic and wait for it to pass by the nearby rock.

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What if you get your feet caught?

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When you get your feet caught, don't do it.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What if you get caught?

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What if you get caught?

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Take off your regulator, take off your fins, take off everything.

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're naked!

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right?

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Diving maturi!

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're the one who's scared.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We're going to practice in the pool.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're the opposite.

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Daki-san.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you okay?

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Daki-san.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ah, yes.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
First, we'll get used to the water.

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's something that can be taken very cleanly.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's amazing.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Amazing!

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go!

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why are you looking at me?

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're always there.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's with you? You're not even looking at me.

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Amazing!

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're always there.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you very much.

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll show you the secret of the secret.

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The next day

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh!

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You did it!

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Contact!

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is so much fun!

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's floating so much!

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I thought I could do it with this.

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What is this?

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It feels good!

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is so fun!

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is fun too!

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is fun!

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now, the important part, the ear-picking practice.

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go!

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please play the song!

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Please!

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Please!

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hurry up!

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know what you're doing.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It doesn't hurt yet, right?

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not good to do it like this.

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't do it.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I want to wear it more.

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's too deep.

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's too deep.

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm scared.

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I want to do it here.

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You lied.

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
My legs!

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And he wears the earthenware.

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll put the legs in.

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Wow!

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm so tired.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What should we do? Let's go.

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hamada, if you're free, let's go diving.

255
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to get stuck.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not going to let you go.

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hamada shows his high tension.

258
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Will he be able to finish the photo shoot smoothly?

259
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Alright!

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why are you laughing?

261
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're not a pro! What are you doing?

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm doing a butterfly knot.

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No way!

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A shoulder knot.

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Next, breathing training underwater.

267
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
From the top.

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Where?

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
From the bottom.

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is the first time for Hamada, a beginner.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can't do it!

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I can't do it here!

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
After a few practice sessions, Hamada is gradually getting used to the water.

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The other members are breathing through their noses.

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Up until now, it seems like everyone has been doing well in scuba diving.

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I feel like I'm the only one who's breathing heavily.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's because you're too much of a swimmer.

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Too much of a swimmer?

279
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think I'll be fine today.

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll change my swimming style here.

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes, yes.

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is this okay?

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's okay.

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, it's okay.

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's okay.

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Mr. Kawabata, are you okay?

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm okay.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay.

289
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes!

290
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, then.

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is, um,

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mr. Totsumon wants to learn how to do this.

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes.

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How to deal with the water when the mask is soaked.

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I see.

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes, please.

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
May I?

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Listen to me. Are you listening?

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes, I am.

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You are not listening.

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I am listening.

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I am listening.

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Are you okay?

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I feel like a city person.

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know.

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Are you okay?

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sometimes water comes into the mask.

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So, when you push here and look up and when water comes in, you say,

312
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Ha!

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Ha!

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Ha!

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do it.

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ha!

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Ha!

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can't hear you.

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You can't just say,

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Huuuwaaa!

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You have to stick it on.

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's try it.

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's try it.

325
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Put it in.

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's in.

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's scary, isn't it?

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's scary, isn't it?

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Wait, wait, wait.

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Ouch!

331
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a pervert!

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a pervert!

333
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a pervert!

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a pervert!

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And the way to deal with troubles underwater.

336
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Next, remove the regulator.

337
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What do you mean?

338
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Maybe you can remove the regulator.

339
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No, it's not like that. Do it properly.

340
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why can't I do it?

341
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Remove it.

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If you bump into it.

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you bump into it.

344
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then, the other regulator.

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There's another one.

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There is, right?

347
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Please give it to the person next to you.

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Eh, you remove it from the inside and it comes in with water.

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There's this button, right?

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

351
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Push it hard.

352
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then the air won't go in.

353
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

354
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What are you talking about?

355
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll kill you!

356
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to kill you!

357
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll kill you.

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The water won't go in.

359
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Ah, I see.

360
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't believe you can do such a good thing!

361
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let's try it.

362
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll do it.

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll push it.

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Really?

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Everyone is passing the regulator to the person next to them.

366
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Will he succeed?

367
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't make me laugh!

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please forgive me!

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's right!

370
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Listen to me! You don't talk to me at all!

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't talk to me at all!

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm doing this, but you don't talk to me at all!

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hamada is not doing well at all.

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He is being taught by everyone and he is challenging himself.

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You are breathing in slowly.

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You are breathing in?

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes.

378
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And then you add this and then you do this.

379
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Ready?

380
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You are weak.

381
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You are kind.

382
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Are you okay?

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay, I'm ready!

384
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

385
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I did it, right?

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I did it, I did it.

387
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay, good.

388
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
A commemorative photo of waiting.

389
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's go to the last gate.

390
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
As a commemoration of today, let's take a picture at the pool.

391
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's not there.

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No, no, no, let's take it there.

393
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is my ideal.

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, that's right.

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, I know it's bright, but the ideal is.

396
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is impossible.

397
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because I have a bench ready for you.

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, maybe, but I can't go that far.

399
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Dan-dan-san, please put it in the middle.

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Is this a goggles?

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do I take it off?

402
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes, you do.

403
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, it's red!

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This is the real one, but it's still red!

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a good thing that you're with Mr. Warakawa.

406
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you're the one who's going to be the one who's going to be finished,

407
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
it's going to be a mess.

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's dangerous.

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So, shall we start now?

410
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
First, for example, if something happens,

411
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
like if you get sick or get injured,

412
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the person on your side will be responsible for it,

413
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll make it my own fault.

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Please sign this.

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You're crazy.

416
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm the one who's to blame.

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This has nothing to do with me.

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You signed it, right?

419
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay, I signed it.

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

421
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So, 5 meters...

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you're 5 meters away, I'm telling you to blow your head off.

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Let's have two people take this.

424
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just the two of us?

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When?

426
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll take this off and leave it on after everyone takes it off.

427
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Just for you, Bantam?

428
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, for you, Bantam.

429
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is the pose.

430
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Ehh?

431
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Is it a pose for a comedy?

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
A pose for a comedy.

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is the 5-meter long drinking set.

434
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Each person will go down to this place.

435
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
First, Yamazaki.

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Good luck!

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Wow, he did it!

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He's going for the omega!

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Wow, I'm impressed.

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's a fool, he's not going to be hurt.

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm going to go.

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
How can you stand on the ground?

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you go down, you'll break.

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh, really?

445
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hurry up.

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Because he's a gay.

447
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm getting more and more confident.

449
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm going to go down.

450
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sure I'll explode again.

451
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's a shocking video.

452
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know. I'm so used to this TV program.

453
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can be careful.

454
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, that's it.

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

456
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm doing it for 10 years.

457
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll do my best.

458
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It was fun today.

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm doing it for 10 years on TV.

460
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes, it was really fun today.

461
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thank you very much.

462
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll prepare a meal for you later.

463
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll be a pervert.

464
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Can they take a commemorative photo at 5 meters?

465
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The two people left in the downtown.

466
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If you say you can't go to Hamada, I won't be there.

467
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go!

468
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Kamata failed.

474
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You should have put the end down.

475
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's hard.

476
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's hard.

477
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is nothing.

478
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go.

479
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a running town.

480
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There he is.

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He's going.

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't do it.

483
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
My ears hurt.

484
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can't do it.

485
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
My head is getting swollen.

486
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Failed again.

487
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll try it.

488
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll try it.

489
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
My head and ears hurt.

490
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm tired.

491
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Please take a deep breath.

492
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm going to be here all the time.

493
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I want to hear it loud and clear.

494
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Matsumoto fails too.

495
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He can't go down to the bottom.

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Here, Matsumoto will do a side challenge!

497
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Matsumoto has shown his hard work.

498
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's only one Hamada left.

499
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And the final challenge.

500
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Hamada is desperately trying to take a photo.

501
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The photo that will be a big hit will be announced later.

502
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Are you taking a photo?

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I didn't see it.

504
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The group has a pose, so it's hard to move.

505
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, I see.

506
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's like a finished product.

507
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's the 10th anniversary.

508
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's a beautiful photo.

509
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a good one.

510
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll keep it safe.

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I saw everyone from above.

512
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm counting on you.

513
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a photo that's a gift for the viewer.

514
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Of course.

515
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's a good one.

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I've been holding my nose all the time.

517
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The challenge that the always cowardly Downtown has done, which seems reckless

518
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Their courage has given us a sense of emotion

519
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Thank you, Downtown

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is a memorable scene

521
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And a splendid 2 shot of downtown!
