1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I want to know more about Ikko.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Quiz, about Ikko no 500.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No one said anything about wanting to know more about him.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Question 1.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That was fast!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ikko's last name is?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's close!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The answer is...

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ah, that's right.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The answer is...

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The answer is...

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kouda?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, the correct answer is...

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Toyota, Kazuyuki.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Toyota?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's really red.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Really.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My eyes hurt when I see you with red eyes.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like a snow mountain.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
By the way, everyone.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For this time, the 500 points of Ikko,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the person with the least correct answers will be left alone with Ikko.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The worst one is...

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You have to do your best.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was different before.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Question 2.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How old is Ikko?

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How old is that?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's definitely Ikko-san.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This much?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I think it's about this much.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Answer open.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think it's about the same age as Downtown-san.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a little older than Downtown-san.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think it's about 45

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think it's below

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now, the correct answer is...

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's coming, right?

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
45

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's just about the same

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is Ikko's favorite color?

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's annoying.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Open the microphone.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is...

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's just me.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The correct answer is...

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The pink rose is completely red.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's here.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's missing.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to say something, but I'm still not used to it.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not a word.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was a combination of the original.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ikko, when was the first time you fell in love?

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When I woke up.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not a question like this.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think it was when I woke up.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
5 points.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The answer is 5 points.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not a question like this.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's probably early.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, the correct answer is

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
First love?

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes!

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hamada-san is here

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's really good

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why is he so different?

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's better than Ikko

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you talking about?

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ikko's first love

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You?

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think I know that

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Please show your answer.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The answer is...

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Everyone chose a man.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I chose Kazuyoshi.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Tamori.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, the correct answer is...

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Izumi Seijirou.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't say it with your first name!

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What is the first thing a man checks?

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's about time you hit me

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know, I'm worried too

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He opens the answer

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm worried too, I'm at work

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm worried too

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, the correct answer is

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Body check?

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The part you like?

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The back

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
When I get questions like that, I get a lot of questions back

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to answer them

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Body?

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not that

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not that

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What country do you think Japan is?

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a country.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I see.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you go overseas...

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You'll know when you go overseas.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think it's a place that's not just beautiful.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, the correct answer is...

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hmm...

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Marjib.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The answer is...

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't understand.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't understand.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is the big L.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't understand this cycle.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The big L is coming out.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What do you think your self as a woman is?

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
As a woman?

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You mean I am?

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think this is about right.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, I think it's correct.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I still have a half chance.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's the best.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want to see more and more.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, the end is high.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then, the correct answer is...

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's your turn.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's this one.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You didn't make a mistake.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's high.

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's high.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's high.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's 120 points.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know it's not that high, right?

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You were just saying that, right?

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I see.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You have a lot to say.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I do.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What would you want to be if you were reborn?

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Something like this.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
5 minutes to the buzzer.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, really?

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well, well.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, finally, in my life, I feel like I was reborn.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I hated myself for being so complex.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was told I was like a woman.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I'm glad I was a good boy.

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's hit him.

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What is this?

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's like a sex scene.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's right.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But when it comes to men, it's a low-class.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
How many times do you forgive a kiss on a date?

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Kiss?

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know that.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't care.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I really don't care.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is pretty hard.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It looks like that.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What should I do?

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like a f***ing f***ing.

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, I'll go.

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're going to kiss, right?

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll go.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The first kiss.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In this case, isn't that what kissing is?

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Does it mean just kissing?

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's just kissing at first.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The correct answer is...

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh!

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Amazing

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's really...

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What do you mean by the eyes are the most important?

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who do you think is the most useless out of the 5?

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Here it comes

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is difficult

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Previously, the same question was asked about the quiz Hamada 500

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The 3 of them answered Tanaka

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What is this?

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And Hamada's answer is...

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Tanaka's answer is...

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Tanaka's answer is...

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I...

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,040
fries

191
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
car

192
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,940
you know my hairstyle is...

193
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,400
Tanaka-san

194
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't have that hair

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,660
I guess it

196
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,960
say it

197
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,960
say it

198
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm Sayaka

199
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,920
ah, realmente

200
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Akami-sama...

201
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Stop it, stop it!

202
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
It's just Akami.

203
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Middle...

204
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
No, no, no!

205
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
I think I got it right.

206
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
No, no, no!

207
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I thought it was the end.

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I was fishing and then I got it right.

209
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I found a underwear thief on the balcony.

210
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
How does the girl scream?

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm sorry. I forgot.

212
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
I still remember.

213
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I have to say this.

214
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
It's a betrayal.

215
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Now, the correct answer.

216
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Of course, don't mess with me.

217
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
What?

218
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
What is it?

219
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
What is it?

220
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
What is the first item?

221
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
I think this is a serious question.

222
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
That's right.

223
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Is it different?

224
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
It's like this.

225
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Kan-chan?

226
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Like this

227
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
It's different than that

228
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Is it different?

229
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
If it's different, it's still this

230
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
I think it's in the story mode

231
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
It's in the story mode

232
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
It's in the story mode?

233
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I'll make it a little more sharp

234
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I don't know what kind of face I'm making when I hear it

235
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
That's the most interesting

236
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Now, the announcement of the correct answer

237
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,920
He has become a family member.

238
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:46,920
When I woke up, I saw him and my mother and sisters having the same eyes.

239
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,920
I don't have anything to say but I have feelings for my family.

240
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
You got it.

241
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
You got it.

242
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
You got it right.

243
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
The pattern was perfect.

244
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
This is fun.

245
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
It comes out sometimes.

246
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
It's a good one.

247
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
What is Ikko's favorite weather?

248
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I'll go with this one.

249
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
It's the best.

250
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Ikko doesn't twist his neck here.

251
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
He doesn't twist his neck here.

252
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Really?

253
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
I don't twist my neck either.

254
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm a Mordivian.

255
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
The weather is good.

256
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Please announce the correct answer.

257
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Definitely sunny

258
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
It's a lie

259
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
It's a lie, Amano-san

260
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
It's sunny

261
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
From the start, after 3 hours, he's in trouble with his unrecognizable personality

262
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
It's a good thing

263
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
It's the flow of the ocean

264
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
It's the red ocean

265
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
It's the Atlantic

266
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
It's a good face

267
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,920
What is the most worrying thing in the world?

268
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Hmm... the most worrying thing in the world...

269
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Is this a pattern that we should talk about?

270
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
There is a possibility.

271
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
That time...

272
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I will definitely talk about this.

273
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
Now, the correct answer is...

274
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,920
It's the education problem.

275
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,920
There are many elementary and middle school students who are bullied by their teachers.

276
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,920
But teachers and parents are changing their minds.

277
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,920
When children see this, they lose their place to go.

278
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
They can't believe it.

279
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,920
So I think parents and teachers have to work together.

280
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,920
And also, how to save the students who have come this far.

281
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I think life is about the students who have come this far.

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,920
I always take care of them.

283
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
That's why it's about balance.

284
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
To achieve that balance, we need to educate them.

285
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
And all the things like talking.

286
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
It's all.

287
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,920
This is the first CD that Ikko bought.

288
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
This is the generation.

289
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
CD?

290
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
This is not a CD.

291
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Answer open.

292
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Bakugan Ranran.

293
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,920
This is a great answer.

294
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Now, the correct answer.

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Is this okay?

296
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
That's right.

297
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Why?

298
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
That's not it.

299
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
It's not that.

300
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Why did you write that?

301
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
That's right.

302
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,920
And I'm free to meet you again.

303
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I'll take it.

304
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,920
What is the switch that Ikko often presses?

305
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
This one?

306
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,920
I think it's the switch that he presses the most.

307
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
It's the last one.

308
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Right?

309
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Is it because there's no one who can play the guitar?

310
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
It's the second one.

311
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Secomu?

312
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Because it's a woman, it's really scary.

313
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Secomu?

314
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
It's strange to say, after all.

315
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
After all, it's Secomu.

316
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
It's a TV channel.

317
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Everyone is like that.

318
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
It's completely different.

319
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Which is more beautiful, bare-faced or naked?

320
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
This is difficult.

321
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
The body is...

322
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
You don't like it, right?

323
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
If it's a girl, I don't like it.

324
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
The correct answer is...

325
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
The more beautiful, bare-faced or naked?

326
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
I think it's naked.

327
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
What?

328
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
What is that?

329
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
There was only Yamazaki, Hadaka

330
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Wow, it's big

331
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
I want to take a picture of this

332
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Hadaka

333
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
It's completely left

334
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
It's left

335
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,920
If Ikko is a man, how old would you like him to be?

336
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
How old?

337
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
How old is the mother?

338
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
I see.

339
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I like the current me.

340
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Yes, you do.

341
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
That's right.

342
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
The answer is...

343
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Well...

344
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Now, she is 45 years old

345
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,920
As a woman, she is trying to be a great woman

346
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Her arms are getting thinner

347
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Her face is getting...

348
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,920
She is getting closer to her ideal

349
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
She is 45 years old

350
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm going to interview him.

351
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
I'm not going to say such a thing.

352
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Where was Ikko last Christmas?

353
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
I've been asked this question before.

354
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
But I think you were busy, so you had to do something.

355
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I don't know.

356
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
I don't know.

357
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Mic open.

358
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Well then.

359
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
I don't remember.

360
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
If it was two years ago, I was in Sabuto.

361
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
No, it's not.

362
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Last year, last year.

363
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
That was there.

364
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
That's what happened.

365
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Sometimes he would come out and say,

366
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
I refuse.

367
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I refuse.

368
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Even though he can do it, even though she can do it,

369
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
He's an old man.

370
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
He doesn't remember Christmas.

371
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
The 500th question.

372
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Alright.

373
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
The next question is,

374
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
How many times can you say,

375
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
From the beginning,

376
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
At 7 o'clock,

377
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
We finally reached the final question.

378
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Based on what we've learned so far,

379
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
The answer is...

380
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
It's definitely the line.

381
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
This is the easiest one.

382
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
This is definitely the answer.

383
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
It's meaningless if you don't see it.

384
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
It's a dead end.

385
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I don't like it.

386
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Now, the answer is...

387
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Well, it's not about money.

388
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I'll do it if you take the best pictures of me that have never been taken in Japan.

389
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
It's not a price.

390
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
It's not a price.

391
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
You said you'd do it.

392
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
It's the best.

393
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
It's the best.

394
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,920
If it's going to be like this, the best situation...

395
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
I'll do it.

396
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
It won't hurt.

397
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
It's shaking.

398
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I was right.

399
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Now, all 500 questions have been answered.

400
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Now, I will announce the winner of the quiz.

401
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
The winner is...

402
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Tanaka!

403
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
He's been called out.

404
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
He's been called out.

405
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Do you work here?

406
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
This is my first time.

407
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
What?

408
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
I've been here before.

409
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I've never seen you before.

410
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
This is my first time.

411
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I thought you'd be nice to me.

412
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I can't do 500 times.

413
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I thought you were a true man.

414
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
You were like that when you were in the old days.

415
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
I'll try to be a little stronger.

416
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll try to be a little stronger.

417
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
I'm sorry.

418
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Ouch!

419
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
My hip is so painful!

420
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I got a cramp.

421
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
It's okay, Tanaka.

422
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
I got a cramp.

423
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
It was dangerous, right?

424
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
This is a serious cramp.

425
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,920
