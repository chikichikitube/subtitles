00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,880
"The Quest".

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,440
Today's first segment is...

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,480
Daisuke Miyagawa's Way
to Japanese Festivals.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,960
One day...

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,720
Gosh, you startled me!

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,200
Mr Miyagawa,
the season of festivals has come.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,760
Did I imagine it?
Somehow you look smart now.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,800
Your vibes are a bit different.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,120
- Because I'm wearing black?
- Yeah, you look a bit fit.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,320
Because I'm wearing black.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I eat the same amount of food.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,920
- I binge eat.
- That means you eat a lot?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,840
Eat? Yeah, I think I eat
just as much.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,640
The stages this time

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,840
are Kagawa Prefecture
and Hyogo Prefecture.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,480
What's your impression
of Kagawa Prefecture?

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,920
Udon noodles.
The prefecture of udon.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,560
Udon?

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,600
Udon?

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,560
Is it udon?

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,960
From what we've been
talking about...

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, udon?

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,080
I can eat udon.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,000
I can eat 15 portions

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,720
if they're the wriggly ones
like Osaka's.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,560
I'll go to Kagawa Prefecture
and Hyogo Prefecture!

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,600
What festival is waiting ahead?

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,560
"This show was broadcast
9th of May, 2021"

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,320
Welcome to "The Quest".

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,840
Tonight, it's Daisuke Miyagawa's Way
to Japanese Festivals,

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,560
and Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,560
- Wasshoi!
- Hello!

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,560
Hello!

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Nice to meet you!

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,240
First,
it's Way to Japanese Festivals.

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,680
Filming this time
was really tough as well.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,120
He made it last for 30 minutes
only with a rock last time.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,240
It was worth watching.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,720
Many people said
they were impressed.

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,320
They went, "You can hold a rock up!"

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,080
"You can easily pick this up, then."

42
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,000
They went,
"You can pick this up, right?"

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
I see, you hold it like a pro.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
What?

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,040
This is Taga Hoop World Tournament!

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,440
All right!

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,960
"Daisuke Miyagawa's Way
to Japanese Festivals"

48
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,120
"Lotti Nakaoka's QTube"

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,960
"films funny videos in Okinawa"

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
Daisuke Miyagawa's Way
to Japanese Festivals.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,640
He came to Shodoshima Island,
Kagawa Prefecture.

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,600
Wasshoi!

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,080
The place I have come to

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,120
is Shodoshima Island,
Kagawa Prefecture!

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,040
- Look at this!
- Beautiful!

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
This is called Olive Beach.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,480
There are olive trees here,
that's Shodoshima Island for you!

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,120
Hey! Festival Guy
of Shodoshima Island!

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Bring it on!

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,880
Our guide is

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,800
the host of the tournament,
Mr Yasuo Yamamoto,

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,800
5th Generation owner
of Yamaroku Soy Sauce.

63
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,760
- You make soy sauce?
- Yes, we're a soy sauce brewery.

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,520
Is this a festival or a tournament?

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
- It's a tournament.
- Tournament!

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,720
Is it a dangerous tournament or not?

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,080
If you continue to break the record,
it might hurt a bit.

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,120
It'll hurt? Because of soy sauce?

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,280
Or hurt your back a bit.

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,160
- Hurt my back?
- Yes.

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
Red and swollen.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,920
- It'll be red and swollen?
- Yes.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,080
No! I don't want to be
red and swollen!

74
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,200
They go to the stage this time,
Yamaroku Soy Sauce.

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,360
Mr Miyagawa, have a look at that!

76
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
What?

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,200
What did Miyagawa see there?

78
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,200
It's a man spinning a huge hoop.

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,600
What? I see, it's that one!

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,000
The name of the tournament
is Taga Hoop World Tournament!

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,560
You say it with force.

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,360
Taga is the hoop that holds barrels
or tubs together.

83
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,000
People spin it and compete
for the number of spins

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
in the Taga Hoop World Tournament.

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,920
The first tournament was held
in 2015.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Participants come from
all over the world

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,920
and it's always lively,

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but it's cancelled this year
due to the pandemic.

89
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,120
Participants pray for it
to be held next year.

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,840
- People liken the hoop coming off
- Yes.

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,240
- to losing tension and relaxing.
- That's right.

92
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,920
It's that hoop.
The hoop comes off and it's broken.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,760
This is the wooden barrel
that matters most

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,160
in soy sauce making.

95
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,280
Impressive!
It's an amazing technique.

96
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
Why did you start it?

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,120
The wooden barrel is important
in soy sauce making,

98
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,280
but only one percent of soy sauce
is made in wooden barrels.

99
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,480
In 2009, only one company
still has crafters

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,960
who make wooden barrels,
so we ordered new barrels from them.

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,360
We were the first soy sauce brewery
that ordered new barrels after WWII.

102
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,760
It's because they can be used
for 100 years.

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,760
The next order would be placed
100 years later.

104
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,120
I see.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,560
The wooden barrel soy sauce making
on Shodoshima Island

106
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,080
has 400 years of history.

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
But it's costly, so the amount
produced reduces every year.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,000
At the same time, companies
that make big wooden barrels

109
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,800
are also forced
to close their business.

110
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,400
That wooden barrel company also said
they don't know when they'll close,

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
so I thought
we could make them ourselves.

112
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,560
Mr Yamamoto started a wooden barrel
crafter revival project in 2011.

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,600
He gathers soy sauce manufacturers
in Japan here annually

114
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
and teaches them
how to make wooden barrels.

115
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
When we were weaving the hoop,

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,840
I thought it'd be funny
to spin it like a hula hoop,

117
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
so I spun it.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,680
I thought it was quite fun,
so I made it a world tournament.

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,960
That's how it started.

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah, hula hoop is something
common globally.

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,480
- Right?
- Yes.

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
Now, he's going to practise.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,840
There's a square in another colour
in the middle,

124
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,640
you'll spin it inside.

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
- I lose if I go out?
- Yes.

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
What? Really? It's strict!

127
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,200
- You lose like this, too.
- No way!

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
It's too strict, Mr Yamamoto.

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,280
The referee will blow the whistle
and stop you.

130
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
This is a Taga Hoop

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,920
with a 1.8 metre diameter
for the prelims.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
The one used for
the world tournament is even bigger,

133
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,600
and its diameter is two metres.

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,080
Miyagawa will try it
using the 1.8-metre Taga Hoop.

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,560
- There's a secret to it, right?
- There is.

136
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,560
- Wait...
- What?

137
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,360
- No practise.
- What?

138
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
This is the tournament's rule.

139
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Seriously?
It's the real thing at once?

140
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
- Yes.
- Today?

141
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,520
But we have a special rule
starting from the last tournament.

142
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,640
Please tell me.

143
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,880
You pay 100 yen
to practise for one minute.

144
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
What?

145
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
- It's charged. Yes.
- I have to pay?

146
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,080
We don't have a fund
to run the tournament.

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,040
But if you think about things
like how it'll look on air,

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
I want to practise,
even if I have to pay.

149
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
100 yen per minute.

150
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,440
- 10,000 yen for 100 minutes?
- Yes.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Expensive!

152
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
Are you kidding me?
100 yen per minute?

153
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,640
- 100 yen per minute.
- Indeed.

154
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,800
What rule is that?

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,680
- Will you practise?
- Yes.

156
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,000
Of course.

157
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,080
Please put 100 yen in here.

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,920
- It starts counting at that moment.
- No way!

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,840
Start.

160
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,320
- Practise starts.
- Hurry up!

161
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,800
It's like this? And...

162
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,360
Can Miyagawa do it?

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
He's good...

164
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
You're very good at it.

165
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,560
Despite looking bad,
Miyagawa is spinning the hoop.

166
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,800
But...

167
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,760
He's out!

168
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,400
- What? One minute is over?
- It was close.

169
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,400
It's fine, one minute.
It's okay now, right?

170
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,560
This isn't a tournament.

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,080
He's good at it...

172
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,640
But it drags you quite a bit.

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,160
- Oh, I get it.
- 30 seconds left.

174
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,640
Actually, Miyagawa's potential
is quite good.

175
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,680
Most people can't spin it once

176
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,520
when they spin it
for the first time.

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
I get the gist of it now!

178
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,800
- I can get it done with 100 yen!
- You can.

179
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,960
I can do it! With 100 yen!

180
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,520
I can do it with 100 yen!

181
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
15 seconds left.

182
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,640
I can do it!

183
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,640
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

184
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,680
five, four, three, two, one. Finish!

185
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,400
Till it falls...

186
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,800
Let me do it till it falls!
I can't practise!

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,200
If I only think about money,
I can't practise!

188
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,200
Then the weather got worse.

189
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
They go to the brewery
where soy sauce is made.

190
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm coming in.

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,480
It smells very nice
even when I'm wearing a mask.

192
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,320
It's unrefined soy sauce.

193
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,640
Look at this wooden barrel.
The history.

194
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
It's amazing.

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
The wooden barrels
at Yamaroku Soy Sauce

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
are about 150 years old.

197
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,520
The barrels have live bacteria
called the Brewery's Treasure,

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,520
and they vary
from brewery to brewery.

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,520
That's why each shop
makes its unique soy sauce.

200
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,240
It has no additives and is made
in the traditional way. I'll try it.

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,600
- Looks delicious.
- Wow, it's delicious!

202
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
The echo came too soon.

203
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,360
Ordinary soy sauce
leaves a salty taste,

204
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,840
but this one leaves an aroma
and sweetness.

205
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,800
Sweetness exploded in my mouth.

206
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,160
Mr Yamamoto,
are you going to cook later?

207
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,320
- I'll cook.
- No, it's "Dining Al Fresco".

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,880
I thought I could eat udon
with egg and soy sauce, but no!

209
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
It's Taga Hoop World Tournament!

210
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,280
We have raw egg on rice
and grilled rice cake, though.

211
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,720
I want some.

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Today's featured dish
is raw egg on rice.

213
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,520
- Break the yolk.
- It has to be good!

214
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,680
- It has to be good!
- I'll try it.

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,280
- It's irresistible.
- I'm jealous.

216
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Oh, delicious!

217
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
What's this?

218
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,240
It's nice and aromatic,
and sweetness comes afterwards.

219
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
The soy sauce is rich,
but the taste is light.

220
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Mr Miyagawa, please practise.

221
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,120
It costs 100 yen per minute.

222
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,680
If it costs 100 yen per minute,
I'll do it in the tournament.

223
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,480
I'll use the 500 yen I saved
to buy this!

224
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Indeed.

225
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,080
The rain stopped,
so practise starts again.

226
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
The world record.

227
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,840
Tell me how many times it was spun.

228
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,440
It was 400.9 times.

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,920
400?

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,760
400?

231
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,160
The 10th place spun 52.8 times.

232
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,360
- 10th?
- Yes.

233
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,960
What? I might be able to beat it.

234
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,560
He has a look at the world ranking.

235
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
And then...

236
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,080
The sixth place...

237
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
There's a name you know, right?

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,280
It's Kaneko!

239
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,320
- Kaneko spun it 209 times?
- Yes.

240
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,280
When Oceans Kaneko appeared
in a breakfast show,

241
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
he made a record
of spinning 209.6 times.

242
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
I can't let him beat me.

243
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
Miyagawa's soul of festival
is fired up.

244
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,040
He put in 100 yen readily.

245
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,840
I did it with this power just now.

246
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
It's impressive enough.

247
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
It isn't stable.

248
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,040
It's not by momentum.

249
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,440
But...

250
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,600
Oh, I spun it too high.

251
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, my neck!

252
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,840
He came out. It's strict!

253
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,600
He pays more!

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,440
- It's difficult.
- You can do it!

255
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
What should I do?

256
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,000
That costs me about 20 yen!

257
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,320
The time of the decisive battle
has arrived.

258
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,440
- Can we ask for the champion?
- Champion.

259
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,160
Please do it.

260
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,560
Let's ask him here.

261
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,520
- This is the champion, Mr Inose.
- He comes out of the brewery.

262
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,080
So cool!

263
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,240
Is that the trophy?

264
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
Somehow he looks strong!

265
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,320
This is the Taga Hoop
World Champion,

266
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,320
Tomoya Inose.

267
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,560
This man spun the 13-kilogram
Taga Hoop 400 times.

268
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
He is at the top of his game
with his overwhelming power.

269
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,440
When was the first time
you participated?

270
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,960
It was in 2017.

271
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,400
- 2017.
- Yes.

272
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,800
Why did you participate?

273
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,880
I also wanted to spread the culture
of barrel making,

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,720
so I wanted to participate
in the Taga Hoop Tournament.

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
How confident are you?

276
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
I want to defeat you!

277
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,160
I will go all out.

278
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,560
Champion, would you be my opponent?

279
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,400
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

280
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,760
Let's begin!

281
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,240
Taga Hoop World Tournament
Special Version starts now!

282
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,640
Held at Yamaroku Soy Sauce,

283
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Taga Hoop World Tournament
Special Version has started.

284
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,560
Let me tell you the rules.

285
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,760
They'll compete
for the number of times

286
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,000
they spin the huge Taga Hoop.

287
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,000
But if the hoop touches the ground

288
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,600
or if their foot goes out
of the designated mat, it's over.

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Five judges will measure the record,

290
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,160
their average number
will be the official record.

291
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,640
If Miyagawa wins,

292
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,480
the Legend Apron
given to the three-time champion

293
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,920
will be given to him this time
as a special case.

294
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,400
If the champion wins,

295
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
we'll give him a happi coat
with Miyagawa's autograph.

296
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,960
- Champion will go first.
- Champion.

297
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,520
- How will the battle go?
- It's thicker than just now.

298
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,920
Look at Miyagawa's
facial expression.

299
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,360
The moment of anxiety.

300
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Now, the fateful match...

301
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,800
starts! Champion is spinning it!

302
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh, the whistle is blown!

303
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,000
The whistle is blown!

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,280
Why?

305
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,640
Champion made a regrettable mistake!

306
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Did that actually happen?

307
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,360
- Come on, champion!
- We'll watch in slow motion.

308
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,120
At the first spin, when the champion
started spinning the hoop...

309
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,920
The hoop touched the ground here!

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,680
Oh, it touched the ground.

311
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,280
What's the record?

312
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
1.1 times.

313
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Oh, my goodness! 1.1 times!

314
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,800
Sorry, let me ask.

315
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,320
Are you really the champion?

316
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,920
Aggressive.

317
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
Okay, here goes!

318
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Now, it's our Festival Guy,
Miyagawa's turn!

319
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
He'll win if he spins it twice,

320
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,480
but he aims to break
the world record, 401 times!

321
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,360
He picks up the Taga Hoop.

322
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,320
You can do it.

323
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,880
How is it going to end?

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
- Do your best!
- Approach run...

325
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,240
Now...

326
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,160
Start!

327
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,560
Miyagawa is spinning
the Taga Hoop stably.

328
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,840
It has already passed
the champion's 1.1 times!

329
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,440
He first aims to exceed
the 10th place

330
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,600
in world ranking, 52.8 times!

331
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,560
- Nice!
- It's stable.

332
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,840
He's spinning it well,

333
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,840
now it only depends on how much
his body can stand the damage.

334
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,920
It's going to be over 50 times soon!

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,960
He probably will rank the Top 10
in the world!

336
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,200
Exceeded 50 times.

337
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,160
Miyagawa spun over 50 times!

338
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
It's certain he'll be one
of the world's Top 10!

339
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
How much further can he go?

340
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
It must be tough.

341
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,040
Miyagawa said,

342
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,200
"One must remove the restraint
that suppresses one's limit to win."

343
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,560
Well said!

344
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,680
Oh, what happened?
The Taga Hoop is tilted!

345
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,000
But Miyagawa spun it back
to the original position!

346
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,960
This is Festival Guy
Daisuke Miyagawa!

347
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,960
Go!

348
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,680
- It has reached 100 times!
- Amazing!

349
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,920
He aims to break the world record!

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The champion...

351
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,960
He will reach Kaneko's record
209.6 times soon, too!

352
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,160
- You can do it!
- We hope he'll continue!

353
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
Watch out...

354
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
Oh, the rhythm of spinning
is disturbed!

355
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,920
Can he hold out?

356
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
- He did! He survived!
- Watch out!

357
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,200
But it isn't stable yet. Hold out!

358
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,800
Oh, the whistle is blown!

359
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
It's over for Miyagawa now.

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,000
- You did very well.
- That was beautiful.

361
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,040
He spun the Taga Hoop beautifully!

362
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,720
I could've done more!

363
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
I could've done more!

364
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,040
What's his record?

365
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,480
It's 135.3 times.

366
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,600
135.3 times!

367
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
"Record, 135.3 times"

368
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,440
What about the ranking?

369
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
You're in the eighth place
in the world ranking.

370
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,160
- Yay!
- Amazing!

371
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,600
He is in the eighth place
in the world ranking!

372
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
But may I say something?

373
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
- Champion.
- Yes?

374
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,480
- Would you try once more?
- Please let me.

375
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
Please show us your technique
and exceed your 400 times.

376
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
Okay.

377
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
- Thank you.
- Okay.

378
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
1,000 yen per spin!

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,120
But this man
will make an extraordinary record.

380
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
Wow, oh, my goodness!

381
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,520
The champion is approaching
the world record 400 times!

382
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,280
Will the champion be able
to build a new pyramid?

383
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,120
That's a champion!

384
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,080
Do your best!

385
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,400
It's coming! 398, 399, 400!

386
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,640
It's over 400 times,
he broke the record!

387
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,080
Amazing!

388
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Oh, did he relax?
The balance is off!

389
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,240
Spin it up!

390
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,360
- You can do it!
- Okay!

391
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
He held out!

392
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,320
He's exceeded the limit
of his stamina!

393
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,680
This way... Okay! Spin it up!
Spin it up!

394
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,640
Spin it up! Spin it up!

395
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,360
Spin it up! Okay, it's back!

396
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,440
The champion is incredible!

397
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,760
Twelve minutes after it started...

398
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,760
Mr Inose makes his own
carrot juice every day...

399
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,120
The hoop touched the ground!

400
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Wow, impressive!

401
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,080
The champion demonstrated
his overwhelming strength!

402
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
- Amazing.
- What's the record?

403
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
714.5.

404
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,760
He spun an unprecedented
714.5 times!

405
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,640
He made a brilliant record!

406
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,360
How do you feel, champion?
It's the world's new record.

407
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,480
- Thanks to you.
- No.

408
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,880
You showed us something incredible.

409
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,800
Thanks for giving me a chance.

410
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,600
You aren't the guy
who spun once at first.

411
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,680
What makes this tournament
attractive?

412
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,800
I want to let the next generation
know about the wooden barrels,

413
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,840
and the hoops used for them.

414
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,800
I hope they will be passed down
for generations.

415
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,440
- It was wonderful. Thank you!
- Thank you.

416
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,680
We pray that the Taga Hoop
World Tournament

417
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,560
will be held again someday.

418
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,280
The next place he goes to is...

419
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,680
Wasshoi!

420
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,400
The place I have come to

421
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,400
is Shinonsen Town, Hyogo Prefecture!

422
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,440
Hyogo's Festival Guys!

423
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,160
Bring it on!

424
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,880
Our guide is an officer
at Shinonsen Town's town office,

425
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,600
Ms Taniguchi.

426
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,200
How long is the history
of the festival?

427
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,560
As a festival, it started in 1998,

428
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,520
the main event, that is,
the championship,

429
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,360
is held the seventh time.

430
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,160
Championship?

431
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,240
They go to the stage of the battle,
Hamasaka Port.

432
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,520
Mr Daisuke,

433
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
have a look at that!

434
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,680
What?

435
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
What did Miyagawa see there?

436
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,280
It's men shovelling something
into their mouths.

437
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,200
They're firefly squids.

438
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,360
It's the Japan
Wankohotaru Championship.

439
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,800
What?

440
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
In the Japan
Wankohotaru Championship,

441
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,040
participants must eat firefly squids
like Wanko Soba in two minutes,

442
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
and they compete
for the number they've eaten.

443
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,720
At the Hamasaka Port,

444
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,720
the peak of the firefly squid season
is from January to May.

445
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,120
About 1,900 tonnes of firefly squids
are caught annually.

446
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Have a look at this!

447
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,000
They were boiled,
and they taste the best!

448
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
- May I try it?
- Yes, go ahead.

449
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,720
There are 10 squids in one bowl,
the weight is about 30 grams.

450
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
- It's a lot.
- One person can't eat 10!

451
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,920
Oh, delicious!

452
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,360
It's like sausages from the sea.
They're fleshy.

453
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,080
The liver inside
is absolutely delicious!

454
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,720
I can eat 500!

455
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,400
There are eight squids here.
How does it feel?

456
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,160
I'll try it once.

457
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,400
What does Miyagawa think?

458
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,760
He swallowed.

459
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,680
- How was it?
- No harm.

460
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,640
I can do it.

461
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,240
I really can.

462
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,840
- Will you practise once more?
- No.

463
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,120
Why did I eat 20 to practise?

464
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,240
I want to save it
till the real thing.

465
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,720
Can I try it
with vinegared miso, too?

466
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,760
Like this, right? And...

467
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
- He won't change the flavour?
- Like this, right?

468
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
How is it with vinegared miso?

469
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,280
What about vinegared miso?

470
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,760
You'd better not eat too much.

471
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,960
- He swallowed!
- It's quick!

472
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,840
He ate them at once.

473
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,880
You get the gist of it.

474
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,800
- Delicious.
- Stop it.

475
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,920
But it depends on how fast
the champion eats,

476
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,960
their body shape,

477
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,000
and how strong their throat is.

478
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
Keep watching this!

479
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,280
I might be able to win!

480
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
The time for the decisive battle.

481
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,680
Let's ask him to come.

482
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,000
- Already?
- At once.

483
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
This is the champion, Sumiyoshi!

484
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
- This person?
- A woman?

485
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,680
Oh, I see.

486
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,840
Wow, he looks like an athlete.

487
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,640
This man ate 207 firefly squids
in two minutes,

488
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,240
he is the absolute champion,
Takayuki Sumiyoshi.

489
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

490
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,800
Have you always been a big eater?

491
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
No, not a big eater,
it's only the speed.

492
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,560
I think the power of the throat
is the key.

493
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,600
- Yes.
- The power to swallow.

494
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,040
Just once...

495
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,040
Would you swallow once to show us?

496
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,920
It looks strong!

497
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,640
Let's begin.

498
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,560
Japan Wankohotaru Championship
Special Version starts now.

499
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,760
Japan Wankohotaru Championship
Special Version has started.

500
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,520
There are 10 firefly squids
in one bowl,

501
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,240
they'll compete for the number
of squids they eat in two minutes.

502
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,480
The squids are seasoned with ponzu
or vinegared miso.

503
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,400
If Miyagawa wins,

504
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,160
he'll be given Hamasaka's
most expensive brand snow crab.

505
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,360
Soon, the battle will begin.

506
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,760
- I can't wait.
- Miyagawa's facial expression.

507
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,760
What does that mean?

508
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,920
It's been a while.

509
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,200
This is fun!

510
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,880
Oh, Miyagawa doesn't look right.

511
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,200
It's been a while.

512
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,960
He feels emotional
on the stage of speed eating.

513
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,320
Before he fills his stomach
with firefly squid,

514
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,240
his chest is full of emotion.

515
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,600
- Okay!
- Miyagawa is fired up!

516
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,240
The match will be two minutes.

517
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,720
- Now, the fateful match!
- Go!

518
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
Start!

519
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,080
Both of them bolt down the squids!

520
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,560
- It's fast...
- It's fast!

521
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,000
They eat the second bowl in no time!

522
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,800
- It's fast!
- Oh, Miyagawa, be careful!

523
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,320
- It's too fast.
- That was close! He held out!

524
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,160
He stares at one point already!

525
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,480
On the other hand,
the champion isn't stopping!

526
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,160
He's already eating the fifth bowl!

527
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,080
Miyagawa will catch up now!

528
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,320
Can he swallow these 10 squids?

529
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,240
He can't swallow! It's dangerous!
He looks up!

530
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,920
He swallowed them!

531
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,080
But his fighting spirit
is still there!

532
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,440
But the champion doesn't slow down!

533
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,160
All right!

534
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Miyagawa is catching up
at high speed!

535
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,360
Oh, the champion seems to be
eating slower now!

536
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,480
You can do it!

537
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,120
And Miyagawa-- Oh, be careful!

538
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,680
He barely took the critical hit!

539
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,320
He held out somehow.

540
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,480
You can do it!

541
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,080
Miyagawa said he wouldn't end it
with glitter and sparkles.

542
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,720
Oh, what happened?
Squids are coming out? Be careful!

543
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,000
The squids...

544
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,600
He swallowed them back!

545
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,640
He held out!

546
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,040
Thirty seconds left!

547
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Will the champion win?

548
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,120
Or Miyagawa?

549
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,640
Oh, the squid's tentacles stick out!

550
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,480
Can he swallow it?

551
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,880
- Can he?
- The music is dangerous.

552
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,920
He swallowed it!
Okay, the last spurt!

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Miyagawa bolts down the squids
all at once!

554
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,320
It's dangerous.

555
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
Five seconds left!

556
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,800
Miyagawa is eating till it ends.

557
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,360
- It's over!
- He did his best!

558
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,280
Miyagawa is stupefied.

559
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm off my game.

560
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,280
I'm off my game.

561
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,960
My throat got weaker.

562
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,840
It's different
from when I practised.

563
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,560
Somehow I was nervous.

564
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,560
My stomach shrunk
and it surprised me.

565
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,400
I've been wanting to spit them out
starting from the second bowl.

566
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,400
What's the result?

567
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,120
108.

568
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,320
Miyagawa ate 108 squids.

569
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,440
The champion's record is...

570
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,160
176.

571
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,920
The champion ate 176 squids!

572
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,040
The champion won!

573
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,000
What's the reason of his defeat
this time?

574
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,840
What is it?

575
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,560
The tentacles got me.

576
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,360
It nearly triggered the gag reflex,
I thought, "Oh, no!"

577
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,320
I was fighting it.

578
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,480
But I just ate half of the squids
put inside at a time.

579
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,160
This...

580
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,000
Do this, look.

581
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,840
- He swallows...
- Swallows?

582
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,360
I can't do it.

583
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,520
That's all for
Way to Japanese Festivals.

584
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,320
That was fantastic!

585
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,720
It doesn't matter how many you ate.

586
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,280
- The number doesn't matter.
- It doesn't.

587
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
It was so funny!

588
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,480
A lot of firefly squids.

589
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,160
Over 30 bowls, it went like this.

590
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
It's dangerous. Is it okay?

591
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
The familiar face is back.

592
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,320
- 108.
- I ate 108.

593
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,120
- The number of worldly desires.
- Yes, but I swallowed them.

594
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
People will talk again.

595
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,160
"It's a lot of firefly squids."

596
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,360
"You ate a lot of that."

597
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,960
QTube.

598
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,760
Did Lotti Nakaoka come to Okinawa?

599
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
He finally came?

600
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,840
That's right!

601
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,200
- Chatan?
- You figured out.

602
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,560
Lotti Nakaoka has come
to Chatan, Okinawa!

603
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,720
First, it's a prank video
as warm-up.

604
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,080
Upside-down mug.

605
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,240
We tell Nakaoka

606
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,040
it's a video to upload
to the show's Twitter account.

607
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,560
Put the cup next to your face.

608
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,200
- Like the mug is big?
- Yes.

609
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,720
The content is steaming hot coffee.

610
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
It's covered with a coaster,

611
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,840
the content will spill
if he takes it up.

612
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,840
Nakaoka, upside-down mug.

613
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,080
Wow, it's full.

614
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,400
Let's put it next to my face first.

615
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,360
- Here I go.
- He's totally deceived.

616
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,440
Something unexpected happened.

617
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,600
- It's stuck there.
- Does my face look small?

618
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Amazing!

619
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,160
Whoa, it startled me!

620
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,120
- What's going on?
- Amazing.

621
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,600
- It's hot!
- It's late.

622
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,240
It's unusual to be surprised
by something so simple.

623
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,840
I thought the bottom fell off.
I thought the bottom was gone.

624
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,240
Next, it's a silly video.

625
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Can he eat a raw egg in a bucket
filled with water?

626
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,240
It's dangerous. This is dangerous.

627
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,080
- Nakaoka, Egg in Water Challenge.
- You shouldn't do this.

628
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,200
First, pour water
into a specially made bucket.

629
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,160
I'll pour.

630
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,320
Sorry, the timing is wrong. Sorry.

631
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,600
When you said "pour",
I wanted to breathe air in.

632
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,280
The one last breath.

633
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,560
Pour after I regulate my breathing
and raise my hand.

634
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,520
- He looks like this?
- He tries again.

635
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,720
- He does it after a deep breath.
- I like that face.

636
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,760
It's funny already.

637
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,520
So cute! He looks like a baby!

638
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
- It's here, Sochan!
- You can do it!

639
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
Only the string went there.

640
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,160
Be careful!

641
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
I feel sick!

642
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,280
I took a deep breath, right?

643
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
I have to drink water
after I breathe in,

644
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,480
I can't do it.

645
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,160
That was a blind spot.

646
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,560
In that case,
do it after he breathes out.

647
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
- I see.
- Yeah.

648
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,160
Will he make it?

649
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,640
- Wow.
- He's calm.

650
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,200
- Good, he's calm.
- Oh, it's the wrong place.

651
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,920
The side...

652
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,040
The side...

653
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,480
- The side...
- I feel sorry for him.

654
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
The side...

655
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,320
The egg came, but he sucked the most
unwanted part of the white.

656
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,240
- That was genius!
- Thank you. Glad to hear that.

657
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,200
I saw someone who looked twice
in water the first time.

658
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,840
The egg yolk here,
you looked at the yolk here once.

659
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,240
Next, it's a video of an experiment
using sounds.

660
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,640
We have the help

661
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,360
of Mr Tenjiro's pupil, Mr Ebitani.

662
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,320
We connected an amplifier
to a speaker,

663
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,280
and put an iron plate
on the speaker.

664
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,360
Sprinkle table salt
on the iron plate,

665
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,400
and when we play a sound
on the speaker...

666
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,400
Amazing.

667
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,560
What...

668
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,240
What's this shape?

669
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,400
It is called a Chladni figure,

670
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,760
salt grains are repelled at places
with strong vibrations of sound.

671
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,960
They gather where vibrations
are weak and they form a pattern.

672
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,440
Interesting.

673
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,200
Patterns vary
according to frequency.

674
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,880
We'll do an experiment to see if
it can be done with Nakaoka's voice.

675
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,000
Not all sounds can make it
form a pattern.

676
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,920
Oh, really?

677
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,120
Patterns only form when the sound
is at a certain pitch.

678
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,920
Which singer can do it?

679
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Someone like Mr Mera.

680
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,440
Mr Mera?

681
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,800
He tries with Mr Mera's voice.

682
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,720
Why did you choose "ke"?

683
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,360
It's blurred,
but a pattern is formed.

684
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,000
We recruited help to assist Nakaoka
stabilise his voice.

685
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,200
This is opera singer Mr Hibiki Kina.

686
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,440
It feels great!

687
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,600
Amazing!

688
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,040
I know how amazing it is even more
when I hear it live.

689
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,160
As a matter of fact,

690
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,800
Nakaoka has been saying he wants
to make opera singing a hobby.

691
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,960
He spent two whole hours
singing "Symphony No 9".

692
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,760
- Your voice is louder.
- Yes.

693
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,080
Now, the main topic.

694
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,360
Can Nakaoka's voice
make the salt form a pattern?

695
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Do your best.

696
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,320
Nakaoka will sing "Symphony No 9"
as he wishes,

697
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,600
and tries by extending
the last note.

698
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,640
"Can Nakaoka's voice
make the salt form a pattern?"

699
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
What's this?

700
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,760
- What?
- Oops.

701
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,440
- No reaction.
- Oh, no.

702
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,360
Oh, something appeared.

703
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,680
- Nice!
- Oh, it's pretty!

704
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,000
It formed a shape
I haven't seen before.

705
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
It formed a beautiful pattern.

706
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,480
It formed a pattern!

707
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,120
I've been doing QTube
for seven years,

708
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,960
I've enjoyed this time the most.

709
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,680
Next, it's the world's
amazing technique video.

710
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,760
Climb on top of a huge balance ball
and do a forward roll.

711
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,240
It's so scary!

712
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,080
This time, he'll do it
on Okinawa's red clay soil.

713
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,880
It gets sticky
when it contains moisture,

714
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,880
so it's an outstanding cushion.

715
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,320
I might make it at once.

716
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,080
It might not be the muddy scene
you want to see.

717
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,920
Nakaoka, forward roll
on balance ball.

718
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
Will he make it in one go
as he claimed?

719
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,600
- Be careful of your neck.
- Wait.

720
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
It's impressive.

721
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,120
Stabilise...

722
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,120
The balance ball
isn't stable at all.

723
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,160
Stabilise!

724
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,840
- Stabilise!
- Be careful.

725
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,480
That's all.

726
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,240
It's not funny at all.

727
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,680
Nakaoka can't even balance
on the ball.

728
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,760
"The 5th time"

729
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,520
I can't do anything!

730
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,600
And the 21st time.

731
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Thunder suddenly cracked.

732
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,080
Considering his safety,
this is the last chance.

733
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,720
- Is this Nakaoka?
- Ready, go.

734
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,800
What?

735
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,720
- It's so sad.
- Please let me off the hook.

736
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,600
Lightning is dangerous.

737
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,200
- It is.
- Let's go.

738
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,200
Okay, let's go.

739
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,480
Let's go.

740
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,520
Tidy up the place, guys.
Leave me alone.

741
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,800
The thunder won't realise I'm here,
it'll think I'm mud.

742
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,680
It's the regular video selfie
produced and directed by Nakaoka.

743
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,960
I love this segment.

744
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,200
"Most comfortable and laughable,
Sofas"

745
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,240
Good.

746
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,560
Hello, we are Sofas.
Nice to meet you.

747
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,520
My partner, Sofa, looks like
he's been turned upside-down.

748
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,920
I went to play golf the other day,

749
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,640
someone asked if I was Sofa,
and I said yes.

750
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,880
I hit the golf ball,
it flew to the other side.

751
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,360
The caddy said, "So far!"

752
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
What the heck?

753
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,200
Thank you.

754
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,520
Zipline Nakaoka.

755
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,760
Wow, I'm scared, but it's fun!

756
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,080
Many staff members drew pictures
of Zipline Nakaoka for me.

757
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,560
Look.

758
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,400
This one, this one...
They are all Nakaoka.

759
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,520
I'm going to fire the person
who drew this.

760
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,320
Lastly, it's Captaincy Nakaoka.

761
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,480
This time, we'll work
with a girls' handball team.

762
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,440
Really?

763
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,480
We came to Okinawa Naha Nishi
Prefectural High School.

764
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,880
The handball powerhouse was
in the third place in the Nationals.

765
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,080
Who is your captain?

766
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,240
Captain, you have
a new captain today.

767
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,560
All right!

768
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,840
Hey!

769
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,680
I'm your new captain!

770
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,160
Who did you think would come?

771
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,120
- Yamapi.
- Yamapi?

772
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,000
What a shame, it's Nakapi.

773
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,200
What a shame.

774
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,640
They'll try to play "Symphony No 9"
by handball's jump shot,

775
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
like in this video.

776
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
"Nakaoka and girls' handball team
collaboration video"

777
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,880
This time,
they'll play it using bells

778
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,520
on a pole specially made
by our show.

779
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,760
Amazing!

780
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,760
The first half will be filmed
in several small segments.

781
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,240
The second half will be uncut,

782
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,000
they'll aim to hit 32 notes
consecutively.

783
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,000
It's a very difficult challenge.

784
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,200
First, they'll film the first half
in segments.

785
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,560
Okay, let's do it!

786
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,840
They try to hit eight notes
correctly in a row.

787
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
They don't ring.

788
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,960
It's difficult.

789
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,320
In this challenge,
hitting once isn't very difficult.

790
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,240
But it doesn't continue if they want
to hit the bells consecutively.

791
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,560
- It's difficult.
- Yes, it is.

792
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,760
This is bad!

793
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,040
The challenge itself
is difficult enough,

794
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,560
and various problems occurred.

795
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,440
- First, the strength of the poles.
- I see.

796
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,840
The power of the students

797
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,360
breaks the iron poles
from the roots.

798
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,240
- Fixing them wasted a lot of time.
- This is bad.

799
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,120
They realised
there was a critical problem

800
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,480
at the end of filming the first half
for five hours.

801
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,480
What?

802
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm sorry.

803
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,120
It's the last part,
"do, do, re, mi, re, do, do."

804
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,080
The "do" has to be a low "do",

805
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,680
but we put the high "do" there.

806
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,920
They found out
they put a wrong bell there.

807
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm sorry.

808
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,360
To make things worse...

809
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,040
I think something is wrong.

810
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,800
Not only "do", "mi" is wrong, too.

811
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,520
They put the correct bells back
and did a final check.

812
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,680
- Isn't that wrong?
- It's wrong.

813
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,360
All-- Hey, how many bells
did you get wrong?

814
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,640
Nakaoka called the crew outside.

815
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,880
Of course!

816
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,200
Of course, I would!

817
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,520
Oh, no...

818
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,040
You let high school students see

819
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,160
how careless
The Quest's QTube Team is.

820
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,840
"Maybe the sounds of the bells
are wrong."

821
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,720
"What? Let's check."

822
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,480
"Oh, it's wrong."

823
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,280
"Let's check one more."

824
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,000
"Oh, this is wrong. This is wrong."

825
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,840
Three out of six.

826
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,400
Fifty per cent.

827
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,840
That's half.

828
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,880
It's dreadful.

829
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,680
You got the wrong bells,
three of them.

830
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,440
The poles break.

831
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,840
The girls' spirit can't be lifted
by Nakaoka.

832
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,920
Maybe this is the biggest reason.

833
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,640
The challenge carries on
to the next day.

834
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,360
The bells are stronger.

835
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,720
Today, they aim to hit 32 notes
correctly in the second half.

836
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,280
- Yes!
- Let's go!

837
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,560
Nakaoka does the first shot.

838
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,080
They'll see how many they'll hit
out of 32.

839
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Oh, nice!

840
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,480
Amazing. They've all improved.

841
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,360
It's quick!
They can hit at that speed?

842
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,880
The students practised
after filming yesterday.

843
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,280
The accuracy went up a lot.

844
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,920
- Impressive!
- It's impressive.

845
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
"Mistake, 1"

846
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,240
The last note is hit
by Nakaoka again.

847
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Do your best!

848
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,840
"Mistake, 6"

849
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,920
It's difficult! I was so nervous!

850
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,120
We made several mistakes, right?

851
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,880
That already makes me nervous.

852
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,840
Someone made a wrong sound.

853
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,080
- My order was wrong.
- It was the order. I see.

854
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,280
I see.

855
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,840
They can't make even one mistake
in this challenge.

856
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,240
Their biggest enemy is pressure.

857
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,920
You were nervous just now!

858
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,440
You were nervous!

859
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,880
- Let's go.
- After trying for four hours,

860
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,200
a big chance came.

861
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,920
Good.

862
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,680
Nakaoka makes a regrettable mistake.

863
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,640
So close!

864
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Oh, I'm sorry!

865
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,320
I'm sorry!

866
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,200
I was so nervous...

867
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,200
Please do it once more.

868
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,680
A girl is just as nervous
as Nakaoka.

869
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,280
It's Goalkeeper Kaede,
who plays the 31st note.

870
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,600
After all, she usually doesn't make
any shot.

871
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,520
I'm sorry.

872
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,040
- That was bad.
- Yeah.

873
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,000
You were stiff.

874
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,760
In the chance that comes next...

875
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,160
- Go, go.
- What colour?

876
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,840
"Do".

877
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,640
They changed the order
right before they do it.

878
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,080
You ran away from pressure
last minute.

879
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,200
Let's not do that.

880
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,000
Don't be beaten by pressure.

881
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,400
The goalkeeper must work well
under pressure.

882
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,440
- Yes.
- Let's go.

883
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Last one!

884
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,040
In the 320th time they try,
the time finally comes.

885
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,680
Please listen to Beethoven's

886
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,400
"Symphony No 9,
4th movement, Ode to Joy".

887
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
I'm happy.

888
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
You can do it.

889
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,320
I'm counting on you!

890
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,560
Let's give it our all...

891
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,400
No! I hit it! I hit it a bit!
I hit it a bit!

892
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,680
Look, it's trembling!
Look, it's trembling!

893
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,320
Yes!

894
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,600
Yes!

895
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,640
Okay! Yes!

896
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,720
You can do it.

897
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,680
Yay!

898
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,160
You're so noisy.

899
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,360
Don't shout, "Yay!"

900
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
Yay!

901
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,240
Let's go!

902
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,920
Now, they'll do the 32 notes
in uncut filming.

903
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,960
All right.

904
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,240
You can do it.

905
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,480
- The last seven notes.
- You can do it.

906
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,440
All right!

907
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,040
They did it successfully!

908
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,400
Yay!

909
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,360
We made it! I'm so happy!

910
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,400
I'm so happy!

911
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,720
You saved my life!

912
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,480
"You saved my life."

913
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,440
I thought I couldn't go back
to Tokyo!

914
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,120
Do your best to be
the national champion!

915
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,360
Yes!

916
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,280
Naha Nishi Prefectural High School
Girls' Handball Team,

917
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,880
thank you very much.
