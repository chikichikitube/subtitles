00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:18,285
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:22,490
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,530
These guys began their careers
in front of a live audience.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,501
If the audience in front of them laughs,
  they know how to build on that.

5
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,937
But here, they can't tell if their comedy
  is working or not.

6
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:41,041
I can imagine there would be times
  when they feel quite insecure.

7
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,911
What is with that hoodie?

8
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,413
"SORRY ABOUT THE FUSS"

9
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,548
-It's just a normal hoodie.
-No, it's not.

10
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:48,582
My good old hoodie.

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,485
-You've never worn that before.
-I always wear it.

12
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:55,189
The moment you attack is when
you're at your most vulnerable.

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,394
When you make a bad attack,
  you can end up laughing at yourself.

14
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,798
It's funny when
  you totally miss the target, right?

15
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,201
You think,
"Why did I make such a pathetic attempt?"

16
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,637
Sometimes that makes you laugh.

17
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,342
That sort of thing happens in comedy.

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,221
Seriously?

19
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:34,261
I had no idea

20
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,498
You had such beautiful nipples

21
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,537
-That was quick.
-It's so soon.

22
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,705
How quick!

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,007
I understand.

24
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,341
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO
Presents Documental

25
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,984
Okay, I get how this works now.

26
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,853
Does he really get it?

27
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,789
Okay. Let's go. Start.

28
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,492
Don't eat the eggshell.
You'll get a stomachache.

29
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,626
We're on?

30
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,762
-I thought it was boiled.
-Me too.

31
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,964
Why did you eat the shell of a raw egg?

32
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,532
I thought it was a boiled egg.

33
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,936
-You should've realized the first bite.
-One bite is enough.

34
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,071
It was heavy. Hold it. See?

35
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:27,207
-Heavy ones are boiled, right?
-It's as heavy as a normal egg.

36
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,910
But didn't you realize
the moment you bit it?

37
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,879
You can't tell until you bite through.

38
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,715
This one isn't boiled.

39
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,317
Gross.

40
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,519
This is a boiled egg.

41
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,787
-Really?
-Yes.

42
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,358
No, it's all slimy.

43
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,693
That's a raw egg.

44
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,995
Can't you tell? Don't swallow it.

45
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,330
He swallowed the shell.

46
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,631
He's like Rocky.

47
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,968
You grossed yourself out by eating that.

48
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:55,703
You'll bleed.

49
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,705
You're playing a super straight guy.

50
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,607
You play it so straight.

51
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,108
You're good at being straight.

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,209
Done it before?

53
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,412
-Yes, it's how I make my living.
-It's your job?

54
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,880
Are you cooking something?

55
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,083
-You want boiled eggs, right?
-Yes.

56
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,150
To erase the taste.

57
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,020
Do people ever want to eat boiled eggs
that badly?

58
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,455
Everyone loves boiled eggs.

59
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,856
You made such a mess.

60
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,159
-Thin people like you wouldn't get it.
-How true.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,228
You got fat by eating boiled eggs?

62
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,396
All of you?

63
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,531
-Yes.
-We eat a lot of eggs.

64
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,600
-I eat eggs, too.
-Oh, no...

65
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,535
Really?

66
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,038
Do I have body odor? My armpits stink.

67
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,974
-If you need a tissue, you can use mine.
-Thanks.

68
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,144
-Is it body odor? It smells bitter.
-I'll take some.

69
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,046
Huh?

70
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,983
-It's bitter.
-What's he doing?

71
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,220
What if it's body odor?

72
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,722
They smell bitter.

73
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,392
For real?

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,062
My mom always used a deodorant.
Did she smell too? Is this genetic?

75
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,967
She put on a strange powder.
Night after night.

76
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,403
In the kitchen. Under her armpits.

77
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,438
I thought I was safe.

78
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:05,906
It's kind of bitter.

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,642
Since we're talking about armpits,

80
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,413
do you sometimes find something
stuck in your armpit hair?

81
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,214
-Little white balls?
-What is that?

82
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,916
-It's "pitballdoo."
-Huh?

83
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,618
-Pitballdoo?
-Pitballdoo.

84
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,587
-It's called "pitballdoo"?
-Buffalo Goro A told me.

85
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,656
-It's pitballdoo.
-Pitballdoo?

86
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,626
When Daisuke found some,
A said, "That's pitballdoo."

87
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:26,794
Daisuke has it?

88
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,696
It has a name?

89
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,132
Daisuke said, "I've got something here."
So, A came over and said,

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,535
"That's pitballdoo."

91
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,503
Pitballdoo?

92
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,405
I've never heard of "pitballdoo."

93
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,341
I hate getting pitballdoo,
so I shave my armpits.

94
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,943
-Really?
-Give us a look.

95
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,144
I'm smooth.

96
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,146
-You are.
-You must really hate it.

97
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,147
So smooth.

98
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,551
I don't usually get pitballdoo,
but it sometimes comes after a bath.

99
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,219
I don't have much armpit hair.

100
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,222
-Yeah, that's quite thin.
-You hardly have any hair.

101
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,925
-I don't have much either.
-I get pitballdoo sometimes.

102
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,126
Everyone gets it?

103
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,961
-You shave, too.
-Just this morning.

104
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,429
-You get white balls?
-Yes.

105
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,531
You boiled the eggs so much, they melted!

106
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,200
-What are you doing?
-It's okay.

107
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,635
-It turned into soup.
-It's boiling over.

108
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,737
It's nearly ready.

109
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,106
-I'm almost done.
-It's dangerous. Turn it off!

110
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,640
-I'm nearly finished.
-Please.

111
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,510
-It looks like Yufuin Hot Spring.
-It's not Yufuin.

112
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,711
Pitballdoo!

113
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,279
Cut the "pitballdoo"!

114
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,181
I'm almost done.

115
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,117
I'm sorry about the wait.

116
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,152
-Is it Noboribetsu Hot Spring?
-No.

117
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:26,653
It's boiled eggs.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,722
-What's with the hot springs?
-Guys...

119
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,959
-Beppu Hot Springs?
-They're done. I'm turning off the heat.

120
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,661
-What's he doing?
-No idea.

121
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,797
-Look at that.
-Everything melted.

122
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,165
Oh, what a shame.

123
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,366
They disappeared!

124
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,269
-They went back to jelly.
-Jelly? Don't you mean egg?

125
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,904
The boiled eggs disappeared.

126
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,906
-Stop lying.
-They're gone.

127
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,243
I saw you, actually.
You only put little jellies into that.

128
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,378
What sort of joke is that?

129
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,948
I just wanted everyone to eat
something that was boiled.

130
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,116
What's with you?

131
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,417
I'll cool it down.

132
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,286
Let me cool it down.

133
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,990
-Be careful.
-That's dangerous. It's boiling water.

134
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,325
-I'll cool it down.
-You're on roller skates.

135
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,660
Seriously. Stop it.

136
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,529
-Watch out.
-We're not joking.

137
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,696
Seriously.

138
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,799
-You're on roller skates!
-It's dangerous!

139
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,801
-That's dangerous.
-Seriously.

140
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,303
-That's really dangerous.
-Stop it.

141
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,071
You really shouldn't do that!

142
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,306
Don't do it!

143
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,741
That burns!

144
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,042
That was hot!

145
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,511
-This is dangerous!
-Then put it down.

146
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,381
-Seriously, that's really dangerous.
-We're telling you.

147
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,415
I'll put it down.

148
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,683
I'm on roller skates!

149
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,818
Don't do it!

150
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,486
-Ouch!
-Watch out!

151
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,687
What were you thinking?

152
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,255
"SORRY ABOUT THE FUSS"

153
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,157
Don't apologize with your T-shirt.

154
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,792
That was more than just a fuss.

155
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,863
It's the same design as your hoodie?

156
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,665
Seriously.

157
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,734
-No more boiling water.
-Let's stop before someone gets hurt.

158
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,037
Take off those silly shoes now.

159
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,205
Ow!

160
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:52,840
Ow!

161
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,274
What's wrong?

162
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,777
That really hurts.

163
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,179
That really hurts!

164
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,349
This really hurts.

165
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,419
Try it yourself.

166
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,554
It has a "tap" mode.

167
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,324
He's moving automatically.

168
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,259
But my shoulders aren't stiff.

169
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,160
That's scary.

170
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,094
Does it hurt?

171
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,963
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

172
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,299
-Are you starting to relax?
-This is not cool. Really.

173
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,768
-Are you making yourself do that?
-No. Honestly.

174
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,104
Oh, God!

175
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,740
Wow.

176
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,275
It hurts that much?

177
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,977
This is amazing.

178
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,411
This is "knead" mode.

179
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,580
Yamamoto, this is really not good.

180
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,284
That's dangerous. That's enough.

181
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,153
Wow, Yamamoto. This is amazing.

182
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,222
-Please, Yamamoto.
-You want a break?

183
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,658
-Can I stop? My shoulders aren't stiff.
-Really?

184
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,360
Try it yourself.

185
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,097
-That's my seat.
-Yours is over there.

186
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,132
No, that's mine.

187
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,671
-Are you making trouble?
-No, I'm--

188
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,347
Was that the Kasu Kasu Dance?
Kasuga's "Kasu Kasu."

189
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,649
Damn!

190
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,083
It's the Kasu Kasu Dance.

191
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,152
-You're right.
-It's the Kasu Kasu.

192
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,654
It's the Kasu Kasu Dance.

193
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:14,788
The Kasu Kasu.

194
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,424
-Tasu!
-How does the original go?

195
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,526
-He said, "Tasu."
-It's "Kasu."

196
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,534
Let's do it over here, too.

197
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,337
That's scary.

198
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,205
You look like that Fan Lady.

199
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,475
-The Fan Lady?
-This can't be good for you.

200
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,944
Do you have one, too?

201
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,112
There are two machines. He brought it.

202
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,849
-The same thing?
-He brought electric therapy equipment?

203
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,320
-It's his own?
-What brand are these?

204
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,523
-I've never seen one without a name.
-That looks cool.

205
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,992
Those don't work on me at all.

206
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,660
-Really?
-Yeah.

207
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,996
-For real?
-It's quite strong.

208
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,334
-Are you that strong?
-Honestly.

209
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,969
He seems to enjoy it.

210
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,005
-These things never work on me.
-They don't work on you?

211
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,441
-It must work on you.
-Could you turn mine down?

212
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,142
-Wow.
-Turn mine down!

213
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,412
When I do this on TV,
I have to fake the reaction.

214
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,116
-That sounds tough for a different reason.
-Wow.

215
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,318
-But it's working.
-I don't feel a thing.

216
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,653
You're moving a lot.

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,887
No, I'm not.

218
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,290
You're moving a whole lot.

219
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,959
-It's at max.
-I'm not moving at all.

220
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,761
-You are.
-You're moving a lot.

221
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,730
-I'm doing it myself.
-You're okay?

222
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,398
It's at max power.

223
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,899
Wow.

224
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,334
Doesn't that hurt?

225
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,670
Not at all.
I could do anything with this on.

226
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,939
But it really works on Kinoshita.

227
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,542
-You have to cut that out.
-He looks like Master Osamu.

228
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,811
-What mode does that?
-He's not Master Osamu.

229
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,113
He looks like a rhino.

230
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,714
It doesn't affect me at all.

231
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,951
You're going to spill the water.

232
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,654
That is definitely working.

233
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,058
-Let's try both.
-Won't that be too strong?

234
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,326
I'll go slowly.

235
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,695
Really? Is it okay to go double?

236
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,697
-What level is yours?
-10.

237
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,866
Level 10? I'll make this one 10, too.

238
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,835
-He said that he's fine.
-No, that's dangerous!

239
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,137
-Ready?
-Watch out!

240
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,339
-Level 10?
-Not when he's doubled.

241
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,574
-Level 10. "Tap" mode.
-He'll catch fire.

242
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,111
-Kobayashi. Come on. Stop it.
-Are you okay, Kobayashi?

243
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,613
Why don't you take them off?

244
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,882
-He's like Rambo.
-He can't feel it, right?

245
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,984
-That torture scene.
-That's too much.

246
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,386
-He doesn't feel it, right?
-You don't feel it?

247
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,056
-He's not Rambo. He's the Fan Lady.
-Like this.

248
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,324
-Remember Rambo?
-The Fan Lady.

249
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,927
-She's here?
-The Fan Lady.

250
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,662
-In  Rambo II.
-Iwahashi, your turn.

251
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,831
-My turn?
-They captured him.

252
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,399
Switch on.

253
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,106
Switch off.

254
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,240
Rambo, right?

255
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,810
-It's a scene from  Rambo.
-That electric shock one?

256
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,880
Kobayashi is in more trouble now.

257
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,150
-You're not getting real electricity.
-I was doing Rambo.

258
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,286
-You'll get KO'd.
-I can't feel a thing.

259
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,687
Really?

260
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,222
A man... A man...

261
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:06,159
A man who can stay in an electric bath
  for a long time

262
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,429
-This is a Sixpad.
-A six pad?

263
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,697
What is it?

264
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:11,731
Wow.

265
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:12,933
I want to try.

266
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,835
Ronaldo does the ads for this.

267
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:15,902
Wow.

268
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,471
-Cristiano Ronaldo.
-Cristiano.

269
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,172
-That's the new one.
-Right.

270
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,842
-Anyone know how it works?
-Toos.

271
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,276
-I've never used one.
-Toos.

272
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,644
-Toos.
-It goes on your abs.

273
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,279
-Toos.
-Why don't you know?

274
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,815
Well, this is the first time
I've tried it.

275
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,584
-Toos.
-Toos.

276
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,652
Do you say "Toos" to every "Toos"?

277
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,421
Of course, I react to your "Toos."

278
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,555
-Toos.
-Toos.

279
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,556
Shut up.

280
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,158
Toos.

281
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,726
-How do you say "tooth"?
-Toos.

282
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:40,827
Tooth!

283
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,928
Tooth!

284
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,697
Tooth!

285
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,001
-What was your other joke?
-The demon tile.

286
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,436
Demon tile!

287
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,805
Who laughs at that?

288
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,807
It does well in Africa.

289
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:54,708
Demon tile?

290
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,476
-His fans laugh at it.
-Fans?

291
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,545
-Go live in Africa.
-Live in Africa.

292
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,479
-Toos.
-Toos.

293
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,614
-Toos!
-Toos.

294
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,349
-No money.
-Toos!

295
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,783
-No money.
-No money.

296
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,118
Toos!

297
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,088
No money. You're finished.

298
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,823
No money. You're finished.

299
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,358
-No.
-Are you Toos?

300
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,326
-Yes, I am Toos.
-No, you're not Toos.

301
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,427
-Toos!
-Toos.

302
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,695
You're not Toos.

303
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,397
You're no money. You're finished.

304
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,298
No!

305
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,366
Toos!

306
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,670
What did all that mean?

307
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,238
It's Toos.

308
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,706
Toos!

309
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,209
He's using that electric cigarette.

310
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,646
He's protecting himself from laughing
with that.

311
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,814
What?

312
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,851
The Sixpad has disappeared. Why?

313
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:38,885
What?

314
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,655
-The Sixpad's gone.
-You had it.

315
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,323
-Exactly.
-Where did it go?

316
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,426
-It disappeared during our Toos.
-Is that it?

317
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,961
Isn't that it?

318
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,296
It's black, right?

319
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,498
-Maybe it's...
-It's black.

320
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,534
Maybe it's on someone's stomach.

321
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,171
-Nobody's wearing it.
-I wanted to put it on.

322
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,340
-It's gone.
-How could it disappear?

323
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,108
Is RG wearing it?

324
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,745
-Where did the Sixpad go?
-Why isn't it here?

325
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,280
It's orange, right?

326
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,249
Is it orange?

327
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,451
It has a black front and orange back.

328
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,852
You found it!

329
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,854
Was it you?

330
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,957
-He hid it.
-No, I didn't.

331
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,226
-Not so fast. I didn't hide it.
-Seriously?

332
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,228
You hid it. It was down here.

333
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,597
Wait a minute.
I wouldn't do a thing like that.

334
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,665
-I should've guessed.
-You were behind me.

335
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:26,566
It wasn't me.

336
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,934
Wakkenage!

337
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,869
-Hiding things isn't nice.
-Apologize.

338
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:30,870
Sorry.

339
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,873
-Do it right.
-Apologize properly.

340
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,810
Sorry.

341
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,911
More!

342
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,649
Sorry.

343
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,852
-Done.
-Well, okay.

344
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:46,920
-Really?
-Toos.

345
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,355
That's not acceptable!

346
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,489
That's not--

347
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,793
Jumping chair part two!

348
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,998
What does "wakkenage" mean?

349
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,100
You're caught up on that?

350
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,468
My "wakkenage"?

351
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,370
I think it sticks to you.

352
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,272
I'll take a seat.

353
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,507
You're taking too long with that.

354
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,077
-Why didn't you prepare it beforehand?
-You'd usually try at home first.

355
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:12,846
Construction worker.

356
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,681
-Let's wait.
-Come on.

357
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,683
It's taken so long, I'm sick of it.

358
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,485
-That's enough.
-I'm nearly there.

359
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,953
There's only one piece left.

360
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,355
-You never used that before?
-No, I haven't.

361
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,391
You finally responded to me!

362
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,494
-Wasn't he answering you?
-Sorry.

363
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,929
-No wonder he's angry.
-He's your senior.

364
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,665
-You ignored him?
-Sorry.

365
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,034
-He's the biggest. He's scary.
-He's intense.

366
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,735
He ignored you the whole time?

367
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,537
He ignored you?

368
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,239
I wouldn't say that.

369
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,874
-Intentionally?
-Of course not.

370
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,409
But so many people are here.

371
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,211
-He's a lot older than you.
-I know. I'm sorry.

372
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,579
We apologize, too.

373
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,281
He's angry with you now.

374
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,649
It's fine.

375
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,318
He's mad now.

376
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,219
I'm not mad.

377
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,989
I just didn't like it. I'm sorry.

378
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,825
-I didn't like being ignored.
-It's not nice.

379
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,627
I didn't mean to ignore him.

380
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,196
-He's your senior.
-I doubt he actually ignored me.

381
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,532
-It wasn't on purpose, right?
-Of course not.

382
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,169
-There were just too many people.
-It only seemed like he ignored you.

383
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,470
But with no response--

384
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,738
I plugged one more in.

385
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,442
-He definitely ignored you.
-Hey. You did it again.

386
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,410
You totally ignored the old lady.

387
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,678
Old lady?

388
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:19,679
Sorry.

389
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,681
-It's ready.
-Finally!

390
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,684
-Put it on.
-It sticks to you, right?

391
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,119
Roll up your shirt.

392
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,321
But with abs like yours,
you don't need it.

393
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,757
-Good point.
-He's right.

394
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,592
That might be true.

395
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:34,894
Is this vest new?

396
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:36,563
I just bought it.

397
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,331
That's a weird way to undress.

398
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,167
-He's worried about the mic.
-Don't slam it.

399
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,369
What's he doing?

400
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,303
I'll strip you.

401
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,571
Just do it already.

402
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,678
What are you doing?

403
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,913
How did he put it on?

404
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,683
Nice body.

405
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,288
-We can see your nipples.
-You should hide them.

406
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,523
Nice body.

407
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,859
Kukky is trying hard to fool us.

408
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,160
Wow.

409
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,195
He won't get away with it next time.

410
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,930
-It's touching your ribs.
-Here?

411
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,933
-That looks good.
-Your body doesn't need more training.

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,802
Should I put these on, too?

413
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,239
-On his shoulders and his stomach.
-He will definitely feel this.

414
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,908
-Will it make him Rambo?
-Is it turned on?

415
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,043
-How is that?
-It's beeping.

416
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,279
-Can you feel it?
-I can! It's on my abs!

417
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,248
He's twitching.

418
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,616
Wow.

419
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,785
-Your shoulders, right?
-It's doing my abs.

420
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,720
-Your shoulders.
-My abs!

421
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,923
-This thing really works.
-On your shoulders, not your abs.

422
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,024
100% the shoulders.

423
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,693
-Wow. My abs.
-It's doing his chest, too.

424
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,395
His chest is pumped up.

425
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,965
This is intense.
My abs won't take much more.

426
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,467
-Wow.
-This is amazing.

427
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,837
-This is amazing.
-Wow. My abs.

428
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,239
-It's your shoulders.
-Ronaldo is amazing.

429
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,941
Toos!

430
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,776
Toos!

431
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,612
Demon tile.

432
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,748
Kasu Kasu.

433
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,983
Kasu... Kasu Kasu.

434
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,718
Kasu Kasu.

435
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,154
You're smiling. Are you okay with that?

436
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,622
We can see your nipples.

437
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,325
-It's definitely a shoulder workout.
-Wow.

438
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,097
Kasuga, please show us
one of your bodybuilding poses.

439
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,365
Here I go.

440
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,602
Side chest.

441
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,238
Don't forget to smile.

442
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,406
Smile!

443
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,075
-I can't smile right now.
-Show us a smile!

444
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,243
-Way to go!
-Come on!

445
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,812
-Her nipple won't fit.
-You're big!

446
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,814
-Hide the nipple.
-Looking good!

447
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,249
Her nipple won't...

448
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,318
-Sorry.
-Hide the nipple.

449
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,520
You're looking good!

450
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,090
Kasuga, I know you've been
bodybuilding for a long time.

451
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,993
But Goto has a much better body.

452
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,595
He does.

453
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,697
-Goto works out.
-You do?

454
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,300
You work out?

455
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,602
A little bit.

456
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,736
Really?

457
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:58,972
-Want a look?
-Yes.

458
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,241
Please.

459
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,775
Thanks.

460
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,212
We don't usually get to see Goto naked.

461
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,516
The thing about Goto's body is
you'd probably say it's "sharp."

462
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,485
What's the word? "Cut"?

463
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,454
Right. He is cut.

464
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:15,755
What does "cut" mean?

465
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,025
-It's the shape of the muscle.
-He'd be in the "physique" class.

466
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,294
-Either "physique" or "best body."
-"Best body."

467
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,962
Not the "bodybuilding" class.

468
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,465
He's just like tofu.

469
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:26,933
Tofu.

470
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,334
Udon with tofu.

471
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,238
-Udon with tofu?
-Bean curd skin.

472
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,609
Tofu?

473
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,879
-Why are you holding that?
-We're going in order.

474
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:40,880
Aren't we?

475
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,116
We've had enough of that.

476
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,618
You've had that in your hands
the whole time.

477
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,053
You're like a salesman.

478
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,356
I understand the urge to stick it on.

479
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,359
All that did is make us shake.
Nothing more.

480
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,795
Then what do you want to buy?

481
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,530
We've had enough.

482
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,265
Does that work on you?

483
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,367
Of course it does.

484
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,536
If you don't want--

485
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,773
Is that how you spent the past 10 years?
You sold those things?

486
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,075
You sold them,
and meat-wrapped rice balls?

487
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,911
I sold these and meat-wrapped rice balls
door-to-door.

488
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,980
-Door-to-door?
-That's right.

489
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,916
-You sold meat-wrapped rice balls?
-Door-to-door.

490
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,252
Who buys rice balls from
traveling salesmen?

491
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,521
Goto, there's a guitar here.

492
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,356
That's a violin.

493
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,058
There's a guitar.

494
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:27,760
A guitar.

495
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,262
It's a violin.

496
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,331
Play with that on.

497
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:32,832
Allow me.

498
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,102
Give me a break.
I'm not good at doing things like this.

499
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,504
Do it slowly then. From the lowest level.

500
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,239
It may not work on you.

501
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,241
Why do I have to hold this?

502
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,378
That's hot!

503
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,250
-The electricity is making him play.
-Wow.

504
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,354
-He's playing with electricity.
-It's an electric guitar.

505
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,322
How true! He's The Ventures.

506
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,793
Wow.

507
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,630
Playing with electricity.

508
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,578
Who was that?

509
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,847
You totally laughed.

510
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,383
You made yourself laugh by joining in.

511
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,019
You laughed as you went "bi-bi-bi."

512
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,054
As though we were in the dressing room.

513
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,591
What is wrong with you?

514
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,192
Seriously.

515
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,395
It goes without saying, right?

516
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,465
Playing with electricity.

517
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,976
-You clearly laughed.
-Sorry.

518
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,844
-You get a yellow card.
-Yellow.

519
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,279
I accept that.

520
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,983
And Yamamoto...

521
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,285
You seem to be having fun.

522
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,854
I am having fun.

523
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,122
It really is fun.

524
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,591
You're making us doubt you.

525
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,327
Everyone is thinking, "Hmm..."

526
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,164
We're glad to see you too, but...

527
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,665
I get your point.

528
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,067
Keep up the good work.

529
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,176
It's too early to be getting naked.

530
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,645
-You're right.
-Only 45 minutes have passed.

531
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,346
Being naked isn't funny anyway.

532
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,315
Start.

533
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,752
-You were funny.
-Really.

534
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,053
You're like bean curd.

535
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,756
-I wrote everyone a letter. Can I read it?
-No.

536
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,125
What do you mean, no?

537
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,728
-You wrote to everyone?
-Yes.

538
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,097
-Individual letters?
-Just one, to everyone.

539
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,833
-But you didn't know who would be here.
-That's right.

540
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,569
I wrote it to the members I'd meet here.

541
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,504
If it's not personal, it won't work.

542
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,040
-Its message won't reach us.
-We don't need it.

543
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,608
-Don't read it.
-Your bad.

544
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,376
-Throw it away.
-That's your bad.

545
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,078
Go read it over there.

546
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,581
Read it on the other side of the sofa.

547
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,282
Can't I read it to you here?

548
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,351
Read it out loud in the locker room.

549
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:06,753
-That's best.
-For real?

550
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,455
-Can't I read it here?
-No point.

551
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,691
It's our choice whether we listen or not.

552
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,193
-This could be dangerous.
-You might ignore me?

553
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,228
Of course.

554
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,464
-Kinoshita, why don't you join him?
-Not me.

555
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,368
"Dear members of  Documental.

556
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,005
"If I am reading this, it must have begun.

557
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,007
"It must have begun!"

558
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,208
He is so loud.

559
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,511
"The game has begun, right?

560
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,679
"Everyone. Everyone.

561
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,214
"Everyone!"

562
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,316
-We heard you.
-"Did you sleep well?

563
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,851
"I couldn't sleep!

564
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:39,919
"Huh?

565
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,320
"Say... Say...

566
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,421
"Say!"

567
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,191
-It needs a rewrite.
-"How do you feel, feel.

568
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,192
"Feel!

569
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,293
"Let's feel!"

570
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,197
A normal letter would have been worse.

571
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,699
-If it was normal, I may have laughed.
-Right.

572
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,067
-This is no problem.
-Yeah.

573
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,435
Damn it!

574
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,004
Give it a rewrite.

575
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,339
Why can't I read properly?

576
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,710
-The letter was normal, but he can't read.
-That was the joke?

577
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,779
-The problem wasn't the text.
-Apparently.

578
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,949
Sorry for the clumsy attempt
and for giving up halfway through.

579
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,617
-You can't read properly?
-No.

580
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:12,518
I see.

581
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,288
Why can't I even do something so simple?

582
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,590
You made it ring.

583
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:21,093
Reading is a simple task.

584
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:23,396
How could I screw that up?

585
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,731
I wrote a letter, too.

586
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,400
You're kidding.

587
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,635
-Two in a row?
-Can I read it?

588
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,237
Really?

589
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,207
Should we make it a rule that
letters are read over there?

590
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,408
I think so.

591
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,310
I'm going to read it.

592
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,413
"Documental.

593
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,315
"Season Three."

594
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,749
He's so quiet.

595
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,487
"Dear participants.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

596
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,424
"I'm Motoharu Sano."

597
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,260
-It's an emotional reading.
-It's an impression.

598
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,928
-"I'm Motoharu Sano."
-Who?

599
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,065
-Motoharu Sano.
-It's an impression. He can't talk loudly.

600
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,435
"Looking back on things now,

601
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,104
"we spent so many  Somedays together."

602
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,909
Motoharu Sano is a slow talker.
This will take ages.

603
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,478
-He's so quiet.
-Right?

604
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,081
"So, you had it all wrong."

605
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,649
I can't hear him at all.

606
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,050
Me neither.

607
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,486
-Did you get it?
-Loud and clear.

608
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,421
-Wakkenage?
-We got it.

609
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,523
-Did you really write that?
-Yes.

610
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,659
-You wrote a letter, too?
-I did.

611
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,729
I was given a letter, too.

612
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,330
It was given to you?

613
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,666
From who? What does he mean?

614
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,735
Letters have to be read over there.

615
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,238
"So, um...

616
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,107
"Okay. I was wondering...

617
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,542
"You come here to shoot TV shows.

618
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,411
"I don't know why.

619
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,282
"But you keep coming here to shoot, right?

620
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,551
"Right? That's not a problem.

621
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:55,321
"I don't mind you coming
to film your shows.

622
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:59,058
"But after it's finished,
you always ask to take a few things home.

623
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,994
"Right? I don't know why.

624
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:05,564
"But you guys want my
radio-controlled cars and my air guns.

625
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,035
"I don't mind you coming,
but can't you all come at once?

626
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,203
"After all, you guys,

627
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,306
"you come here..."

628
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,207
Who is this supposed to be?

629
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,510
-"You always take something."
-Who is it?

630
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,846
-It's like he's rehearsing for a play.
-He said it was a letter.

631
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,317
-He's impersonating somebody.
-"I'll ban you from coming to my base."

632
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,852
It's someone who gets interviewed
on TV a lot.

633
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,554
-What?
-A restaurant?

634
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,524
-"However..."
-This is way too long.

635
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:35,094
-"You take my air guns."
-They take his air guns?

636
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:38,164
"You take my radio-controlled cars, too.

637
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,733
"You always want so much."

638
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,035
-Is that George Tokoro?
-Tokoro-san?

639
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:46,238
-It doesn't sound like him at all.
-It must be someone else.

640
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,206
Right?

641
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,108
-Was that Tokoro?
-Who was it?

642
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,844
Tokoro-san just dropped by.

643
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,747
-That was Tokoro?
-It didn't sound like him at all.

644
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,383
Apparently a lot goes down at Base.

645
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,085
At Setagaya Base?

646
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,454
-His fancy garage?
-People take things home.

647
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,990
Would you mind gathering around?

648
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,792
I brought some ghost photos.

649
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,395
That's scary. Please don't show them.

650
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:13,165
I'm scared I might laugh at something,
so can we look at some ghost photos?

651
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,633
Ghost photos?

652
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,369
-Really?
-I really don't want to.

653
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,470
Please don't do it.

654
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,606
-It really is a ghost. Take a look.
-Seriously?

655
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:21,674
A ghost?

656
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,015
That's a shrunken head.

657
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,017
-That's scary.
-It's so small.

658
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,318
"Master Shrunken-Head."

659
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,720
-Is he in the background?
-No, he's in front.

660
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,690
-If he's behind, his body should be small.
-It's the angle.

661
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,258
Only his head is shrunk.

662
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,094
-Is Master Daisuke a ghost?
-It can't be the angle.

663
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,763
His body's here.

664
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,464
That's so small.

665
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,000
Why did you take a photo during their act?

666
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,169
Because it's a ghost photo.

667
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,171
What does that mean?

668
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,507
That's scary.

669
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,043
This one's small, too.

670
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,378
-Which one is the ghost?
-That's Hanako.

671
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,447
-Which is the ghost?
-That's Hanako.

672
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,582
-Is Hanako the ghost?
-Hanako is...

673
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:04,917
Kinoshita, look properly.

674
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:05,818
I'm looking.

675
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,153
Look, asswipe!

676
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,154
He's your senior.

677
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,388
That's scary.

678
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,724
Look how small he is.

679
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,960
-Kinoshita, look at this one.
  -Yamamoto is close.

680
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,496
So small.

681
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,099
-Yamamoto is close.
-Do heads get that small?

682
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,568
-You have so many photos.
-His hands grew, too.

683
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:23,669
They did. Wow.

684
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:35,848
I didn't laugh.

685
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,083
Me neither.

686
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,518
-Was it Yamamoto?
-He's been smiling all day.

687
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:40,953
I didn't laugh.

688
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,455
What about this photo?

689
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,723
If this is for you...

690
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,593
-Look what happened here.
-His head is normal size.

691
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,661
Yamamoto!

692
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,332
Orange.

693
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,934
Really?

694
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,635
You're very smiley today.

695
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,270
You're a smiley guy.

696
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,107
Do heads get that small?

697
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,576
-You have so many photos.
-His hands grew, too.

698
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,677
They did. Wow.

699
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:11,550
I warned you.
You should have tried looking angry.

700
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,319
Otherwise, you'd be in trouble.

701
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:18,224
I know how you feel.
I'd laugh at that, too.

702
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,825
You can't show people this.

703
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:23,362
I hope they find out and summon you
for a good scolding.

704
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:26,665
I'm on my last life.
I'm going to lose, damn it.

705
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,635
I don't want to lose
a million yen like this!

706
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:32,171
-You can't just not look.
-I already saw them.

707
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,272
I'm done for!

708
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,041
You really can't do that.
You have to look at them.

709
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,309
-I'm done for!
-Start.

710
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,446
Kinoshita, you have to look.

711
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:44,416
-Can you do that without touching me?
-Have you been looking at the photos?

712
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,852
-Okay? I've been looking.
-I saw them, too.

713
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,220
No, you didn't.

714
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,589
-I'm done for!
-Let's gather around.

715
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,024
Let's all look together--

716
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,259
Ouch!

717
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,562
-This is good.
-Don't resort to violence.

718
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:57,830
I'm done for!

719
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,999
-You've gone crazy.
-Anyone can see.

720
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,634
That can't be helped.

721
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,701
Why am I almost out?

722
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,639
-Stop that.
-What's your problem?

723
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,841
Hey!

724
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:11,510
-Don't hit the old lady.
-You're the one who laughed.

725
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,547
-It's your fault.
-He's lost it.

726
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,149
I'm the only one with so many cards.

727
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,618
-That's no excuse.
-I have no chance.

728
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:22,154
-You're the one who laughed.
-No more violence.

729
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,723
-You can't do that.
  -Yamamoto.

730
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,592
-Stop hiding.
-Please look.

731
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,928
-Don't close your eyes.
-Look at the photo.

732
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:29,962
Look!

733
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,098
-I think you should look.
-Kinoshita, too.

734
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:36,168
-You have to look, too.
-Let's all look together.

735
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:37,970
They're pioneers at Yoshimoto.

736
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,472
-Let's all look together.
-They're our pioneers.

737
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,941
Hurry up, guys.

738
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,776
It's not fair if you don't look.

739
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,178
Kinoshita, look here.
You get the best seat.

740
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,548
-You didn't see the first few.
  -Kukky is close, too.

741
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,117
That can't be an official profile photo.

742
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,621
-There's a normal-size version, too.
-His head isn't that small.

743
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,926
-Kinoshita?
-Wait a minute.

744
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:06,932
Goto?

745
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,033
It's Goto.

746
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,435
He lost it now?

747
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,570
-Was that Goto?
-He laughed.

748
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,606
-It's definitely Goto.
-What a surprise.

749
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:15,874
Of course this makes me laugh.

750
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,211
-You can't help but laugh.
  -It's too much.

751
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:21,680
-That's not fair.
  -That's too much.

752
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,649
This will land you in trouble.

753
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,684
-You have no respect.
-Of course, I do.

754
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,420
You have no respect at all.

755
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,289
And don't diss their fashion sense.

756
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,490
Who is it?

757
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,459
Goto.

758
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:37,029
These kinds of things are my weak point.

759
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,632
You smiled so hard,
your eyes nearly popped.

760
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,102
That can't be an official profile photo.

761
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,705
-There's a normal-size version, too.
-His head isn't that small.

762
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,877
-Kinoshita?
-Wait a minute.

763
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:59,018
This photo is downright rude.

764
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,453
-I'm just showing my respect.
  -It's taboo.

765
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,389
You're insulting these veterans.

766
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,658
You have a computer to make these?

767
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,534
-Some people haven't seen them yet.
-You have to look.

768
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,603
-Kasuga, look at them.
-I already did.

769
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,204
Kasuga, you didn't.

770
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,372
I did look at them.

771
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,274
-You didn't look at them.
-I did.

772
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,842
Restart.

773
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,278
We're on!

774
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,114
Kasuga and Kinoshita should
sit in front of the photos.

775
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,050
-Take one look.
-Just a minute.

776
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,951
You two have to sit over here.

777
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,020
Take a look at them face-to-face.

778
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,222
You haven't looked properly.
That's unfair.

779
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,258
-Just sit down and look.
-I already did.

780
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,660
It's not fair if you don't look.
Seriously.

781
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,797
-I'm tidying them up now.
-Why don't we all look together?

782
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,964
We already looked!

783
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,901
Let's all look together.
We should form a line.

784
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,102
Line up like this.

785
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,105
-Don't fake it by focusing somewhere else.
-Okay.

786
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,908
-Let's stare straight at them.
-All together.

787
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,309
Let's start from the top.

788
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,712
-Again?
-Start from where we left off.

789
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,281
Just show us the last two photos.

790
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,551
-We already saw these.
-Show us the last two.

791
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,287
We don't need a revision.

792
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,423
I can't take this.

793
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,161
Date laughed.

794
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,997
-He laughed out loud.
-It was a completely normal laugh.

795
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,400
He said, "I can't take this."
Then he broke up.

796
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,535
That photo's a killer. Wow.

797
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,471
-What was that?
-You laughed out loud.

798
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,239
Was this one here before?

799
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,074
That was the worst laugh yet.

800
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,712
-These pictures are dangerous.
-They're too much.

801
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,214
That was a proper laugh.

802
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,915
This isn't right.

803
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,218
See? That's why I was wary.

804
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,586
-Date.
-Yes?

805
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:43,355
-This isn't right.
-You went "ha ha ha."

806
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,758
Then you said, "I can't take this."

807
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,593
"I can't take this" and "ha ha ha."

808
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,129
But his head kept getting smaller.

809
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,232
Date gets an orange card.

810
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:59,004
Just show us the last two photos.

811
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,207
-We already saw these.
-Show us the last two.

812
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:05,077
We don't need a revision.

813
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:07,980
I can't take this.

814
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,485
Date laughed.

815
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,254
If you keep this up,

816
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,123
the second episode will be
all about Daisuke &amp; Hanako.

817
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,293
-All of Episode 2.
  -I'll take out everyone with these?

818
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,830
If you laugh out loud,
I have to give you that card.

819
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,398
-Okay.
-Keep up the good work.

820
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:27,833
He looks like The Mountain.

821
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:33,005
-He really does.
  -He's The Mountain.

822
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,114
Sit down.

823
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,983
-Kinoshita.
-Sit down where you were.

824
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,286
You need to look at them face-to-face.

825
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,855
-Sit where you were.
-I'm used to them now.

826
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,924
-Kasuga, please look.
-I already did.

827
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:53,692
-Really?
-I don't think so.

828
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,260
-I did.
-Sit down.

829
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,029
I was looking just now.

830
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,164
-It won't end otherwise.
-Okay.

831
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,333
Don't focus on how his head shrinks.

832
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,136
-I can't look. It's my last life.
-That doesn't matter.

833
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,204
Here we go.

834
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,607
Yeah, I saw that one before.

835
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,610
I really don't like this.

836
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,615
-Okay. Fine.
  -I really don't like these photos.

837
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:18,383
-I think I'm safe now.
-Look, Date.

838
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,119
-Date.
-You need to look.

839
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,322
-You have to look.
-I am looking.

840
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,157
No, you're not. You're facing away.

841
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,592
That isn't right.

842
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,627
You need to come here and look.

843
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,563
-My mic needs new batteries.
-It's too early for that.

844
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,699
-Have a seat.
-I'm looking, too.

845
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,934
Date, don't worry. They're a pair.

846
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,036
-They're the same.
-Have a good look.

847
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,905
See? Master Hanako is the same.

848
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,776
In the next one, it's not his head.
This time it's his arm.

849
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,412
He looks like the Hulk.

850
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,914
This is the last one.

851
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,356
Yaseibakudan Kawashima!

852
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,361
You're mocking me, right?

853
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,131
Who are you?

854
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:07,699
Daisuke.

855
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,002
You're not even close.

856
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,238
-It's me.
-Daisuke doesn't talk like that.

857
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,239
It was just RG.

858
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,608
But thank you for interrupting.

859
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,343
That killed the joke.

860
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:22,548
If you hadn't said something,
Kukky would have laughed.

861
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,349
I was really close to laughing.

862
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,386
-You sure found some great photos.
-They're amazing.

863
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:28,954
Where was this one shot?

864
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,390
-Let me give you a reward.
-Thanks.

865
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,060
How tiny.

866
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,296
It's tiny sushi.

867
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,232
I can't eat normal sushi.
Thanks for giving me the egg.

868
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,304
Wow.

869
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,173
His hand is... Goto.

870
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,475
Goto, look at his hand.

871
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,844
-It's hand-sushi.
  -Look at Goto.

872
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,479
"Hey...

873
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,181
"Hey, my hand is...

874
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,717
"You turned my hand into sushi.

875
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,118
"My hand...

876
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,054
"You turned my hand into sushi."

877
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,690
"Shut up. Leave the talking to me."

878
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,826
"Sushi."

879
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,665
Isn't that sushi cute?

880
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,068
-Is that an eraser?
-It is.

881
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,337
-Does it erase?
-It's a funny eraser.

882
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,239
But the seaweed part is plastic.

883
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,508
Well, I guess you have to remove it.

884
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,579
But maybe the egg part leaves
a yellow mark.

885
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,082
-It should be okay. It's an eraser.
-I see.

886
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,751
Who did this?

887
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,187
I did. It's for all of you.

888
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:39,091
-I thought you might like some watermelon.
-Wow. Thank you.

889
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,760
I was still cutting it when
that last bit started.

890
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,663
Can anybody eat watermelon
like Ken Shimura-san does?

891
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,599
-It's harder than it looks.
-You end up choking.

892
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,901
-It's that hard?
-Can anyone do it?

893
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,906
-Watch your hand.
-Be careful, Yamamoto...

894
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,676
What a sly move.

895
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,879
When I showed the photos,
he shut the door.

896
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,748
He protected himself physically?

897
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,617
There's a lot of paper here.

898
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:06,718
Should we clean up?

899
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,421
-Let's clean this up a little.
-Good idea.

900
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,393
Over here, too.

901
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,561
Ow.

902
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,000
Did someone throw a ball at me?

903
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,301
What?

904
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,870
Was it Kinoshita?

905
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,807
-You owe Kinoshita an apology.
-It wasn't me.

906
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,709
He was way back there.

907
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,078
It hit me.

908
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:36,048
It hit me out of the blue. For nothing.

909
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,851
-Nothing hit you. Nothing was thrown.
-Nothing happened.

910
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:41,953
-Thank you.
-Wow!

911
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:43,789
-Thanks!
-Thank you!

912
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,159
-We might as well enjoy it.
-Wow.

913
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:51,963
Thanks.

914
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,800
It's written backwards. "UFO."

915
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,601
What an idiot.

916
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,839
I have a three-year-old daughter.

917
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,377
Yesterday she said I had to do something.

918
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:08,113
She gave me something of hers.
It was her panties.

919
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,416
But she's only three...

920
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,022
-You wore them?
-How nice of you. You did that for her?

921
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,157
I forgot he was a daddy.

922
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,659
What an idiot.

923
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,627
Your ball sack is hanging out.

924
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,563
A little fire has broken out.

925
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,898
-You're right.
-It doesn't all fit.

926
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,834
They're sticking out.

927
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,504
-But you are a good father.
-The pants sort of work, too.

928
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,540
-She'll love that you did it.
-Did she ask you to wear them?

929
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,576
She gave them to me...

930
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,779
"SORRY ABOUT THE FUSS"

931
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,082
Now we have a traffic accident.

932
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,362
The "F" is back-to-front.

933
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,133
Because I wrote it in the mirror?

934
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,034
So that's why nobody laughed?

935
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,870
That's probably not the reason.

936
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:05,771
UFO

937
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,407
-I crashed into somebody's joke?
-You came out at the same time.

938
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,576
-Who did I bump into?
-I think it was me.

939
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,745
-You should have waited.
-Sorry.

940
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,481
I didn't think you'd come so quickly.

941
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,550
Please.

942
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:22,387
You ruined it.
Why is "ON" written on your forehead?

943
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,929
That was RG.

944
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,297
It's RG.

945
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,498
Actually...

946
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,667
No, no. All I did was blow out air.

947
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,302
-It's both of them.
-It's RG.

948
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,403
I just breathed out.

949
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,939
No, there was definitely laughter
in that breath.

950
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,475
-But I...
-Either way, RG's out.

951
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,243
Iwahashi is lying.

952
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,312
-You could tell by his voice.
-It's RG.

953
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:50,448
I just tried to read his forehead.
A backwards "UFO."

954
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:51,850
That's why I was puffing.

955
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,018
Well...

956
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,586
It's RG.

957
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,756
-Shall we take a look?
-Okay.

958
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,958
At the exact moment.

959
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,595
Why is "ON" written on your forehead?

960
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,900
That's clearly a laugh.

961
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,068
It sure is.

962
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,137
-That's out.
-No excuses.

963
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,338
-Right?
-Yeah.

964
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,607
-That gets a yellow card.
-Yes.

965
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,610
Was that "UFO" an honest mistake?

966
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,011
Or a joke?

967
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,613
I did it for real.

968
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,049
Because of the mirror?

969
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,052
-I had no idea what you'd written.
-It took a while.

970
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,454
That was the only thing
you had to do properly.

971
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,423
-Right?
-That's the most important part.

972
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,125
-Unbelievable.
-That damn mirror.

973
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,663
-Iwahashi laughed, too.
-He was close, right?

974
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,266
-He's using his condition as an excuse.
-Exactly.

975
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,236
-That's the worst thing you can do.
-It's not right.

976
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:48,840
What's with that?

977
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,810
They're scary. They really are.

978
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,650
Let's go.

979
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,121
-Shall we eat?
-Yes.

980
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,122
Thank you!

981
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,957
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

982
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,359
Can you eat like Shimura?

983
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,327
Someone should try.

984
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:10,829
I've never--

985
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:12,764
Let's find a successor...

986
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:15,700
-That was quick.
-Really?

987
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,437
Were you being smiley again?

988
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,574
It wasn't me.

989
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:25,210
-I didn't laugh at all.
-Me neither.

990
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,079
Who was it?

991
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,284
You laughed again.

992
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,319
-No way.
-You went "ha ha ha."

993
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:36,755
-He did.
-"Ha ha ha."

994
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,723
You have no recollection?

995
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,492
-He made a noise.
-I didn't notice.

996
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,627
-Let's take a look.
-Good idea.

997
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,263
The moment we restarted you went
"ha ha ha."

998
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,164
No way.

999
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,868
-Shall we eat?
-Yes.

1000
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:50,936
Thank you!

1001
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,704
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1002
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,105
Can you eat like Shimura?

1003
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,209
For that?

1004
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:01,146
-You clearly laughed. There's no doubt.
-That was a smile.

1005
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,514
You can't do that.

1006
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,750
-That's out, too?
-Of course it is.

1007
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,320
That's what this is.
That's the competition.

1008
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:12,557
-That's why we're here.
-I really wanted to have a good restart.

1009
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,193
-We can't even smile, right?
-Yeah.

1010
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,728
It was the same for Yamamoto.

1011
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,196
That's right.

1012
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,597
So...

1013
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,234
-You're out of chances.
-That's that.

1014
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,337
Sorry. It was my bad. Let's go.

1015
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:33,912
Well, that was a bit of a shock.
But that's what happens after a while.

1016
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,615
-You let your guard down.
-We mustn't forget that this is a battle.

1017
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,286
-We'd become a little too friendly.
-That's right.

1018
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,888
-We're not on the same team.
-We're enemies.

1019
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,825
-We can be friends again when it's over.
-Thank you.

1020
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,526
I think the watermelon did it.

1021
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:52,364
-It created a friendly atmosphere.
-That was Yamamoto's strategy.

1022
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,566
-It was his plan.
-You feel like friends.

1023
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,701
-Watermelon is fun.
-He planned this.

1024
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,204
-Watermelon tastes good.
-Can I have some?

1025
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,338
Let's eat.

1026
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,141
-Why don't we try that thing?
-Shimura-style eating.

1027
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,676
Do you think you can do it?

1028
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:05,977
He looks good at it.

1029
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:07,946
That piece looks good.

1030
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:11,182
-I've never done it before.
-You have to go quickly.

1031
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,785
-It's no easy feat.
-It's so fast.

1032
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,221
-Should we give him a countdown?
-Okay.

1033
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,991
Three. Two. One...

1034
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:21,359
Start.

1035
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,628
That's fast.

1036
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:24,829
Wow.

1037
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,998
Amazing.

1038
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:28,233
He stopped.

1039
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,771
-You couldn't do it?
-Nope.

1040
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,740
-It really is difficult.
-Shimura really is amazing.

1041
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,610
-He's so fast.
-He is really fast.

1042
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,311
What's wrong?

1043
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,650
Sushi fell out.

1044
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,385
Were you eating sushi?

1045
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,788
Which was it? Sushi or watermelon?

1046
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:51,790
Can you eat both at the same time?

1047
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,826
-They don't seem to match.
-There's blood in my mouth.

1048
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,261
Really?

1049
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,129
It's just watermelon, right?

1050
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:00,565
-You bit too hard?
-It's watermelon.

1051
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:02,767
It's just watermelon. It's watermelon red.

1052
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:03,902
It's the fruit.

1053
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,438
-Uh-oh.
-It's not blood. It's just juice.

1054
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:07,906
-It's fruit.
-Right?

1055
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,274
It's blood.

1056
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,142
-Blood?
-Seriously?

1057
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,111
-No, it's not.
-It's just fruit.

1058
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,113
-It's watermelon.
-It's full-on fruit.

1059
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,082
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1060
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,884
Can I look in your mouth?
I'll check for blood.

1061
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,354
This is gross.
Let me remove the watermelon first.

1062
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,024
Sorry about that.

1063
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,260
-He had that much inside?
-How can you do that?

1064
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:33,164
-You can put your hand in his mouth?
-I have to check if he's bleeding.

1065
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,699
-Is that pus?
-It's not pus.

1066
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,435
-Is it an ulcer? Pus?
-He didn't swallow any of it.

1067
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:39,471
Look, guys. He has a lot of fillings.

1068
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:41,906
Those are old.

1069
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,942
They're the old type of fillings.

1070
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,044
-Open up.
-I want to see.

1071
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,579
-You want a look, right?
-Yes.

1072
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:48,513
Open up, please.

1073
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,382
If a dentist saw that,
he'd take them all out.

1074
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:53,084
Look. Here.

1075
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,019
-Stop.
-They're white nowadays.

1076
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,121
This way.

1077
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,589
90% of them have fillings.

1078
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,126
What's this?

1079
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,460
What's going on?

1080
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,600
Look. Look closely.

1081
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,135
He's your senior.

1082
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,204
-Stop it.
  -What's he doing?

1083
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:14,606
Don't fight.

1084
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,875
-Where did this come from?
-This is not good.

1085
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,143
This is pro wrestling.

1086
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,544
My stomach hurts.

1087
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,379
Watch Akiyama.

1088
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:22,981
And Kasuga.

1089
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:23,982
Kasuga!

1090
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:26,050
-That was too strong.
  -He was close.

1091
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,286
-That was scary, actually.
  -He was close.

1092
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:30,822
-Quit getting into fights.
-Don't go too far.

1093
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:31,823
Sorry.

1094
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,459
We don't do violence,
and we don't waste food.

1095
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:37,128
-Look at all that food.
-We can't waste it.

1096
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,464
Who'll try that Shimura thing next?

1097
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:41,966
You should add "san" to his name.

1098
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,668
It's "Shimura-san."

1099
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:45,670
Or "Master Shimura."

1100
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:47,572
Or perhaps "Brother Shimura."

1101
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:50,141
-Let's eat the watermelon.
-Okay.

1102
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,043
-Go ahead.
-No, let's take turns.

1103
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,245
-You're the biggest guy.
-Akiyama, eat up.

1104
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:55,747
-Me?
-Yeah.

1105
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:56,948
Thank you.

1106
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:00,552
Can I have a big piece?
But firstly, I'll do this.

1107
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,156
I remove the rind first.

1108
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:06,758
You eat it like that?

1109
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:10,094
-Like you eat oranges.
-I've never seen that before.

1110
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,897
-I've done this since I was a child.
-It looks good.

1111
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,299
You can really go for it.

1112
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:15,733
It looks like meat.

1113
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,136
-It's like you're eating raw meat.
-Wow.

1114
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,904
-You're right.
-That looks tasty.

1115
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:20,972
That's cool.

1116
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:22,874
That's original.

1117
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,376
-It looks better without the rind.
-Yes, it's...

1118
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:28,379
You can eat quicker without the rind.

1119
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,448
I've never seen that done before.

1120
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,484
Can you take off the white part?
I don't like too much fat.

1121
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,652
Coming right up.

1122
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:37,155
Those are experienced hands.

1123
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:38,890
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

1124
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,124
Okay.

1125
00:47:41,593 --> 00:47:42,660
How cute.

1126
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,295
You have a button of a mouth.

1127
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,164
I have a tiny mouth.

1128
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,299
-Because it hurts?
-Exactly.

1129
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,567
It stings.

1130
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:50,935
Because you cut it.

1131
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,204
-Can I have your attention?
-Yes.

1132
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,574
-Can I say something?
-Yes.

1133
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,410
It's been a while but,

1134
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,747
I'm entering the R-1 competition.

1135
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,750
-Really?
-I haven't competed for six years.

1136
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:07,952
-Wow.
-That is amazing.

1137
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,954
I've come up with a plan.

1138
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,624
I'm thinking about stealing
Hey! Takuchan's act.

1139
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,960
-Is that okay?
-The act he does just with his chin?

1140
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:19,063
As long as Hey! Takuchan doesn't see it,
I should be safe.

1141
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,933
Well, that's a pretty famous act.

1142
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:24,702
If you make quite a few changes,
it could be okay.

1143
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,337
I'll do exactly the same thing.

1144
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,739
You can't do it anyway.

1145
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:29,474
I practiced. I can do it.

1146
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,511
-Would you mind showing us?
-It's quite a particular skill.

1147
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:36,781
-I'll do a bit.
-The voice and the jaw must be tough.

1148
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,783
-Come here.
-RG?

1149
00:48:40,852 --> 00:48:42,387
We're about to watch an act.

1150
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:43,554
-Whose?
-Mine.

1151
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:45,957
Sorry.

1152
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,559
-That was my bad timing.
-If we're ready.

1153
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,261
Hello, I am Hey! Takuchan.

1154
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,897
-You'll do it as Hey! Takuchan?
-You can't.

1155
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,766
-It's his name.
-Why not "Koba-chan"?

1156
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,467
Hello, I am Koba-chan.

1157
00:48:56,968 --> 00:49:01,072
Today I would like to show you
some of my "mouth impressions."

1158
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,274
-Mouth impressions?
-Let's get started.

1159
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:06,911
Hello.

1160
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,147
I'm Fujiwara.

1161
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,153
I would love to drink
the urine of a high school girl.

1162
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,824
-That's really like him.
-Next.

1163
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,730
See that girl walking up ahead?

1164
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:28,199
If all I did was tug on her braids,

1165
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,002
the police would let me off, right?

1166
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:35,640
That is impressive.

1167
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:37,975
But with the beard, the mouth's different.

1168
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,245
-You're right. The mouth is all wrong.
-He could've tried harder.

1169
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,683
Isn't my comedy partner edgy?

1170
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,987
I'm Hey! Takuchan. Thanks for listening.

1171
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,860
You looked exactly like them.

1172
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,196
I mean, you really chose good phrases.

1173
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,932
-He says things like that.
-They were probably quotes.

1174
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,333
He really did say them.

1175
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,937
-The only problem is the beard.
-Your mouth doesn't look like his.

1176
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,071
-Not at all.
-Yeah.

1177
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,573
Who is that supposed to be?

1178
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,808
Well, um...

1179
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,446
I was hoping this would turn out to
resemble someone.

1180
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,448
-You're still searching?
-Right.

1181
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,183
But it looks good.

1182
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:22,887
-And that wig is really good.
-Right?

1183
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:24,122
I really like it.

1184
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,323
Want a go?

1185
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,259
I don't think it will suit me.

1186
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,360
Try it.

1187
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:31,462
Why not?

1188
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,365
Thanks. Is this custom-made?

1189
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,700
It is.

1190
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,802
I wear it when I need a disguise.

1191
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,605
-You wear that often?
-Yeah.

1192
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,840
-You look like Keisuke Koide.
-Seriously?

1193
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,476
That's what he looks like
at movie premieres.

1194
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,746
I've never seen him at a movie premiere.
What's he like?

1195
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,916
They use movie premiere footage of him
in the news.

1196
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:54,886
-Act like you think he would.
-Just take a guess.

1197
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,189
Good evening.

1198
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,159
If you'd be kind enough to rub my back,

1199
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,127
I will settle down.

1200
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:05,696
So everyone, please,

1201
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,199
rub my back.

1202
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,536
-He'd never say that.
-What kind of movie is that?

1203
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,605
You said to take a guess.
You don't know either.

1204
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,241
He wouldn't talk about back rubs.

1205
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:18,776
Then where would he rub?

1206
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,545
I don't know where he rubs.

1207
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,613
I don't know where he rubs. But Koide...

1208
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:24,682
I do know?

1209
00:51:24,816 --> 00:51:26,184
What are you talking about?

1210
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:30,955
Your hair looks like Yuya Uchida.

1211
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:33,057
Seriously? That's pretty cool.

1212
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,726
Try doing a movie premiere as Yuya Uchida.

1213
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,698
-If you could rub my back--
-Again?

1214
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:43,367
-What kind of movie is that?
-What's your problem?

1215
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:44,769
Front-row person.

1216
00:51:44,836 --> 00:51:46,037
Front-row person?

1217
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,806
If he needs a back rub,
does that mean he's ill?

1218
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,007
Of course it does.

1219
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:55,046
-What are you eating?
-Mints.

1220
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,414
Want one?

1221
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,015
I'm fine.

1222
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,356
Now we just wait for the jelly to cool.

1223
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,460
-Does it look good?
-Yes. I put lots in this time.

1224
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,062
He gave me a pull tab...

1225
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,265
-This isn't refreshing.
-It is.

1226
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,201
It's dangerous.
I'll get a mouth like yours.

1227
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:18,536
It will be full of blood!

1228
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,304
If I put it in...

1229
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,608
If I chew this I'll bleed.

1230
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,210
You're being loud.
You have a big voice today!

1231
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,946
-You told me this was a mint.
-Nice loud voice.

1232
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:30,348
It's sharp. Touch this.

1233
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:31,649
Nice loud voice!

1234
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:34,385
Toos!

1235
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,286
Toos!

1236
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:41,726
Toos.

1237
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,494
-Toos!
-More!

1238
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,130
-Toos!
-More!

1239
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:48,232
-Toos.
-No!

1240
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,501
Toos!

1241
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:52,570
Yes, yes! That's it.

1242
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,508
-Why don't we clean up the watermelon?
-Good idea.

1243
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,377
We can't leave food out like this.

1244
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,679
-You're right.
-All this watermelon.

1245
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,447
You can keep your mints.

1246
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,116
I'll take a pee in the meantime.

1247
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,887
What should we do with the watermelon?

1248
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:13,424
This place is in quite a mess.

1249
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,860
-Where should we put this?
-The sink will do.

1250
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:17,395
Put this in the refrigerator.

1251
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,764
It looks like you've had
a lot of fun here.

1252
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,334
Wow.

1253
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:26,537
He laughed.

1254
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,439
Here?

1255
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,942
I got him!

1256
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:32,343
I got him!

1257
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,378
What happened?

1258
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,047
I did it!

1259
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:37,949
I heard a really loud laugh.

1260
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,417
He got me.

1261
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:41,586
Damn. I'm sorry.

1262
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,054
What happened?

1263
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,323
Well, it was the mints.

1264
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,258
He handed me the pull tab.

1265
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,595
I gave him something to repay the favor.

1266
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:52,463
It's a small curry.

1267
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:55,766
A tiny curry popped out.

1268
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,903
It's a tiny curry with rice.

1269
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,673
Kukky, I think you're in big trouble here.

1270
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:06,177
This is your second card.
Can I take another look?

1271
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:10,214
I'll have to look again and decide
whether this is a red or an orange.

1272
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:15,119
That's how much he laughed.

1273
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,090
It looks like you've had
a lot of fun here.

1274
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,062
That was incredible.

1275
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:25,963
No, no, no!

1276
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,165
-Incredible.
-No, no, no!

1277
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,101
No, no, no!

1278
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,403
No!

1279
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:33,704
Red!

1280
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,075
-He got it.
-That's it.

1281
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,685
-You're a zombie now.
-Oh, that's right.

1282
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,320
I forgot about that.

1283
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,756
-I'll do my best as a zombie.
-Be a good zombie.

1284
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,357
-Make everyone laugh.
-Okay.

1285
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:56,360
-So, are you ready to go?
-Yes.

1286
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,095
-I'm out.
-Later.

1287
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,130
Goodbye.

1288
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:00,665
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1289
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:02,566
-You did a great job.
-Sure did.

1290
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,635
I'm scared of his zombie already.

1291
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,604
No more counterattacks, Goto.

1292
00:55:07,238 --> 00:55:09,707
But you know, he got me first.

1293
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,810
The timing was right and
I had just the right item.

1294
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,312
Goto was my weak point?

1295
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:17,982
Goto's an offense player, actually.

1296
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,719
He was the funny guy in his previous duo.

1297
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,821
He's good at being stupid, too.

1298
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,730
When you think about it,
he really is an all-round player.

1299
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,732
Damn.

1300
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,868
Goto was the one
I needed to watch out for.

1301
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,604
-I can't keep focused.
-Me, too.

1302
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,540
-Two hours have passed.
-Danger time.

1303
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:45,142
Is that all my concentration lasts for?

1304
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,211
Two hours might be my limit.

1305
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,513
I'm getting tired.

1306
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,116
That's not good.

1307
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:53,317
Start.

1308
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:55,286
-Watch out. You have a card.
-Four hours to go.

1309
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,855
It's too early to change your batteries.

1310
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:00,191
-Who wants cola?
-Anybody?

1311
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:01,292
Me.

1312
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:02,359
You want some?

1313
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:03,961
I'll have some.

1314
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,229
There's alcohol, too.

1315
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,698
Quit that already.

1316
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,468
-Enough with the jelly.
-I'm cooling it now.

1317
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:13,437
Who's in charge here?

1318
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,477
I can't even tell how much of a mess
you've made yet.

1319
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,011
I just got here.

1320
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,414
Who's running this?

1321
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,717
Who gave you permission
to make such a mess?

1322
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,752
Me.

1323
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:31,255
-It was him.
-He's in charge.

1324
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,024
I can't rent it out looking like this.

1325
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,359
Sorry.

1326
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:37,962
-We're on a training camp.
-Sorry.

1327
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:41,966
Nobody told me that you would be making
this much of a mess.

1328
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:43,334
Sorry.

1329
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:44,702
Right?

1330
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,070
However...

1331
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:50,241
You can come here and have your fun.
I don't mind that.

1332
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:53,377
But don't you think this mess
is going too far?

1333
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,512
You're right.

1334
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:55,513
Can I say--

1335
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,582
That wasn't in the contract, was it?

1336
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,518
We went a little far. Sorry.

1337
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,653
Right? You came here for your fun.

1338
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,388
But you can't...

1339
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:07,925
There's no... This is too much.
And it shouldn't be!

1340
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:09,960
-Understood.
-Sorry.

1341
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,495
Sorry.

1342
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,130
You've heard of manners.

1343
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:16,534
You have to use this place
within the boundaries of the rules.

1344
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,035
I'm a fan of yours.

1345
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:18,936
We're sorry.

1346
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,739
We only did this because you said
you wouldn't be here.

1347
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:25,109
Does it suddenly become okay
to create chaos when I'm away?

1348
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,244
-Of course not. Right?
-You're right.

1349
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,547
After all, the agreement was...

1350
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,583
I signed the lease because you said
you'd be tidy.

1351
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,655
I can't rent it to people
who make such a mess.

1352
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:40,624
-Who is that?
-I'd like to share a life hack.

1353
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,526
-Kinoshita?
-"How to peel boiled eggs."

1354
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:45,229
I have no interest in
how to peel boiled eggs!

1355
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:49,266
Why must I learn about peeling boiled eggs
from the likes of you?

1356
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,802
Sorry I'm late. Excuse me. I apologize.

1357
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,510
I don't need your apologies.
Shu-chan, this isn't what we agreed to.

1358
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,714
What's going on?

1359
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,082
Where's this going?

1360
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,388
Ocean View!

1361
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:13,691
Ocean View!

1362
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,025
It takes all types.

1363
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,493
We're sorry.

1364
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:17,795
-Right?
-We are.

1365
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,897
That was close.

1366
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:22,266
I am Ocean View.

1367
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,567
That sure was close.

1368
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:24,568
I'm Ocean View.

1369
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,971
-I'm Ocean View.
-I am the real Ocean View!

1370
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,206
-Ocean View.
-Ocean View!

1371
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:34,011
Falling country people!

1372
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,322
Who broke this?

1373
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,694
-What's this?
-Are you okay?

1374
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,296
F-CK
DIE, STUPID!!

1375
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,697
This means trouble.

1376
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:55,699
Who did this?

1377
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,301
That's wrong.

1378
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,771
-I left it in the changing room.
-Right.

1379
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:02,573
It was Kasuga, right?

1380
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,476
-Sorry?
-You were in there for ages.

1381
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,278
It was him?

1382
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:11,382
-It wasn't me.
-It has the word "die."

1383
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:15,085
-I didn't do it. Why would I?
-You can't write that.

1384
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,720
-That's awful.
-That's so wrong.

1385
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:17,821
That's wrong.

1386
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,758
-A girl did it. There's a heart.
-No girls are here.

1387
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:23,494
-If it's a girl, there's only one suspect.
-Who is it?

1388
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,162
He's a she.

1389
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,499
She's a dyke.

1390
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:30,701
Was it you?

1391
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:31,835
Yes.

1392
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:33,737
That was wrong of you.

1393
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:35,806
Well, she is a girl.

1394
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,610
-Why did you do it?
-Why did you take it out on a mirror?

1395
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:41,211
Well, she is a girl.

1396
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,913
He isn't a girl. Come on.

1397
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:44,181
I am a girl.

1398
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,416
She's transgender.

1399
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,917
Show us.

1400
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,419
Show what?

1401
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,586
Proof.

1402
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:00,364
-That's not quite...
-How is that proof?

1403
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:04,134
-We can't tell from just that.
-We can't tell if you're a woman or not.

1404
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,240
-We can't tell.
-Nope.

1405
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:12,743
Show us properly.

1406
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,153
-Show your breasts.
-Why must I show my breasts?

1407
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,460
-One level higher.
-That's not enough.

1408
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:32,096
One more try.

1409
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,584
-Who was it?
-I don't know.

1410
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,486
Who was it?

1411
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,388
-Kinoshita?
-Who was it?

1412
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:58,655
I didn't laugh.

1413
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,359
-You laughed.
-No, I didn't. Not me.

1414
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,062
-I didn't laugh.
-I didn't laugh either.

1415
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,663
Maybe he laughed at himself.

1416
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,265
Did you laugh at yourself?

1417
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:09,433
That smile?

1418
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,435
-Probably.
-That's got to be it!

1419
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,537
-That's it.
-Your final "hmph!"

1420
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:20,310
-Date.
-Perfect!

1421
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,280
Let's take a look.

1422
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,687
You're already out there.

1423
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:32,890
You're out and...

1424
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,258
There.

1425
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:35,959
No, no.

1426
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,661
-That's out.
-You smiled.

1427
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,229
But I wasn't laughing.

1428
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:40,597
That's a laugh.

1429
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:42,933
If you want to be precise,
you laughed twice.

1430
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:44,701
Date.

1431
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:45,769
Red card!

1432
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:48,338
That's harsh.

1433
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:55,446
I couldn't make that face.

1434
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:57,748
To the zombie room.

1435
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,117
That's all you can do.

1436
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:04,054
But I nearly laughed at your T-shirt.
It has so many different helmets.

1437
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:06,757
I nearly laughed at
all those helmets, too.

1438
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:08,659
What is with that T-shirt?

1439
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,994
-So many helmets.
-It's nice.

1440
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,363
Why should I have to say,
"So many helmets"?

1441
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,200
I didn't buy it for the helmets.

1442
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,335
That must be disappointing.

1443
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,771
-It's not as though I laughed.
-We feel for you.

1444
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:23,207
-Take that frustration out as a zombie.
-Okay.

1445
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,708
-Let's go.
-We feel for you.

1446
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:27,277
-I almost laughed at your nipples.
-That was close.

1447
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:31,081
It's like your brain starts going crazy.

1448
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:39,690
They didn't laugh at the things
they usually laugh at.

1449
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,127
I couldn't laugh at
what I found funny either.

1450
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:45,462
It's like,
you really do start going crazy.

1451
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:55,372
This really is quite tough.

1452
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:58,809
All I did was show a nipple and go "hmph."

1453
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,344
-This was out?
-That's right.

1454
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,979
No "hmphs."

1455
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,583
Hey, that's not enough hot water.

1456
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:14,124
Can you let me leave
a tiny bit of chocolate?

1457
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:15,025
No?

1458
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,293
He said no!

1459
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,769
I'm going to see how this tastes.

1460
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:37,981
What an idiot.

1461
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,317
He is an idiot.
