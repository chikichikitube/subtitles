00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:22,523
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,028
Well, I thought
that I should bring something.

4
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:33,033
So on my day off, I searched through
the Tokyu Hands store from top to bottom.

5
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,703
I looked all over.

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,805
"Why did I buy this?"

7
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,542
I bought a couple of things
that left me thinking that.

8
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,746
That's how much this screws
with the heads of us comedians.

9
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,448
This damn project.

10
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,950
Everyone's a professional.

11
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,786
When it comes to what's funny,

12
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,122
everyone's already seen it,
and thought of it, themselves.

13
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,724
Right?

14
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,195
"Why would you do something so unfunny
  at a time like this?"

15
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:05,299
"Why would you ruin the atmosphere
  like that for us?"

16
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:09,036
I think they have a better chance
if I'm left thinking that.

17
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,072
That's what I'll laugh at.

18
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,674
But you can't...

19
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,344
There's no... This is too much.
And it shouldn't be!

20
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,480
-Understood.
-Sorry.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,714
Sorry.

22
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:25,019
We can take everyone out at once,
in one clean hit, can't we?

23
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,222
I think we might see that this time.

24
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,925
That just might happen.

25
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,927
PLAYERS DEFEATED SO FAR: KUKKY

26
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,562
You've had a lot of fun here.

27
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,132
Wow.

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,135
Red!

29
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,372
PLAYERS DEFEATED SO FAR: MIKIO DATE

30
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:58,946
Date.

31
00:02:59,013 --> 00:02:59,947
Red card!

32
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,616
That's harsh.

33
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,126
It's time to restart.

34
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,829
-We have bread.
-Yeah, I'm getting a little hungry.

35
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,699
-I need some stamina.
-I'll have some, too.

36
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,734
-Which bread?
-Is bread enough?

37
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,469
Do you have to hide your nipples?

38
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,839
-I'm shy about them.
-About your nipples? Why?

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,441
I don't want them hanging out.

40
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,077
-Kobayashi hasn't laughed yet, right?
-That's right.

41
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,579
I haven't laughed at all.

42
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,982
None of them have even come close.

43
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,318
-Nothing has come close?
-Nothing.

44
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:42,323
You keep positioning yourself in places
where nobody else goes.

45
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:43,657
That's not true.

46
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,359
-Toos!
-Toos!

47
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,328
-I'm coming.
-Sit down!

48
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,030
Hang on.
Am I the only one without any cards?

49
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,067
-I don't have any either.
-Me neither.

50
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,735
-You have one.
-Really?

51
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,669
You do.

52
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,304
-I just yelled.
-Really?

53
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,006
I just went "weh weh."

54
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,275
-Only I got a card that time.
-That's right.

55
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,943
Is Kasuga card-free, too?

56
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,446
-The Kasuga doesn't have any yet.
-The Kasuga?

57
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,263
How do you fold these again?

58
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,401
Oh, I remember. Like this.

59
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,236
You're  tsuru-tsuru.

60
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,804
Brings back memories, right?

61
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,673
-Not you.
-I wasn't talking to you.

62
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,222
-That has to be out.
-No doubt about it.

63
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,823
No way.

64
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,992
That wasn't right. We need an inquiry.

65
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,328
-Why do we need an inquiry?
-About what?

66
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,663
An inquiry into what?

67
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,731
Hey! Quit screwing around!

68
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,734
-I was just folding a paper crane  tsuru.
-A  tsuru?

69
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,636
Do such coincidences really happen?

70
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,837
That was Goto.

71
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,408
But I have absolutely no idea
what you laughed at.

72
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,143
Please have a look at that.

73
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,780
I said Kasuga's skin
was smooth,  "tsuru-tsuru,"

74
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,215
when Iwahashi was making
a paper crane,  "tsuru."

75
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,517
A  tsuru and  tsuru-tsuru.

76
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,855
-You seemed perfectly fine here.
  -I was perfectly fine.

77
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:23,957
You're  tsuru-tsuru.

78
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,526
Brings back memories, right?

79
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,394
-Not you.
-I wasn't talking to you.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,968
That was amazing.

81
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,937
That was amazing!

82
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,106
-That was like a miracle.
-Let me see...

83
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,443
-I was going to give you a red card.
-Please don't.

84
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,878
Please, wait.
I don't think that deserves red.

85
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,814
I'll give you an orange card.

86
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,218
I have never seen such a coincidence
in my entire life.

87
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,420
What were the chances of that?

88
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,956
-This is scary.
-I'm lucky I didn't notice.

89
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,992
That was so funny. It was a close one.

90
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,170
-I really need to eat something.
-Me, too.

91
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,140
-Should I make something?
-Who's a good cook?

92
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,842
Who can cook?

93
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,844
There is a ton of konjac here.

94
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,546
-Both normal konjac and konjac jelly.
-There is.

95
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,282
-Kasuga, continue on with that thing.
-What thing?

96
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,885
-Where you had the tip of it hanging out.
-The tip?

97
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,491
-Look at that muscle.
-He's tight.

98
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,127
-That's a beautiful body.
-His butt is all muscle.

99
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,261
Beautiful.

100
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,496
Like this?

101
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,364
Wow.

102
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,999
He's using that?

103
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,200
That's a lot of skin.

104
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,637
-Is that just foreskin?
-Yes. It's just skin.

105
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,607
-That's a lot of skin.
-It's long.

106
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,675
Did you work on enlarging that?

107
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,344
No, I didn't work on it.

108
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,813
How can you eat that right now?

109
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,548
I'm totally fine.

110
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,849
-Really?
-Totally.

111
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,652
-Try eating it up close.
-That's no problem at all.

112
00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,853
Get really close.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,889
I am fine with this sort of thing.

114
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,324
How can you eat that while looking at him?

115
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,729
Kasuga, turn around.

116
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,230
How can he eat that?

117
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,534
Give it a lick.

118
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,136
I'm not going to lick it. Why say that?

119
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,474
-You sure have a lot of skin leftover.
-Can I try that?

120
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,609
-Sure.
-Let's do it together.

121
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,311
Show us.

122
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,583
How can they do that?

123
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,119
That is amazing. That is no easy feat.

124
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,290
-That's brave. Look at them.
-They're so mentally strong.

125
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,625
Amazing.

126
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,962
-That's even more similar.
-What is it?

127
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,364
-A pickled plum.
-What will you do with that?

128
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,935
-You can do this?
-Yes. They are two different things.

129
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,403
They're so close.

130
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,439
He's gone downstairs.
It looks like his balls.

131
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,617
-Akiyama?
-It's Akiyama.

132
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,919
That had to be Akiyama.

133
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,089
-He came and laughed all by himself.
-What was that?

134
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,357
His privates were...

135
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,993
I lost it the moment
he flashed his privates.

136
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,829
-I thought I'd be okay.
-But not when you got up close.

137
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,866
But I'm usually okay.
I'm totally fine with stuff like that.

138
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,435
That's the worse thing to do.
You came by yourself.

139
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,137
I'm fine with these things.
I wasn't worried.

140
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,873
I'm okay with these things.

141
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,042
But his foreskin was even more impressive
than I imagined.

142
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,377
Akiyama.

143
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,079
It's his first card.

144
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,682
-Yellow.
-Right. I totally deserve it.

145
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,293
Akiyama?

146
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,397
He jumped into that by himself.
I take such efforts into consideration.

147
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,033
-You need to earn points like that.
-Damn.

148
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,102
But be careful. Jumping in can backfire.

149
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,272
-It was a nice aggressive approach.
-It was good offense.

150
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,541
-You've really been on the offense, too.
-Really? Thank you.

151
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,210
But you have zero points.

152
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,513
That means I'm not funny at all.

153
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,153
-I couldn't handle that.
-I had no problem.

154
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,421
You were so close.

155
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,524
-Can you show us again before the restart?
-Before we start.

156
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,726
-You don't want to see that.
-All of it?

157
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,028
-Before we start.
-Okay.

158
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,429
Let's laugh at it once.

159
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,002
-That is crazy.
-What is that?

160
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,972
-Do you actually have meat in there?
-Of course I do.

161
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,640
-Show us again.
-Where is it?

162
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,908
It's right here.

163
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,747
Kobayashi laughed, right?

164
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:41,815
I didn't laugh.

165
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,951
-It's Kobayashi.
-That was definitely you.

166
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,485
-We started?
-I didn't laugh.

167
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,554
-It was definitely you.
-I didn't laugh.

168
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,523
That was Kobayashi, right?

169
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,258
That was definitely him.

170
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,359
He looked down.

171
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,461
-RG laughed, too.
-Look at him.

172
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,163
-It's RG!
-I heard a laugh.

173
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,332
-He laughed first.
-I heard RG's voice.

174
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,967
-Not Kobayashi?
-Me?

175
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,935
-I heard RG's voice.
-He guffawed.

176
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,003
But...

177
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,571
To be honest,

178
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,873
it was Kobayashi.

179
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,609
However, what's the story with RG?

180
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,179
-I heard a voice. It was a laugh.
-Really?

181
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,814
-He sprayed a laugh.
-No, no.

182
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,283
-We'll have to look into that.
-I'm not sure.

183
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,086
It's hard to tell
whether Kobayashi actually laughed.

184
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,989
-I almost laughed, but I held onto it.
-No, Koba was...

185
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,256
Let's have another look.

186
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,192
Should we look at Kobayashi first?

187
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,295
-Show us again.
-Where is it?

188
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,629
It's right here.

189
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,968
-He's smiling.
  -That's a laugh, right?

190
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,338
But that sound. That "bu-bu-bu."
I didn't make it.

191
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,506
Really? Who was it?

192
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,907
Maybe that was RG.

193
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,776
-Me?
-Can we see RG?

194
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,212
-Show us again.
-Where is it?

195
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,546
It's right here.

196
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:51,818
See?

197
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,020
I did it.

198
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,088
-He laughed more than Kobayashi.
-He did.

199
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,623
-You're right!
-Yes.

200
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,191
Which means RG gets

201
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,526
a red card.

202
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,095
RG, red card!

203
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,897
Scary!

204
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,000
-Kobayashi, yellow card!
-Okay. I accept that.

205
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,841
That got Kasuga quite a few points.

206
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,478
-That does deserve points.
-But RG went on the offense so much.

207
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,579
Yay.

208
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,149
Now he's leaving, he's a sorry sight.

209
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,318
-You're a zombie now.
-RG's zombie will be quite a threat.

210
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,788
That's true. RG's zombie will be scary.

211
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,191
-I can try a lot more tricks.
-These zombies are scary.

212
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,695
I only got to do one-third...
Only one-quarter of what I prepared.

213
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,864
I brought a lot more props.

214
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,901
There were so many more things
that I wanted to try.

215
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,171
But when somebody shows you

216
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,907
a dick like that...

217
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,075
It's right here.

218
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,845
That was a dirty move from Kasuga.

219
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,748
Kasuga hadn't been on the offense much.

220
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,551
You could even say he was
running away from the fight.

221
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,486
But he came back in a big way.

222
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:04,257
That's an important lesson.
That's how it is in show business.

223
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,794
How far can you stretch it?

224
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,296
-The tip?
-The skin.

225
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,464
The skin. Well...

226
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,668
-Wow!
-Amazing.

227
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,236
Try putting this inside.

228
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,171
-See? It stretches.
-Even more!

229
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,209
-Can you put the toy curry in there?
-Inside.

230
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,277
-This curry.
-Inside my skin?

231
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,781
I don't think that it will fit inside.
Just a minute.

232
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:28,715
That was amazing.

233
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,017
-But I think that will fit, actually.
-Right?

234
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,553
It does fit.

235
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:34,821
What is it?

236
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,156
It went in.

237
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,591
Let go.

238
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,597
I got him!

239
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,765
-Oh, my.
-He's in trouble.

240
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:46,967
That was...

241
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,102
-That was too much.
-That was...

242
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,605
-That was a full-on laugh.
-It was.

243
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,106
No doubt about it.

244
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,207
A full-blown laugh.

245
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,977
That really was too much.

246
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,979
It came out like, "Here you go."

247
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,580
-Nice and slow.
-Yeah.

248
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,849
Why did it come out at that speed?

249
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,286
It was like one of those drawers
that slowly slides out by itself.

250
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,425
We need to look at a number of things.

251
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,860
Firstly, Kobayashi.

252
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,295
But Mr. Matsumoto...

253
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,964
Can you please look at how fast
it comes out?

254
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,133
A bowl of curry rice will come out.

255
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,302
Here.

256
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,471
It fits inside. Without a problem.

257
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,872
-It's curry rice.
-He's...

258
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:28,909
That's too much.

259
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,112
Nobody can keep a straight face at that!

260
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,681
-You have to laugh, right?
-That was so unfair.

261
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,716
Let's take another look.

262
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,519
Let go.

263
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,195
However, Kasuga was laughing, too.

264
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,096
I was?

265
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,132
Let go.

266
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,637
I got him.

267
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:58,638
Oh, my.

268
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,508
-Didn't Kobayashi laugh first?
-No, no.

269
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,910
-You were laughing as it came out.
-As it came.

270
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,512
-For real?
-That's tough.

271
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,414
That can happen, too.

272
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,850
So, Kobayashi gets an orange card.

273
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,587
That's right.

274
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,422
And Kasuga gets

275
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,290
a yellow card.

276
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,125
-I'm on yellow now?
-It's his first.

277
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,996
However, it's not just a yellow card.
You scored a point, too.

278
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:24,764
Okay.

279
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,832
But that was too much.

280
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,635
When you get served curry at that speed...

281
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,772
I was wondering which would come first.
The rice, or the curry.

282
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,345
Thank you.

283
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,449
-We're in trouble.
-Yeah, we are in trouble.

284
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,252
I'd like you all to look at it
as closely as I did.

285
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,654
That's fine with me.
I can look at it close up.

286
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,422
But no matter how funny it is...

287
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,492
If you get close enough,
it looks like it's in slow motion.

288
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,728
Goto can choose which food goes inside.

289
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,930
Kasuga, how is the condition of your skin?

290
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,298
I'm ready when you are.

291
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,506
Will this fit?

292
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,842
That's a bit...

293
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,845
But I'll give it a try.
I hadn't done curry before either.

294
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,179
Of course not.

295
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,082
Let's stand where we'll each have
an equal view.

296
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,218
-Okay.
-Should I go over there?

297
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,253
Wherever you want.

298
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,922
But it's not fair.
Goto knows which food is inside.

299
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,225
-That's true.
-It won't be as funny.

300
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,294
-But he doesn't know its speed.
-Hang on.

301
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:28,962
This is intense.

302
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,498
Let's survive this.

303
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,802
We survived the curry.

304
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,004
I wonder...

305
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,607
-What does that mean?
-Are you in bad shape?

306
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,008
No, I just...

307
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,576
Maybe I should do it there.

308
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,778
-Go for it.
-Okay.

309
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,913
-All together.
-I'm not sure about this.

310
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,950
I may not be able to recreate that speed.

311
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,086
-It's already inside.
-It is?

312
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,488
I've got a front row seat.

313
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,258
It's completely inside.

314
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,361
-It's inside. What is it?
-There are corners.

315
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,329
What is that?

316
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,563
Let it out.

317
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,998
I'm not sure...

318
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,734
Okay. Here I go. I'm letting go now.

319
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,938
Huh?

320
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,141
Nothing is coming out.

321
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,509
Goto is close.

322
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,381
-It got stuck.
-It's stuck!

323
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,150
Akiyama is in trouble, too.

324
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,822
I don't know where to flex.

325
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,159
Because I already let go,
I can't touch it anymore.

326
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,764
Where should I flex?

327
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,400
Look at Akiyama.

328
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,973
-This is impossible.
-No damn way!

329
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,008
-That was so funny.
-That's not fair.

330
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,243
What is this?

331
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,945
Hey. Wait a minute.

332
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,847
That was too much.

333
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,282
It is impossible not to laugh.

334
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,219
But seriously. This is wrong.

335
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,754
Well...

336
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:05,158
To be honest,
nearly all of you were laughing.

337
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,760
No, no.

338
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,461
-I didn't laugh.
-I held it back.

339
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,431
But if we go down there,
there will be no end.

340
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,067
So, the guy who stood out the most is out.
Akiyama.

341
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,372
The thing is,
I held onto it the whole time.

342
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,308
But then he started clenching
his whole body.

343
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:26,079
-It wouldn't come out.
-Nobody guessed it wouldn't come out.

344
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,481
Then he tried to push it out
using his muscles.

345
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,250
Then an eel bento popped out!

346
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,719
Where should I flex?

347
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,558
Wait. Please.

348
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,193
That's not fair.

349
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,228
After all, an eel bento came out.

350
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,798
-It's impossible.
-He definitely laughed.

351
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,099
Akiyama.

352
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,167
Orange card.

353
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,405
-Seriously.
-We have to quit doing that.

354
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,506
He's right.

355
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,475
Shall we just do two more turns?

356
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,311
In the end,
Kasuga's points just keep on piling up.

357
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,946
-Yay.
-That's amazing.

358
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,815
-Thank you.
-What a powerful weapon.

359
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,786
Okay.

360
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,090
-Let's change the line of attack.
-All right.

361
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,493
-That was wrong.
-We're tired of seeing dicks.

362
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,433
This sure shoots out a lot of water.

363
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,869
Is that a wet wipe?

364
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,138
Goto even comments on things like that?

365
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,341
He even talks about
how the water comes out.

366
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,737
Your first try was amazing.

367
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,305
I could do it at the start.

368
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,978
What a sound.

369
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,747
-That was like The Drifters' jingle.
-Way to go.

370
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,693
You're incredible.

371
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,597
-He's getting better and better.
-You're improving.

372
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,500
-That's amazing.
-What are you using this time for?

373
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,202
Wow! I'm such a quick learner!

374
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,105
This isn't the time
for practicing the trumpet.

375
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,947
I don't get him.

376
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,486
My brain feels stiff.
I'm going to do a Rubik's cube.

377
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,855
I'll boil this.

378
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,757
I'll boil something.

379
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,759
Pasta?

380
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,961
-It has to boil first.
-I think it's...

381
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,864
Hey, that's not enough hot water.

382
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,202
Kinoshita sure likes that sort of thing.

383
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,117
What's with this?

384
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,655
Are you okay?

385
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,490
Say goodbye to him.

386
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,125
Sure.

387
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,264
He looked after you, right?

388
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,232
You're in his debt, right?

389
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,302
I don't know about that.

390
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,373
Sorry, but...

391
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,175
Who is that?

392
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,347
Is the deceased your son?

393
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,951
He's my son.

394
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,189
You owe him. Right, Iwahashi?

395
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:58,591
Yes.

396
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:03,896
Who else owes him?

397
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,667
Really?

398
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,412
-He's in heaven now.
-Okay.

399
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,248
Would you like to share a few words?

400
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,083
-You owe him.
-Sure.

401
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,324
Before your untimely passing,

402
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:36,195
you always invited me to join you,
as unworthy as I was.

403
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,799
You always provided me with women.
Thank you.

404
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,536
He's listening. I'm sure of it.

405
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,672
Iwahashi, would you like a word?

406
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,040
Yes.

407
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,108
Well...

408
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,088
Falling country people.

409
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,427
Falling country people.

410
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:09,996
Anti-bacterial plastic case.

411
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,331
Shirokane birthday party.

412
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:13,933
Le couple.

413
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,702
Aung San Suu Kyi suit.

414
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,704
Justin Bieber party.

415
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,272
What are you talking about?

416
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,274
Aren't you saying goodbye?

417
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,643
-Thanks.
-Say bye Japan.

418
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,144
Destiny.

419
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,913
My girl collection.

420
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,581
Traffic information.

421
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,016
-V-shot.
-That's enough.

422
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,517
-I said enough!
-What's wrong?

423
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,286
Aung San Suu Kyi. Keep on jumping.

424
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,787
Get away. Get away.

425
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,055
Just away.

426
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,191
Fine!

427
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,492
Fine.

428
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,030
He is such an idiot.

429
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,900
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

430
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,502
Sorry about that.

431
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,872
Okay!

432
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,383
This bit's a great one.

433
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:07,620
Here it comes.

434
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,021
Let me taste this.

435
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,927
I'm going to see how this tastes.

436
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,573
I wonder.

437
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,009
Goto, how do you like your noodles?

438
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,846
-What?
-Your noodles...

439
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,553
How do you like them?

440
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,956
-I like them al dente.
-What an idiot.

441
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,892
He's such an idiot.

442
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,960
-You don't like them too soft?
-Yeah.

443
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,386
You must have been hungry, Umemiya-san.

444
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,488
You're right.

445
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,657
But I really love seafood.

446
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,530
There's not much here, unfortunately.

447
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,536
You had a stern face there.

448
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:34,173
When you impersonate Umemiya,
you get a stern expression.

449
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,741
Yes, I do.

450
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,011
You have to get into character, right?

451
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:39,946
Yes.

452
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,182
You must be full.

453
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,320
-I'm thirsty, actually.
-Watching you eat has made me hungry, too.

454
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,021
-That happens, right?
-Yeah.

455
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,492
You are so noisy.

456
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,234
I have to bite it off on the line.

457
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,501
As close as I can.

458
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,137
I have to bite as close to the line
as possible.

459
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,740
I was a little off!

460
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,110
The devil told me to try again!

461
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,913
I have to bite right on the line.

462
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,648
With my teeth. On the border.

463
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,216
Just my teeth. On the line.

464
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,452
I went too far!

465
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,754
The devil's telling me to do it!

466
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,957
I will bite this exact spot
with my front teeth.

467
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,927
Right here. With my teeth.
Without sliding. A clean bite.

468
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:30,730
There's still chocolate!

469
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,864
Shut up.

470
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,333
The devil keeps talking!
Let me try to negotiate!

471
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,568
Please wait, Devil!

472
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:38,738
Can you be a bit softer on me?
The current rules are too tough.

473
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,106
Let's make a compromise.

474
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,608
Can you let me leave
a tiny bit of chocolate?

475
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:43,509
No?

476
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,577
He said no!

477
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,290
Look at Kasuga.

478
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,560
Do that properly.

479
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,164
-Give it to me.
-Really?

480
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:11,604
-It shouldn't be that difficult.
-You aligned the plus with the plus!

481
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,572
Your duo is "Plus Minus," right?

482
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,826
Feel the way my muscles move!

483
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,494
This is full power!

484
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,331
My shoulder fell out. I'm gonna shrug.
That hurts!

485
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,078
Why can't Plus Minus align
the plus-minus properly?

486
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,580
You, of all people,
should have no problems.

487
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,748
That's true.

488
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:59,218
He had the plus with the plus.
The little bits that stick out.

489
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,853
We had a fight yesterday!

490
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,188
Who cares?

491
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,356
With your partner?

492
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,490
About what?

493
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,891
About our comedy act.

494
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,194
Well, since he's not here...

495
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,030
A man who stops the Yurikamome train

496
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,036
You stop conversations.

497
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,608
You fought with your partner?
That's what duos do.

498
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:25,911
Even Kinoshita has fights.
He's been around longer. It happens.

499
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,880
But you don't fight anymore, right?

500
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:28,914
Of course we do.

501
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,583
What do you fight about?

502
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,184
Well, you know.

503
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,787
Our most recent fight was...

504
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,889
Um...

505
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,494
You guys don't fight.

506
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,129
No...

507
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,536
-He has nothing to tell.
-You don't have to pretend that you fight.

508
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:52,805
No, we do.

509
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,377
But I guess that wasn't really a fight.

510
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,248
You don't have to get that specific.

511
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,286
Well, one day

512
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,657
I went on one of those
entertainment news shows.

513
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:16,829
Then on a different show that he was on,
he referred to a comment that I had made,

514
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,231
and he made fun of me.

515
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,137
How pathetic.

516
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,006
He's brutal.

517
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,407
What a pathetic story.

518
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,112
He really made fun of me.

519
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,147
Wasn't that pathetic?

520
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,882
I don't think "pathetic" is...

521
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,356
Who's this?

522
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,239
What's this? You made pasta?

523
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,342
It's nothing special. Would you like some?

524
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,276
Eat up.

525
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,711
You want me to?

526
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,713
Okay.

527
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,115
Thank you.

528
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,160
You've become a great cook.

529
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:22,595
Thank you.

530
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,565
Who is it?

531
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,671
Nice to meet you all.

532
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,473
I am Yuriko Koike.

533
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:35,508
Thanks.

534
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,178
Did you all vote for me?

535
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,218
I'll be wearing "Koike Green" all the way.

536
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,787
-Are you Yuriko Koike?
-Yes.

537
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:51,991
-The governor of Tokyo?
-Yeah.

538
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,528
-Are you moving the markets to Toyosu?
-Not anymore.

539
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,198
-I thought you had settled on Toyosu.
-Yeah.

540
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,767
I changed it again. Keep up the support.

541
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,670
-Really? Where will it go?
-Jakuzure.

542
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,405
Keep up the support.

543
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,442
Come on.

544
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,745
He laughed.

545
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:16,615
Why would you build a fish market there?
Jakuzure? I don't think so.

546
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:19,451
-No! Damn it!
-Why build it in Jakuzure?

547
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,954
-Near the underpass?
-Damn it!

548
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,923
I shouldn't have asked him!

549
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,793
-It's your fault for asking.
-That was a clean hit.

550
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,461
That was a fair and honest duel.

551
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,130
It cut straight to the bone.

552
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,899
This sucks. No way!

553
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,634
Goto, red card!

554
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,012
-For real?
-That was a nice counter-attack.

555
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,783
-I thought you had settled on Toyosu.
-Yeah.

556
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,385
I changed it again. Keep up the support.

557
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,255
-Really? Where will it go?
-Jakuzure.

558
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,560
Really?

559
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,963
A million yen?

560
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,164
You're out.

561
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,599
Nothing can be done.

562
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,770
-Let's go to the zombie room.
-Oh, that's right.

563
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,442
Damn! Couldn't I have held it in?
No, that was impossible.

564
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,512
That was disappointing.

565
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,981
He got me.

566
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,484
That space really drives you crazy.

567
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,153
It's pure chaos in there.

568
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,289
That was one million yen!

569
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,992
Of course, I'm sad about the million yen,

570
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,194
but on top of that,

571
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,131
I wanted to see the view in that room
a few hours from now.

572
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,970
Let's go.

573
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:50,709
Are we on?

574
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,244
We are.

575
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,147
Are we halfway there?

576
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,217
-Half of the time has passed.
-I mean the number of people.

577
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,318
Oh, that too.

578
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,153
Exactly half.

579
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,990
Having watched the show,
things get really tough from here.

580
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,025
It's tough.

581
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,541
He's not welcome.

582
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,508
Let's do it.

583
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:57,843
-Sorry?
-Let's do it.

584
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:00,979
How annoying.

585
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,047
Okay.

586
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,350
No one is watching them either.

587
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,354
They're almost all alone.

588
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,056
Who's going to laugh?

589
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,333
Everyone is over here.

590
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,593
That is going to hurt.

591
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,697
That's draining and painful.

592
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:52,731
Ouch.

593
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,669
-Ouch.
-Ouch.

594
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,674
He's all red.

595
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,819
-They're still going.
-That has to hurt.

596
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,193
Stop it!

597
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,196
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

598
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,233
Stop it! Stop it!

599
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:33,739
I may be in trouble.

600
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,610
Who was it? This is bad. Damn.

601
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,313
Was it me?

602
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,182
Did anybody else laugh?

603
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,650
-I didn't.
-I didn't laugh.

604
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:45,851
Damn.

605
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:48,720
Do you have a card?

606
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,290
-I have one.
-You do?

607
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,526
-Yes. I laughed at myself.
-That's right.

608
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:55,761
This is bad.

609
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,496
Kasuga.

610
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,699
I couldn't hold it in.

611
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,668
Which means you get an orange card.

612
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,837
This is bad.

613
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,573
Stop it!

614
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,676
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

615
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:13,178
Stop it! Stop it!

616
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,417
What is that?

617
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,519
It's a device to make it bigger.

618
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,321
-Your dick?
-Really?

619
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,023
I got it from a magazine that I write for.

620
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:29,127
Apparently it draws out
the portion that's stuck deep inside.

621
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,562
Wow.

622
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,732
-There's a portion stuck inside?
-It feels good, right?

623
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,067
Yes. There's friction.

624
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,804
Then we can't stop you.

625
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,809
-Okay, let's continue.
-Right.

626
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,479
-Kinoshita, do you have a card?
-Not yet.

627
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,949
-I don't have a card yet either.
-Really?

628
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,185
-You too?
-Surprisingly enough.

629
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,188
That's not good.
I'm in trouble. Big trouble.

630
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,267
Whenever I go on TV,

631
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:11,603
I always shave the side of my head
beforehand...

632
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:16,074
-You shave, right?
-I do. But I didn't have time today.

633
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,310
So I came as I was.

634
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,080
But when I have hair here,
my symptoms get worse.

635
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,849
I like to feel lighter.

636
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:27,185
If you don't mind,
could you shave my hair on the sides?

637
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,155
-No problem.
-You can do that? That's great.

638
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:31,990
Thank you.

639
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,693
-I shave myself once a week.
-Really? Great.

640
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,929
-Thank you.
-He shaves his own head.

641
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,030
I see.

642
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,799
My wife's at her parents'
so she couldn't do it.

643
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,668
Are you saying that you have a wife?

644
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,637
-I have a wife. And two kids.
-She must be crazy.

645
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,645
What was that?

646
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,481
He laughed in the middle of
a normal conversation.

647
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,352
-What a waste.
-You laughed. Completely.

648
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:05,257
-You lost concentration.
-Damn!

649
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:07,593
"She must be crazy."
That's nothing special.

650
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:12,130
I was so relieved when he took the blades,
I relaxed like I do in my waiting room.

651
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,733
He said, "She must be crazy"
and I went "ha ha!"

652
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,569
You explained that well.

653
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,073
I worked so hard. But I fell for this?

654
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,009
-That might be enough for an orange card.
-What?

655
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:25,577
Please don't do that!

656
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:26,845
Let's take a look.

657
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,380
That was...

658
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,850
My wife's at her parents'
so she couldn't do it.

659
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,719
Are you saying that you have a wife?

660
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,688
-I have a wife. And two kids.
-She must be crazy.

661
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,427
Okay. Please be yellow!

662
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:44,630
That couldn't have been helped!

663
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,398
I realized right away.

664
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,400
Orange!

665
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,303
-You went that far.
-I totally laughed.

666
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,473
Nobody even tried to make you laugh.

667
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,042
That was fapping.

668
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,311
You're right. Damn.
I shall be more focused.

669
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,313
You fapped and blew your load.

670
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,615
That's his ecstasy.

671
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,521
Because you did it to yourself.

672
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,589
Here we go.

673
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:13,425
-So I deserved an orange card straight up?
-I think that's the reason.

674
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,361
-You did laugh.
-As an unbiased opinion?

675
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:17,829
So, where should I cut?

676
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,632
I have an undercut.
I want it cut up to the edge.

677
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,535
-I want you to shave all the way around.
-I see.

678
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,772
Sorry about this.

679
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,107
I want to feel lighter.

680
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,611
I don't feel myself otherwise.
I always do this.

681
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,946
-Want to start at the back?
-Yes. Thank you.

682
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,717
-It's pretty long.
-It is, right?

683
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,254
He's cutting a lot.

684
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,756
Does he want it that short?

685
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:47,125
-Like this, right?
-That short?

686
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,628
-Is the attachment on?
-It's really short.

687
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,365
-Is the attachment on?
-Attachment? Well...

688
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,933
It's what you gave me.

689
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,203
You took it off! You're shaving directly!

690
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,205
That's a monk thing! A monk thing!

691
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,873
As far as length is concerned!

692
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:03,141
The attachment...

693
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,310
I should've been clearer.
It's my bad, too.

694
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,751
The attachment...

695
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,387
-He needs to make it even.
-I have to, right?

696
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,588
Seriously?

697
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,057
-He's shaved quite a lot.
-Or it would be weird.

698
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,693
That's short even for a monk.

699
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,463
-Well, it does feel better.
-There is no other choice.

700
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,433
That feels better.

701
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,169
-Nice. That's a cleaner look.
-It feels good!

702
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,472
It feels good just watching this.

703
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,948
How does that feel?

704
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:46,518
What do you think?

705
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,587
It looks great.

706
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:54,292
If you don't like it, you can cut more.
What do you think?

707
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,294
It's a bit long all over.

708
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,030
-It looks a little heavy on top.
-Heavy?

709
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:01,099
Could you make it a bit lighter?

710
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,070
-Are you sure this okay?
-Yes.

711
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,305
-No continuity issues?
-What do you mean?

712
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,342
-You're not shooting a drama series?
-Nothing like that.

713
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,111
Isn't that a little rough?

714
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,615
That's a little...

715
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,749
That's scary.

716
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:21,853
It's a little long.

717
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,489
-That should look cleaner.
-Thank you.

718
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:29,060
-He cuts with confidence.
-Should you be cutting that much?

719
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,162
It looks nice.

720
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,466
-Isn't this...
-It's good.

721
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,435
-It's not too much?
-This matches the sides better.

722
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:38,436
It's not too much?

723
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,071
Not at all.

724
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,275
-It's not too much?
-He's doing a great job.

725
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,242
Really?

726
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,180
You're cutting that much?
Maybe we should...

727
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,217
That's a mess.

728
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:53,285
It's a mess?

729
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,854
You cut that much, but it's still a mess?
Really?

730
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,689
-Let me cut here.
-Where?

731
00:40:58,523 --> 00:40:59,958
No, wait...

732
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,226
That's nice.

733
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,695
How about that?

734
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,470
-That looks much better.
-Are you done?

735
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,473
-That feels good.
-It's nice.

736
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:18,577
-Why does it feel this good?
-It looks good.

737
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,313
Wow.

738
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,783
-How does it feel?
-I feel a whole lot lighter, actually.

739
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,120
My hair...

740
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,326
What is this? My hair keeps falling out.

741
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,828
It's because he gave you a part
down the middle.

742
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,364
-It's the hair he cut.
-It's parted in the middle.

743
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,767
-I don't...
-It's nice. You look like Eisaku Yoshida.

744
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,637
-Right?
-"Mr. Part-Down-The-Middle."

745
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,540
-That brings back memories.
-That really suits you.

746
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,876
-Want to play a card game?
-A card game?

747
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,677
-Why not?
-Sounds like fun.

748
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,880
-Just a little game.
-That's a good idea.

749
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,148
Kasuga.

750
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:58,683
Are you ready?

751
00:41:58,884 --> 00:41:59,718
Coming.

752
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:01,920
Did you buy those panties?

753
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,388
Yes, I bought them.

754
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,857
Are we doing something?

755
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,798
-We're going to play a card game.
-Okay. Let's play.

756
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,100
A card game?

757
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,603
-Shall we?
-Yes.

758
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,638
Sorry about that.

759
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,976
There are two sets of ten cards.
Iwahashi and I get ten each.

760
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,078
You flip the card and say "Blow."

761
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,048
-"Blow."
-"Blow"? Okay.

762
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:31,216
Or "Blown."

763
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,018
"Blow." "Blown."

764
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,520
"Blow." "Blown."
We try to make the most sets.

765
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,622
-Get it.
-What?

766
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,926
-It's probably easier to just do it once.
-"Blow" or "Blown"?

767
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,561
-I don't understand the "Blow" bit.
-As you flip it.

768
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,630
-I say "Blow"?
-"Blow."

769
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:46,965
-As I flip?
-Yeah.

770
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,334
-Should I try? Just one card?
-Yes.

771
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:50,602
"Blow."

772
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,408
Correct. He's blowing, right?

773
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:58,843
-I go again?
-Yes.

774
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,579
It's your turn.
See how many sets you can make.

775
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,747
"Blow."

776
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:06,418
You're doing great.

777
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,487
There's "Blown" too.
You can choose either one.

778
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,389
Okay. I get it now. Okay.

779
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:13,925
"Blow."

780
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,262
-It's "Blown."
-He's being blown.

781
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:18,797
I see.

782
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:23,368
Okay. Let's go on to the next game. Sorry.

783
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:26,671
This is the next game.
"Can do it" or "Can't do it."

784
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,774
-"Can do it" or "Can't do it"?
-"Can do it" or "Can't do it."

785
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,176
You go first, Iwahashi.

786
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:33,611
"Can't do it."

787
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:34,980
It's "Can do it."

788
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,882
You can do her, right?

789
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,117
Can I?

790
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,320
You think I can?

791
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:45,724
I might be able to.

792
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:47,659
If you try hard?

793
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,495
-Who is she?
-If you try really hard?

794
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,800
-So?
-I think I really can do her.

795
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,909
Why laugh at your own bit?

796
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,611
All on your own.

797
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,147
Damn.

798
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:13,885
What were you doing?

799
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:16,221
-He laughed at his Shochiku game.
-Seriously.

800
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,757
-It was his own idea.
-Can Iwahashi really do her?

801
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:19,924
He said that he can.

802
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,860
You squealed.

803
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,728
He can do her.

804
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,231
You said that he could.

805
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,565
But I really can do her.

806
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,202
-I think I could do her, too.
  -Who is this?

807
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:32,704
Chomi, from Chomi-Choko.

808
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,339
Oh, Chomi-Choko. Okay.

809
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,107
Let's take a look.

810
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,777
-This is a first for you, Kinoshita.
-Yes.

811
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,546
If you try really hard?

812
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,918
-So?
-I think I really can do her.

813
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:56,061
But, you have been contributing.

814
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,796
You have been working hard.

815
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,230
Yellow.

816
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,867
Thank you.

817
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:05,370
Everyone is pretty much
at the same level now.

818
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:12,077
Can I ask something before we restart?

819
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,878
Kasuga, what is that?

820
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,881
What is that?

821
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,318
You simply look like a guy at the gym.

822
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,886
What is that?

823
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,823
Well, it's America and Cuba.

824
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,726
-Why America and Cuba?
-I can't let this laughing become a habit.

825
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,068
Do we have to figure out the meaning
ourselves?

826
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:41,005
-Is that the point?
-Yes. That's the joke.

827
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:43,942
-You're not dressed as an actual person?
-Correct.

828
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:46,111
It's not a certain type of person, either?

829
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,312
Correct again.

830
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,981
Which side am I on? That's the question.

831
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,718
-Am I on the US side?
-All you have is that dick.

832
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:55,954
I wouldn't say that.

833
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:57,755
Your dick was amazing.

834
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,725
When it comes to your dick,
I'd even say that I respect it.

835
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,061
-Well, my dick is...
-It was amazing.

836
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:06,197
My dick thing went well,
but that's not all I do.

837
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,033
I can do that,

838
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,271
-but I want to try other things, too.
-Let's continue the game.

839
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,946
Do you want to play a game to see
who can keep themselves from burping?

840
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,047
Let's do that.

841
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,316
-You want to?
-Yeah. I'm good at that.

842
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:26,684
You use this powder.

843
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:28,620
You drink this.

844
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,222
-You drink this with water.
-With water?

845
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,358
-If you burp, you lose.
-There's no water.

846
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,426
One packet each. We drink the whole lot.

847
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,761
For the loser,

848
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:41,633
I have these pills that leave you unable
to taste anything that's bitter or spicy.

849
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,268
I don't like the sound of this.

850
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:44,936
I haven't tried them yet.

851
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,805
Do you want to see whether
they actually work or not?

852
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:49,440
How does that experiment sound?

853
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,544
The loser gets the pills, right?
How do we decide the loser?

854
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,045
The person who burps first.

855
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,446
Is this powder okay?

856
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:57,148
This is scary.

857
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:00,118
If you have two of these pills,

858
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,787
you lose your ability to taste.

859
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,088
Really?

860
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,125
-I haven't tried it yet.
-It's called "Strange Supplement."

861
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,662
-This is scary.
-We're fine if we don't burp first, right?

862
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,831
Right. The first person to burp
becomes the guinea pig.

863
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:16,935
-So, it starts the moment we drink it?
-That's right.

864
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,704
-We have to count down.
-Yes. Everyone goes together.

865
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,005
Sorry.

866
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,576
-This is scary.
-You sure brought some scary things.

867
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:25,677
Yeah, why not?

868
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:26,878
Three, two, one.

869
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,238
Maybe it takes a while.

870
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,009
-You lose.
-Yeah.

871
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,378
You must be joking.

872
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,947
-I don't feel anything yet.
-Me neither.

873
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,149
Why not?

874
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,352
-I don't feel a thing.
-Nothing at all.

875
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,122
-It doesn't work on you?
-Not at all.

876
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,157
What's with that?

877
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,526
That's what we want to ask you.

878
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:17,328
Sorry.

879
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:20,365
-Each pill has a different effect?
-You chew them.

880
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,301
Yes. It says to take two at a time.

881
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,637
-Why don't you try it?
-Go for it.

882
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,242
What happens once you swallow?

883
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,112
You chew it. Rub it on your tongue.
And then...

884
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,913
You lose your sense of taste.

885
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:37,982
-Scary.
-Which will you try first?

886
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:39,851
Why did you bring this stuff?

887
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,353
I wanted to do something all together.

888
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:44,522
Condensed milk?

889
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,427
Can you put some in my mouth?
I'm too scared.

890
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,264
There it is.

891
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,100
-I don't feel a thing.
-I do.

892
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,604
-Ready?
-It comes once you speak.

893
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:00,905
Here goes!

894
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:02,407
Gross.

895
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,943
-That is going to taste really sweet.
-It sure will.

896
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,751
It's not that sweet, actually.

897
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,386
This is amazing.

898
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,623
-It should be really sweet, right?
-It should be.

899
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,391
WASABI

900
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,094
-Okay.
-Can I put in as much as he did?

901
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,830
Well, I was fine just now.

902
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,600
-That will be so spicy.
-That will burn.

903
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,722
Those pills don't work at all.

904
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,093
Kasuga, why don't you try it?

905
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:57,061
Okay. I take two?

906
00:49:57,395 --> 00:50:00,098
It says you have to suck on them,
without biting them.

907
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,333
That's why. He chewed them.

908
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,136
I guess you have to let them
dissolve slowly.

909
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:14,912
-Suck them without biting.
-Okay. They go on top of your tongue.

910
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:18,049
This is going to take ages.

911
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,085
-It's going to take ages?
-They're not dissolving.

912
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:22,387
Damn that!

913
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,823
-How was it?
-The pills only work on sweetness.

914
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:30,194
-Maybe stimulation is a different sense.
-It's not part of taste.

915
00:50:31,763 --> 00:50:33,231
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

916
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,066
Open wide.

917
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:36,901
CONDENSED MILK

918
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:45,810
It works, right?

919
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,112
-I can sense a little sweetness.
-Right?

920
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,715
But it's not like condensed milk
usually is.

921
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:53,751
Normally it's so sweet,
your throat feels like it's on fire.

922
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:55,486
It's not that sweet.

923
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:57,688
-Yeah.
-I see.

924
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:01,125
Maybe wasabi was the problem.
Can I try a different one?

925
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,627
How about Tabasco sauce?

926
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,262
Try the Tabasco.

927
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:07,832
If this one works, it will be amazing.

928
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,167
This will be hot.

929
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,107
That's a lot.

930
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:25,016
Seriously?

931
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,590
It's not...

932
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,426
It's not what?

933
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,697
It's not that hot.

934
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:44,202
Not considering the amount.

935
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:50,708
It's not that hot.

936
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,344
Wow.
  I definitely would've laughed at that.

937
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,047
That's a hot sauce.

938
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,549
-It sure is.
-It's really spicy.

939
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,452
-What about mustard?
-Yeah, mustard.

940
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,155
Are you okay? It wasn't too hot, right?

941
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,257
-This is amazing.
-It truly is amazing.

942
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:09,160
-If it wasn't hot, this will be fine.
-This is amazing.

943
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:10,595
Can you eat spicy foods?

944
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,597
I don't really like spicy food.

945
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:15,633
-I'm not very tolerant.
-The pills must be working.

946
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,301
-Try the mustard.
-Are you ready?

947
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:20,238
-Maybe wasabi just doesn't mix well.
-Maybe you're right.

948
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,175
That's a lot.

949
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,334
Huh?

950
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,669
No way.

951
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,775
That is funny.

952
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,379
-The way you look is too much.
-That look is really funny.

953
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:04,615
What was that?

954
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,083
What happened?

955
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:08,452
What happened?

956
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:10,154
Well...

957
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:13,691
It was just funny watching him
pretend he was okay.

958
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,059
He kept pretending.

959
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:19,564
-He's such an idiot.
-I thought he was really funny, too.

960
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,934
-He swallowed so much.
-I was amazed that you all held it back.

961
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,368
He is an idiot.

962
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,073
That's a lot.

963
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,263
What the hell?

964
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:54,966
Why did you laugh?

965
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,001
It was impossible not to.

966
00:53:57,802 --> 00:54:00,137
In the end, he couldn't pretend anymore.

967
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:02,673
Because it was hot. It was extremely hot.

968
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,909
-When did it get hot?
-The very beginning!

969
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:08,579
-It was unbelievably spicy. And sweet.
-It was a complete hoax?

970
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,115
Yes. It was sweet and spicy.

971
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,352
What are those pills?
They don't do anything!

972
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:15,953
Iwahashi!

973
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,321
Red card!

974
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,390
I'm finished!

975
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,897
Gentlemen, we are two-thirds through.

976
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,933
We have less than two hours left.

977
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,505
What Kasuga did back there was...
It was a little surprising.

978
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:37,642
But, how can I put it?
It wasn't like it was out of character.

979
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,845
-But it was a unique way to get a laugh.
-Okay! Thank you!

980
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:44,515
I am so disappointed.

981
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,252
There's one thing I'm sure about now.

982
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:52,490
This is not a game where you can wait
  for an opportunity to do your thing.

983
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:53,457
I mean,

984
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:55,426
if you play really aggressively...

985
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:58,963
If you try hard to make them laugh,
there is a risk you'll laugh too,

986
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,898
but if I'd been more aggressive...

987
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,701
That may have worked better.

988
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,706
But, well...

989
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:10,107
I am so disappointed!

990
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:11,442
That was a million yen!

991
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:14,078
What was I thinking?

992
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,056
Wait!

993
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,763
Zombie Time!

994
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,864
Here they come.

995
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,634
What's going to happen?
And how long will it be?

996
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:37,968
Who is it?

997
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,104
Welcome to "Now and Then."
