1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,720
The Quest.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,760
The first one today is...

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
What is it?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,880
Wazuma Tetsuro, part two.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,480
- One day, we summoned Degawa.
- Degawa?

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,680
What is it this time?

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,840
It's Wazuma Tetsuro, part two.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,120
Oh, there it is.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,280
Wazuma Tetsuro.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,240
Wazuma, yeah!

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,040
It's a project where Japan's most
awkward middle-aged man,

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,400
Magician Degawa, takes an attempt
at Wazuma, an old Japanese magic.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,520
- That was amazing.
- However,

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,960
with a magic where he was to hang
the Tokkuri with a string...

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,840
Oh, no!

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,160
It's a dream!

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,320
I wasn't able to give it my all
with Wazuma,

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
so I actually appreciate the fact
I get another chance.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,640
And what I really want to say
to everyone at the studio is,

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,000
do not talk to me
during my performance.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Do not talk to me.
Don't just casually talk to me.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Will he be able to deliver
Wazuma magic successfully?

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,720
"The Quest"

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,800
Yeah!

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
The Quest has started. Tonight,

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,200
it's Wazuma Tetsuro, part two,

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,480
and the 13th Miyagawa expedition.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,520
Thanks!

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,600
It's a new four-kanji word,
Wazuma Tetsuro.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,960
I was hoping for another chance,

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
- so it worked out well.
- It worked out well?

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,880
So you've improved a lot this time?

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,240
Of course.

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,400
Maria, this is your second attempt.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,440
Yes, this is my second time
with Wazuma,

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,120
and I went to Milan once
for the Magician segment.

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,040
This was my third time,
and I'm finally getting the hang

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,360
of exposing how the tricks are done.

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,760
She demanded "Magician Maria."

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,800
And she flirted with the Master,

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
and he fell for it and became
her fan.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,600
- He was like "Sure, sure."
- There's the Master.

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,640
You see how he has that grin?

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,640
- Master...
- So it's true?

45
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,800
Yes, it's true.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,800
Master, get it together.

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,440
Nothing has started yet,

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
but he's already upset.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's get going.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,440
The Quest.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah!

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
Three plus two is five.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
I give up.

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
What?

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
There.

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,240
"A second attempt
at traditional Japanese magic"

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,640
In Shiretoko!

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
I can't do this any longer.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,920
This is no good.

60
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,000
"A."

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,880
Idiot!

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
Thirty minutes on Oedo Line
and on foot from Shiodome,

63
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,480
will he be successful this time?

64
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
Wazuma Tetsuro, part two.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
In Motoakasaka.

66
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,240
- We are here at Meiji Kinenkan.
- Meiji Kinenkan.

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,480
They will practise at Meiji
Kinenkan in Motoakasaka,

68
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,720
a historic wedding hall

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
that's been designated as
Tangible Cultural Property by Tokyo.

70
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,920
Maria, you're the sexy one
in Degawa Girls.

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,040
So you wear this sexy outfit
for Wazuma.

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, but I'm actually worried
since it's so windy right now.

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,080
No, you want it to be
more windy, right?

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm not.

75
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,120
- It's starting to get windy.
- Are you sure?

76
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,240
They will be taught by...

77
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,360
Ryusei Kamiguchi. He is one of
the few successors of Wazuma,

78
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,840
and he is also
a professional magician as well.

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
In the Edo period,

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
gambling was popular too.

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
Take this dice for example...

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Could you take a look?

83
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes.

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,880
It's ordinary dice.

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
- It's real.
- It is real.

86
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,120
What is this?

87
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,320
- It's two.
- It is two.

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,320
- It's two.
- Yes.

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
On the opposite side of two
is three.

90
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
On the opposite side of two
is three.

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,280
Three plus two is...

92
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,520
- Five.
- Yes, it's five.

93
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
It's starting.

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
Amazing.

95
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,760
- It's two.
- How is that possible?

96
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
It's three.

97
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
It's two.

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,000
What's three plus two?

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
- It's five.
- It's five.

100
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,480
Master,

101
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
you are incredible.

102
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you very much.

103
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,800
Let's start the training.

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
They will start with Zeni Wazuma.

105
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,640
There are four old coins.

106
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,040
Let's use these.

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
In each hand,

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
I'll hold a coin.

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Maria, could you take these
two coins

110
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,160
and place them on each hand?

111
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,800
- I'll put it on here.
- Put it on.

112
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,080
I have a coin in each of my hands,

113
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,880
and a coin on each of my hands.

114
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
I'll catch them

115
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
in the air.

116
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,720
- I'm sorry.
- One more time.

117
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,720
One more time.

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,320
This cuteness
is part of Master's charm.

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,840
I have a coin in each of my hands,
and I have a coin on both hands.

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
I'll catch it in air.

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,760
Okay.

122
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Two coins each are now...

123
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,640
- one coin
- What?

124
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,200
and in this hand, I have one, two,

125
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
- three coins.
- How come?

126
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
How is that done?

127
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
One more...

128
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,880
I'll hold a coin in each hand.

129
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
Maria, could you take...

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,960
He's holding them for sure, right?
He must have them.

131
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
- Here I go.
- Okay.

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,480
- If he messes up again...
- Then I'll catch these

133
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
in the air.

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
- See?
- I'm sorry. One more time.

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,640
- Is this part of the trick?
- That's incredible.

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
I got it!

137
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
Let me do it again.

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,440
- I got it already!
- Then do it.

139
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Now, Tani will give it a try.

140
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
You see how I have one each?

141
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,640
- That's amazing.
- I'll hold them.

142
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
Degawa, could you place a coin each

143
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
on my nails?

144
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,520
Yes, I'll place it here.

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
- One each...
- Now, I'll flip these.

146
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
- Okay.
- Ready?

147
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,080
It's the same.

148
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm sorry. Could you do it again?

149
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,720
It's exactly the same.

150
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Now, I'll place one here,

151
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,560
and another one here.

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,680
I'll hold them again.

153
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,240
Okay.

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll add some power to it.

155
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
Ha!

156
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,600
This side has...?

157
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
One.

158
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
Okay.

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
- This side has?
- Three.

160
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,640
Oh, I give up.

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
Now, let's see how it's done.

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
Just as you guessed,

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,200
- I'm making a mistake on purpose.
- Right.

164
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,640
- I got that part.
- Yes.

165
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,920
He's making it look like he dropped
the coin on his nail,

166
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,240
but he's actually dropping two coins
in one of his hands.

167
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,280
That's it.

168
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,120
So if it's placed on his nails again
and he holds them...

169
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
it looks as though a coin
had transferred to another hand.

170
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,560
- I see.
- Three.

171
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,920
Now, Degawa will try.

172
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,280
This is Kan'ei Tsuho,
a coin from the Edo period.

173
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,120
- I'll hold one in each hand.
- I'll hold them.

174
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,560
Maria, could you place a coin
on each hand?

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
Here, I put them on.

176
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,920
- Now, it's been placed on my hands.
- Yes.

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,960
Now the fun begins.

178
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Ready...

179
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
You opened your hand.

180
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,280
I dropped them.

181
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
One more time.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,280
Ready...

183
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,640
I think you enjoyed enough
of this Wazuma trick,

184
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,320
so he won't perform it
at the studio.

185
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
- I failed.
- I would love to see it.

186
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Next is a Wazuma trick using
a paper and a candle.

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,440
I have a blank piece of paper here.
I'll fold it in half like so.

188
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
I'll fold it in half again.

189
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,000
Then I'll wring the centre like so.

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
Then I'll light the centre part
with a candle.

191
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,240
It is burned now.

192
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
I don't like this...

193
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,480
- He doesn't like it.
- Of course, the fire is hot.

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,240
Now this hot fire, and the remains
of this paper will be moistened.

195
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
There!

196
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,200
Now, let's expose how it's done.

197
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,680
The burned paper is hidden

198
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
- Where is it?
- in his mouth.

199
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
No way.

200
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,440
A tiny piece of paper is hidden
in his left hand beforehand,

201
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,800
it's carefully placed in position
during the folding process.

202
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Then this part is burned,

203
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,240
and it's hidden in the mouth
without being noticed.

204
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Now, Degawa will try.

205
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,480
Over here is an ordinary Japanese
paper.

206
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Now, I'll fold this Japanese paper
in half.

207
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Then I'll turn it several times.

208
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Now, I'll turn and turn...

209
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Like a rocket,

210
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,240
- the tip is done like so.
- A tip?

211
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,280
Is your vocabulary limited?

212
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,760
Now, I'll light this on fire.

213
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,440
It's burned now.

214
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
Now, I'll blow it out.

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
There.

216
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
It's a bit hot.

217
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,240
There.

218
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,960
It's now out.

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,680
Now...

220
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,200
Now I'll moisten this.

221
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,160
He remembers it now.

222
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,200
He ate it?

223
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
He ate it.

224
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,280
Next is clairvoyance,
using a wooden box.

225
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,840
This box is made of a thick wood.
It's quite sturdy.

226
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,520
Could one of you place an item

227
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,920
in this wooden box
without it being seen by me,

228
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,120
close the lid, and hold on to it?

229
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,920
I'll be looking away from you.

230
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,160
Two of them picked out

231
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,360
a dipping sauce
for Tempura in bento.

232
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,920
- That's a hard one.
- That's difficult.

233
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,480
- I'll give it to you.
- Thank you.

234
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,680
There's nothing suspicious
about this box, right?

235
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,160
- No.
- Please go back to your seat.

236
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
My clairvoyance.

237
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,960
I'll use my clairvoyance
to guess what this is.

238
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,480
If he guesses this right,
I think he's a real genius.

239
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,680
Now...

240
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,240
Then I'll insert my powers...

241
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,640
What?

242
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
Maybe this was too hard?

243
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,600
- What?
- Is this too hard?

244
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
I feel as though...

245
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,080
it's some sort of food.

246
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,560
This can't be.

247
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,960
- He's right.
- If he guesses this,

248
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,720
then I'll cast myself at his feet
for real.

249
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Its colour is blackish.

250
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
- Amazing.
- It's blackish,

251
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,680
but it also has a reddish colour
to it. What could it be?

252
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,960
- No way.
- It's black and red.

253
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,480
- You're scaring me.
- Why?

254
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Heaven and Earth!

255
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Dipping sauce for Tempura?

256
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,640
I'm scared.

257
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Incredible!

258
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,120
- Now, time to expose how it's done.
- How is that possible?

259
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,720
The key to this Wazuma is that this
wooden box is a cube.

260
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,240
When the box is hidden in the back,
the lid is taken off.

261
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,080
And tactfully, the box is brought
to the front of the body.

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
Then just check the content
while taking it to the table.

263
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,040
Now, Degawa
will make an attempt at it.

264
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,440
Now Maria, place whatever you like
into this box.

265
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,440
Yes.

266
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,240
She picked scissors.

267
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
I put it in.

268
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,920
- Please hand that box over to me.
- He's pushing it.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Could you hold it?

270
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,760
You know,
it's hard for me to hold it.

271
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,480
Okay, go ahead.

272
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
He's barely holding it.

273
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,120
- Now, I have the box.
- Yes.

274
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,280
Now, I'll use my clairvoyance

275
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,000
to see what's in this box.

276
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,360
Is something wrong?

277
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,120
He's growling.

278
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,120
When are you going to take a look?

279
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,960
When is he going to take a look?

280
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,640
"Tetsuro doesn't know when to look"

281
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,840
When are you going to take a look?

282
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,400
- When is he going to look?
- He's growling.

283
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,080
- He's growling.
- Now...

284
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,400
If I put it there,
it would look suspicious,

285
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,720
so I'll place it on the black cloth
over here.

286
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,800
- He hasn't taken a look yet.
- He hasn't?

287
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,920
When is he going to look?

288
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,840
- Not yet.
- When are you going to look?

289
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,200
- He looked at it!
- He looked.

290
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,840
"Tetsuro couldn't see too well"

291
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
Please stop.

292
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,960
He couldn't see?

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,240
He's looking.

294
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,640
In addition, he'll learn
Western magic this time.

295
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,520
An Illusionist, Magician Daiki
will be instructing them.

296
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,360
He was the one who helped out

297
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
with Magician Degawa
when we returned to Japan,

298
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
with all the behind-the-scenes
stuff.

299
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Magician Daiki will teach us

300
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,880
a trick that could be done
at school tomorrow.

301
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,640
- That's great.
- Here's a rubber.

302
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
I'll use this rubber here

303
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,840
to do an unusual magic trick.

304
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
First,

305
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
I'll take this cover,

306
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,560
and crumple it.

307
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll make it disappear.

308
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,080
- Already at this point...
- What?

309
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
In addition...

310
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,400
now I'm going to say a magic word.
One, two, three.

311
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,440
- It's back to its original form.
- What?

312
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,840
- What? I didn't get it.
- I didn't get it.

313
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
Now, let's see how it's done.

314
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,600
This rubber has two covers.

315
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,880
And when it's rotated,
half of it is uncovered.

316
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,400
- That's what it is.
- This is the trick.

317
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,960
The removed cover is dropped
into the desk pocket.

318
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
The rubber is rotated
while in the hand,

319
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,440
to make it look like it's back
to its original form.

320
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,400
And lastly, you show the front
and back of this rubber.

321
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
But if you do it like so...

322
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
then it would look like

323
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
- the front and the back were seen.
- I see.

324
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,400
I don't know if Tetsuro can do this.

325
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,840
Now, it's Degawa's turn.

326
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,480
- This is difficult.
- Now, over here is a regular

327
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,480
ordinary rubber.

328
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Now, I'll take it out like so.

329
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
There's no tricks here.

330
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,520
Now, I'll use this rubber

331
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,760
to have some fun.

332
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
First...

333
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,040
- we'll take this lid...
- Lid?

334
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,720
There!

335
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,920
- Yes.
- It disappeared.

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
That's not it, though.

337
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll say a magic word

338
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,440
- to this rubber here too.
- Magic word?

339
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,760
Three, two, one.

340
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
There!

341
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,160
It's back to its original state.

342
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,320
I saw the white part.

343
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,640
I think the rotation part
is not necessary.

344
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,400
And a very special magic.

345
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
Every one of them.

346
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,640
He'll perform an illusion.

347
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,280
This time, I'll perform
Wazuma Tetsuro

348
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,240
and Magician Degawa.

349
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,680
It's very difficult

350
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,800
- to perform both of them
- That's incredible.

351
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,240
at the same showing.

352
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
- That's amazing.
- Oh, is it difficult?

353
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,640
Of course it is.

354
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
"Oh, is it difficult?"

355
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,520
That is so annoying.

356
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,600
Specifically speaking,
what's difficult?

357
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,240
Specifically speaking,

358
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,560
it's Japanese cuisine
and Italian cuisine.

359
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
When you go to
a wonderful restaurant,

360
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,600
it means that they serve both

361
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
Japanese cuisine
and Italian cuisine.

362
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
Is there such a restaurant?

363
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,360
Oh, I'm starved.

364
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,080
First, I'll have ginger-fried pork.

365
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,640
Oh, it's delicious.

366
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Next is Carbonara?

367
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
What?

368
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,840
Well, maybe some places have
ginger-fried pork and carbonara.

369
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,560
It's a dish that's much more
complicated.

370
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,240
Now, let me show you.

371
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,920
- Next, Wazuma Tetsuro Show
- Incredible.

372
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,240
- is starting.
- Amazing.

373
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,720
- It's so funny.
- What did you think after that?

374
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,320
I asked, "Is there a restaurant
that serves everything?"

375
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
but when I think about it,
casual restaurants have them.

376
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,240
That's right.

377
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
Please share your enthusiasm here.

378
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,200
I put so much into this
that I'm willing to retire,

379
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,040
if I fail this today.

380
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,480
I'll put retirement on the line.

381
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
- Retire from what?
- Is that

382
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
retirement from Magician Degawa too?

383
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,320
Or it is just Wazuma Tetsuro?
Or is it everything?

384
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,040
- Wazuma Tetsuro.
- Wazuma Tetsuro?

385
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,120
We got it.

386
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Now, Wazuma Tetsuro's
retirement is on the line.

387
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,520
It's a crucial performance.

388
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,000
- Please get ready.
- Thank you very much.

389
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Thank you for waiting.

390
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,760
They are ready.

391
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,320
Here is Wazuma Tetsuro!

392
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,080
Yeah!

393
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,400
Wazuma Tetsuro.

394
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,880
Maria.

395
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
It's been awhile.

396
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,200
- It's been awhile.
- I'm Wazuma Tetsuro.

397
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,120
Thank you for coming.

398
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,840
First, I would like to use this
disposable chopstick for some fun.

399
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,120
We haven't seen this one.

400
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,240
There, there, there!

401
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,760
What? Where's the chopstick?

402
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,320
Is it the angle?

403
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
- Is it under his arm?
- There.

404
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,200
Is it the angle?

405
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
It was all obvious to me.

406
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,640
I had fun with a disposable
chopstick.

407
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
- I couldn't see anything at all.
- Stop lying.

408
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,400
Up next is...

409
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
magic using this paper.

410
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,400
Okay.

411
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,680
First,

412
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
I'll light the candle.

413
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
Okay.

414
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,760
He sucks at blowing out the fire.

415
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,960
- Now...
- Who would've thought?

416
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,240
I'll take this paper and...

417
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,200
fold it in half.

418
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,400
- Okay.
- And I take this folded paper

419
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,480
and twist it.

420
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,680
- Twist it?
- Then...

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,320
I twist it and make a tip.

422
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,680
- Do this
- There's a tip.

423
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,880
and this.

424
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Now, I'll light this.

425
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,400
It'll burn.

426
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,200
Exactly, it'll burn.

427
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,160
Okay.

428
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
I'll blow this fire out.

429
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,560
It's hot.

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,360
Now, I'll moisten this part
a little.

431
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,000
He's eating it.

432
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,080
- Now...
- He ate it.

433
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,320
- He said something.
- Take a look at this paper.

434
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
He's struggling to talk.

435
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,400
His saliva is being taken.

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,440
His saliva is being taken.

437
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,360
It's torn.

438
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
Your saliva!

439
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
It's weakened by your saliva.

440
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,000
It's torn.

441
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,640
It's hard to tell.

442
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
Isn't it too wrinkled?

443
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
- There!
- Oh, he scared me.

444
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The paper is back
to its original form.

445
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,800
Amazing!

446
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,000
- My stomach hurts from laughing.
- That was funny.

447
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,440
It's done.

448
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,680
He blew it out gently.

449
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,080
He blew the candle out gently.

450
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,720
- Next magic uses this rubber.
- There it is.

451
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,960
It's the first magic.

452
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,080
There's nothing tricky here.

453
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,760
First, I'll do this.

454
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,160
There.

455
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,240
This is an ordinary rubber.

456
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,680
There's nothing strange about it.

457
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,600
First, I'll make
this cover disappear.

458
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,640
It disappeared.

459
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,160
That's not all.

460
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,440
This rubber is then...

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
When I say the magic word...

462
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,840
Three, two, one.

463
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,120
There!

464
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,480
Amazing!

465
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,200
- His right shoulder!
- That was good.

466
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,320
- His right shoulder!
- Amazing.

467
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,360
That was great.

468
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,400
Thank you very much.

469
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,880
It's 100% so far.

470
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,160
It's amazing.

471
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,720
Next, here's an ordinary box.

472
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
There's nothing tricky about it.

473
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,480
Now, inside this box...

474
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,280
- Daisuke.
- Yes.

475
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
Pick whatever you want,

476
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,320
and place something in this box

477
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,400
while I have my back towards
this box.

478
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,560
I can't see anything.
I won't know what you put in there.

479
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,280
- I can put it in?
- Of course.

480
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,600
This was given to me earlier.

481
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,480
"A scorpion toy"

482
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
I think this is going to be hard.

483
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,120
Please put it in so I can't see it,
and place a lid on it.

484
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,120
Okay.

485
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Now...

486
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,160
Could you bring your hands
a little closer? Thank you.

487
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
- Do you have it?
- Now...

488
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,560
I don't know what's inside this box.

489
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,040
Please go back to your seat.

490
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
Excuse me. Thank you.

491
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,440
He's not looking.

492
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,480
I have no idea
what's inside this box.

493
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,720
I'll use my clairvoyance to guess
what is inside this box now.

494
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,840
No way.

495
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,600
- Hey!
- It's impossible.

496
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,560
Now, what is inside this box?

497
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,080
I'll use my clairvoyance...

498
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440
to guess what's in here.

499
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
- Good luck.
- You can't see it.

500
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,600
- It's impossible.
- Usually,

501
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,440
you won't know what's inside
this box.

502
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,280
- However, with clairvoyance...
- Isn't it sort of long?

503
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,880
I'll guess what's inside the box.

504
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,080
His shoulder blades...

505
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,280
Now...

506
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,800
- He has a horrifying look.
- Now...

507
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
- Isn't it too long?
- Now, there's something

508
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,040
- inside this box.
- Yes.

509
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,960
Okay.

510
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,400
I'll use my clairvoyance

511
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,320
and guess what's in here
from behind.

512
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
From behind?

513
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,080
I'll put it behind me
and show you what's inside.

514
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,040
Okay.

515
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,040
Now

516
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
what is in this box?

517
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,640
- It's very clairvoyant.
- There's so much eye contact.

518
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
I need to focus to succeed.

519
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,040
- His eyes.
- What's in here?

520
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm going to put this box down now.

521
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
What?

522
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,960
I'll put this box down now. What?

523
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
It's a bit...

524
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,480
I'll put it down again.

525
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
I'll put this box down now.

526
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,000
Please put it down already.

527
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,760
Hey! I told you
I'm going to put it down now.

528
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,640
- I'm going to put it down now.
- Please don't get upset.

529
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,600
Please don't get upset.

530
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,880
He looks like he doesn't like it.

531
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,800
What?

532
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,040
What is it?

533
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,240
What is it?

534
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,480
- Hey! I'm clairvoyant.
- He can see it.

535
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,400
He's clairvoyant.

536
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,040
Hey! Now, I'm going
to put it down here.

537
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,280
- I'll put the box down.
- Okay.

538
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm telling you
to put it down already!

539
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
Hey!

540
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
- He sucks at it.
- Hey!

541
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,440
Put it down already.

542
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,640
- He's checking it right now.
- Hey!

543
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,120
- I put it down now.
- He saw it?

544
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,360
- Yes.
- That's good.

545
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,480
Now, I'll focus my mind.

546
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
Li Shang heigh-ho water spinach!

547
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,880
- What does he mean?
- Hey!

548
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,960
There.

549
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,040
- This is...
- It's a water spinach.

550
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,720
This is very difficult.

551
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,600
This is very dangerous.

552
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,080
- Oh.
- This is...

553
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay!

554
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,000
I see it!

555
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,360
It's a scorpion!

556
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,920
Amazing.

557
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,560
- That was great.
- He was clairvoyant.

558
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
It's clairvoyance.

559
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,440
Now, please have
a pleasant chat for a while.

560
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,160
Next is Magician Degawa's
super illusion.

561
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,720
"Second part,
Magician Degawa's illusion"

562
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,760
It's the second part.

563
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,080
Now,

564
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,560
the next one will be
my last performance.

565
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,560
- Oh?
- Okay.

566
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,800
Over here is a tun--
a chimney like object.

567
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,240
It doesn't look like a chimney.

568
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,000
I'll open this and show it to you.

569
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
- There.
- I have no idea.

570
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,600
There.

571
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,200
There.

572
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,960
When I open it up,

573
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,240
it's hollow inside.

574
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,560
- Okay.
- It's like a rocket.

575
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,760
Now, Princess Maria will

576
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,560
- go inside here.
- She's Princess Maria?

577
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Is she going to be okay?

578
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,200
Will Princess Maria be okay?

579
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,600
- Now, I'll close this.
- Princess!

580
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,200
Now, Princess Maria is in here.

581
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,880
Now, I'll close each one...

582
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,200
of these.

583
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,640
Now, that's not all.

584
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
Ready, go!

585
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,280
A chimney with Princess Maria
is now sideways.

586
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
- That's dangerous, right?
- Yes.

587
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,120
That's not safe.

588
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
- Now...
- Oh no, don't turn it!

589
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,000
There's more.

590
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
Will she be okay?

591
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,160
Let's have some fun here.

592
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
Now,

593
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,440
bring me the thing.

594
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,160
No, what is it?

595
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,520
Let's take this dangerous
sword-like thing,

596
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,360
and insert it here.

597
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,360
Oh no!

598
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,440
- No!
- Stop it!

599
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,920
- There!
- Princess Maria!

600
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,160
Princess Maria!

601
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,280
- There!
- You're in danger!

602
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Now, here's the final one.

603
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,680
- There!
- Hey!

604
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,560
Now, Princess Maria's body

605
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,000
has been cut into several pieces.

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,840
There's more, though.

607
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,040
Ready?

608
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,240
There!

609
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,280
No!

610
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,440
Now, Princess Maria's body

611
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,480
has been divided into seven parts.

612
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
There.

613
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,080
Head, neck, chest,

614
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,000
chest, hips, legs, legs.

615
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Chest was a bit off, right?

616
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,480
- He said chest, chest.
- Now,

617
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,880
I'll put it back.

618
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,440
Ready, go!

619
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,840
Now, we'll take this chimney
again and...

620
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,400
put it back.

621
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,800
Now, I'll take it out one by one.

622
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,160
There.

623
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,120
There.

624
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,720
There.

625
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,080
- Now...
- Is it possible?

626
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,480
Maria's body
that's been shattered

627
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,800
I will put back into one piece
with my magic words.

628
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
Kushin, Shori, Todaiji!

629
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,080
Todaiji?

630
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,360
- The one in Nara?
- That's right.

631
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,400
Now, let's open it.

632
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,800
There.

633
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,040
There.

634
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
There.

635
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,120
I'll open it.

636
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Amazing!

637
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
There!

638
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Where were you?

639
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,400
Now...

640
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,160
It's showtime!

641
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,360
Wonderful.

642
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,840
It's wonderful.

643
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,800
Miyagawa, what did you think?

644
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,440
This last one was incredible.

645
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,360
But you know how he got upset
at us when we spoke to him?

646
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,680
When did I get upset?

647
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,200
When you were trying to place
the box behind you.

648
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,240
That was some clairvoyance.

649
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,200
I felt the malice of the staff.

650
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,480
You're right.

651
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,520
I couldn't tell whether it was
a scorpion or a crayfish.

652
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,040
That's what was stopping you?

653
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,920
I couldn't tell.

654
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,080
Asako, what did you think?

655
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,480
His magic words were so original.

656
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,120
- The first one was "Water spinach."
- It was water spinach.

657
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,960
- The second one was Todaiji.
- Todaiji.

658
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
"Todaiji"

659
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,440
Good job! That was Wazuma Tetsuro.

660
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,560
Princess Maria, thank you too.

661
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
Thank you.

662
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,600
Next up is this.

663
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,600
The 13th Miyagawa Expedition!

664
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,440
- Yes!
- Thank you very much.

665
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,920
Where will they go this time?

666
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,520
Shiretoko Peninsula in Hokkaido.

667
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,400
I see.

668
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
Provenance of life, that's been
continuing from the ancient times.

669
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
Shiretoko is registered
as World Natural Heritage Site.

670
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,240
I really want to go.

671
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,960
What do we do in Shiretoko?

672
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
The land, the sea,

673
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,040
and the river.
We'll go to all of them.

674
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,680
The land, the sea, and the river?

675
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,120
That's unheard of.

676
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,240
A terrifying hot spring
where your body is numbed.

677
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,960
I don't want to go to such a thing.

678
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,600
A divine fish

679
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,360
for the Ainu,

680
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
Chip Kamuy.

681
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,800
Chip Kamuy?

682
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,680
A large school of Pink Salmon
that fills up the river.

683
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,280
I see.

684
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,600
It's time for them
to go up the river.

685
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,720
- I wanted to see that once.
- Me too.

686
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,600
When they go up the river,

687
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,920
it's just before
the bears hibernate,

688
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
and they are at the river too.

689
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,120
They will be hunting away.

690
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,680
They will smack it
and eat just its belly.

691
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Then they throw away the remains
and take another smack at it.

692
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,360
When they find us, it'll rush
over and smack us. It'll be the end.

693
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
- They'll smack us dead.
- For sure.

694
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm off to Shiretoko!

695
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,080
I'll do my best.

696
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
What adventure awaits him?

697
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
A great adventure is about to start.

698
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,880
Miyagawa Expedition.

699
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,960
World Natural Heritage Site,
Shiretoko.

700
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,680
The 13th Miyagawa Expedition!

701
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,800
It's obviously incredible

702
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,400
in Shiretoko!

703
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,400
The expedition members
are Iwashita, Enjoji,

704
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,880
- and Kitami.
- Kitami?

705
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
It's been a while.

706
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,160
Member Kitami,
also known as Chap.

707
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
- Hello.
- Hi.

708
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,120
He is named after Chaplin
since his reactions are like him.

709
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,640
"October, 2017
The third Miyagawa Expedition"

710
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,200
You go there, then you go...
Oh, you managed to get there.

711
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,320
Watch out!

712
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,760
Are you okay?

713
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,120
How long has it been?

714
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,520
It's been about three years.

715
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,600
- It sure has been three years.
- He's gained weight.

716
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,880
- The size of your belly is no joke.
- Oh boy.

717
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Enjoji.

718
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,920
Your dark spots are gone.

719
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
- What? He got rid of his spots?
- Yes.

720
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,880
I used laser to get rid
of my dark spots before.

721
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,360
Now there are no signs of it left.

722
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,840
I have clear skin.

723
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,520
So is it done now?

724
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,800
Currently, I have a friend

725
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,760
who has a hair removal salon,

726
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,400
and I was asked to be a model
for the facial hair removal.

727
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,400
Sample model
for removing facial hair?

728
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,600
But...

729
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,000
now that you mentioned it,

730
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,680
I can sort of see that your facial
hair is a little lighter.

731
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,880
However...

732
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,440
Oh? Wait one second.

733
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,760
You may be losing your facial hair,

734
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
but you have eggs

735
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,680
around your mouth.

736
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,920
I'm serious.

737
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,240
If you're concerned about your dark
spots, then as a mature person,

738
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,440
you shouldn't have any egg remains
around your mouth!

739
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,560
You idiot.

740
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,480
- An egg?
- A boiled egg.

741
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,960
Their adventure is three days long.

742
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,360
Their goal is to deliver
the phenomenon

743
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,840
that occurs at Shiretoko's land,
sea, and river.

744
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Today, we'll head over to...

745
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,600
land!

746
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,200
The expedition will head

747
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,560
to Mount Io,
which is 1562 metres in elevation.

748
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,120
Their goal is to see...

749
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,040
Shocking!
A body numbing hot spring.

750
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,760
From Shiretoko Goko Lakes
to the foot of Mount Io is 11 km.

751
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,640
It's a two-hour walk.

752
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,280
What they have to pay attention
to the most during on the way is...

753
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
Leader!

754
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,280
You scared me. What is it?
That was scary.

755
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
Please take a look at this.

756
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
What?

757
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,280
Look at this mark here.

758
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,720
Isn't this from a bear?

759
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,200
You see how it's climbing up
the tree? See?

760
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,120
It's brown bear.

761
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,440
Here at Shiretoko,
brown bears are very common.

762
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,880
The only way to stay safe is to
avoid any chances of encounter.

763
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,600
I think this bear is about the size
of you, Chap.

764
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,320
- Like so?
- Exactly.

765
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,840
So it's pretty agile.

766
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,880
Right.

767
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,520
Wait, did you think to do it
just now?

768
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,080
That's not necessary.
You don't have to try so hard.

769
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,760
But seriously, do your best.

770
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,160
I really want you to be a director.

771
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,200
Leader.

772
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,080
- What is it?
- I'm a director already.

773
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,800
What? Is that true? My bad.
I thought you were still an AD.

774
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,400
I've been a director
for about a year now.

775
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,080
- You're a director?
- For a year?

776
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,200
They came to the foot of Mount Io.

777
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,320
Make sure to be careful.
We have no idea what it's like.

778
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,560
Yes.

779
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,720
- It does feel warm.
- The colours are...

780
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,360
They are going up Kamuiwakka River.

781
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,320
This is it.

782
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,400
This is it. It's something else.

783
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,960
- This is the rumoured hot spring.
- What? This is a hot spring?

784
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,080
Leader, I guess it's not good
to stay in it for too long.

785
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,080
What?

786
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,880
How is it possible
for a hot spring?

787
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,520
What is it effective for?

788
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,880
It's good for your heels.

789
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,280
What? For heels?

790
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,400
Why is it just that part?

791
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,040
Would you want to go if you knew
it was good for your heels?

792
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,400
You know?

793
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,640
Do you ever go
"Oh, my heels are tired"?

794
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,160
They are ready.

795
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,200
The temperature of the water
is about 35 or 36 degrees Celsius.

796
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,800
Let's go!

797
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,760
Yes.

798
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,600
He decided to go in the hot water.

799
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,320
Why am I the only one going in?

800
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
That's not right.

801
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,320
What? What is this?

802
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,600
Leader Miyagawa is experiencing
some discomfort.

803
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
What is this?

804
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,640
- What?
- What is this?

805
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,080
It's not tingling,
but it feels nasty.

806
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,320
What is it?

807
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,640
They all work up the courage
and go in the hot spring.

808
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
- It itches for some reason.
- It does itch, right?

809
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,120
- What does that mean?
- It itches?

810
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,840
- My legs itch.
- What is this hot spring?

811
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,640
This hot spring doesn't feel good.

812
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,320
It makes me feel restless.

813
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,720
This hot spring...

814
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,360
is made of strongly acidic
hot water.

815
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,000
This part itches. What is this?

816
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,920
- There's a unit called pH.
- Right, pH.

817
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,440
The lower the number is,
the more acidic the substance is.

818
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,880
So...

819
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
I can't take this anymore!

820
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
It's too long!

821
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,400
It stings like jelly fish.

822
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,800
Acidity here...

823
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
is more than lemon juice,

824
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,080
but less than stomach acid.

825
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,560
That's not good!

826
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,560
A little bit of lemon juice
in your eyes is very painful.

827
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,000
Here at Kamuiwakka hot spring falls,

828
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,720
volcanic gases dissolve into water,
making it highly acidic.

829
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,080
Rubbing a dirty 10 yen coin
in this hot spring will...

830
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,880
- make it super shiny.
- That was amazing.

831
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
This 10 yen was...

832
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,440
instantly cleaned. We shouldn't
be going into such water.

833
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,880
Think about it. Would you go in
when you squirt lemon juice in here?

834
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,240
Of course it would sting and itch.

835
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,480
Is that okay?

836
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,040
And all that happens,
but why is it just for heels?

837
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't get that part.

838
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
Mount Io has hot springs
that are highly acidic.

839
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,880
Since they are there, they decide
to head over to its crater.

840
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,160
It's very steep here.
It would be great

841
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,680
if I had a stick or something.

842
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,760
It would make it easier to walk.

843
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,440
- Do you have any stick-like thing?
- Could it be...?

844
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,720
Yes, we have some.

845
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
Thanks.

846
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,080
That's right. This is it.

847
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,600
You go like so on this.

848
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,120
- Then you go, one, two, one, two.
- He's incredible.

849
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,160
Idiot!

850
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm surprised I was able to do this.

851
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
I turned around while I was
on this and went "Idiot!"

852
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,680
I think that was genius.

853
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,840
This isn't it.

854
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
Give me a stick.

855
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,360
Give me a stick.

856
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,360
That's right. This is it.

857
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,400
With this, you go...

858
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,560
A.

859
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,800
I.

860
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,440
U. E.

861
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,120
- He can do it?
- O.

862
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,720
A.

863
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,520
Ho. Idiot!

864
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,960
You Idiot!

865
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,320
This is a hand flag.

866
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,360
This isn't it. A stick so that it
would help me climb this mountain.

867
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,480
Give me a stick.

868
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,960
That's right. This is it.

869
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,640
That is so detailed.

870
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Seriously...

871
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
I hope...

872
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,800
He's doing well.

873
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
I hope-- You Idiot!

874
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,720
Hey...

875
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,280
This was for granny.
You know, granny.

876
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,160
This is no time for this.

877
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
A stick for climbing.

878
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,440
A stick.

879
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,040
That's right. Exactly!

880
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,280
Exactly!

881
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,720
- Exactly!
- He got it.

882
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,200
This is it!

883
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,600
Mount Io.

884
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,840
Former sulphur mining area.

885
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh, is this it?

886
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,360
Oh, I smell sulphur here.

887
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,080
This is one of the leading sulphur
erupting mountains of the world.

888
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,240
That place was something else.

889
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,920
At the last eruption in 1936,

890
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
110,000 tonnes of sulphur
went down the mountains.

891
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,920
- They climb up rugged rocks.
- That's rugged.

892
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,000
They finally arrive at the crater.

893
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Wow, it's yellow.

894
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,960
Seriously?

895
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,600
What is this?

896
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,680
Wow, this is amazing.

897
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,720
This is a rare footage.
Please take a look at this.

898
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,640
This is very rare in the world
where you can get this close

899
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,560
- to a crater.
- I see.

900
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,040
Leader Miyagawa is impressed
with this grand view.

901
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,920
However, there was another man
who was immensely touched.

902
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,840
Leader.

903
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,160
You know how we
finally arrived here,

904
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,520
with such magnificent view?

905
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,880
As a Director,

906
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,960
would it be okay for me to add
a narration to this scene?

907
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,800
- What? Come again?
- A narration?

908
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
I was shocked because
it was so sudden.

909
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,000
I edited this scene in my head.

910
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,840
Verification. A narration by Kitami,

911
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,400
who once came on as a director,
but with so many shortcomings,

912
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,640
he was forced to start all over
again from the bottom.

913
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,640
Let's take a look.

914
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,440
Okay, then let's hear
your narration.

915
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,440
Then what should we do?

916
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,080
- If you would just look at it.
- Is that okay?

917
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,560
My view is that you would come up
strongly from here,

918
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,840
and you immediately find it
and the narration will go.

919
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,440
Okay. Could we do it then?

920
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,680
- Let's go.
- How will it be?

921
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,880
There.

922
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,760
Wow! Amazing!

923
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,360
- Amazing.
- Incredible.

924
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,160
What did Miyagawa Expedition see?

925
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,200
Pon! Oh, I'm sorry.

926
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,480
"Pon" won't do.

927
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,080
What do you mean,
"Pon, oh, I'm sorry"?

928
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,520
That was a narration before
you go "Wow."

929
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
Right.

930
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,800
That was off.

931
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,360
It was supposed to go,
"What did they see?

932
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,880
Wow, amazing!"
But it was the opposite.

933
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,120
If you want to clear your name,
we can do it again.

934
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,560
That was a failure just now.

935
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,760
You still have three days.

936
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,960
Exactly. Let's say it's good
for now.

937
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
How could you say it's good?

938
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
They completed their journey
on the land,

939
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,080
and finished their first day.

940
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,560
- He didn't do it.
- The second day.

941
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,360
Miyagawa Expedition
charges ahead on a foggy sea.

942
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,360
- It's the sea now.
- It's the sea.

943
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,920
They are aiming to catch the fish
the Ainu regard as divine.

944
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,400
It's Chip Kamuy.

945
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,480
It's a carnivorous fish that could
get as big as 150 cm.

946
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,600
However...

947
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,840
they didn't get any hits at all.

948
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,400
They went at it for five hours,

949
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,240
but they weren't able to catch
Chip Kamuy.

950
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,720
However, there was an offer to eat
Chip Kamuy caught in a net,

951
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,920
so they headed over
to a nearby restaurant.

952
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,120
- What? Is this it?
- This is it.

953
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
What? Let me see this.

954
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,600
This is Chip Kamuy.

955
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
What's with this face?

956
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,800
It's huge.

957
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,400
Presently, it's called
the Bering wolffish.

958
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,120
As you can see, it has sharp teeth
and it manages to crush

959
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,320
hard shells of crabs
and shrimps as well.

960
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,360
How does it taste?

961
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,640
They will have it simmered
in soy broth.

962
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
That looks delicious.

963
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,440
It's delicious.

964
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,960
It's super delicious.

965
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,080
Its skin is so soft,
it's like collagen.

966
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,480
I mean we wanted to catch it.

967
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,200
But at least

968
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,960
we were able to see it and eat it.

969
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
I think that was great.

970
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,600
Right?

971
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
Now, could you do your narration?

972
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,840
- At the end of our second day,
- So it's happening here?

973
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,440
please finish it off
with your narration.

974
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,040
No results were produced today.

975
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,680
Will Miyagawa Expedition

976
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,160
be able to fully enjoy

977
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,880
the nature of Shiretoko tomorrow?

978
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,920
We aren't here for fun.

979
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,400
Are we here to enjoy Shiretoko?

980
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,200
This is not a company trip

981
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,800
of middle aged men.

982
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,040
The third day.

983
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,320
"Oronko Rock, The third day"

984
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,160
Everyone! It's our last day here.

985
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,960
As a leader, I consider today

986
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,560
to be the most important day.

987
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,920
We will find the Pink Salmon that go
upstream

988
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,560
from this sea, up the river.

989
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,680
The last adventure involves a large
school of Pink Salmon in the river.

990
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,440
They head to Kanayama River
on the west side of the peninsula.

991
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,200
This is it.

992
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,960
When they walk along the river...

993
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,880
Leader.

994
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,800
A staff walking
with a professional guide

995
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,760
- found something.
- What did they find?

996
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,080
That's bear excrement for sure.

997
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,280
That's something else.

998
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,280
In addition...

999
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,120
Look.

1000
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,400
Maybe we can't air this part.

1001
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,200
See?

1002
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,040
They ate Pink Salmon

1003
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,600
right here.

1004
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,680
The remains of a Pink Salmon
that's still wet.

1005
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,720
When they realise that they're
unfit to be called an "expedition,"

1006
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,800
they all look like this.

1007
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,680
They go up the river while
watching out for bears.

1008
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,400
Hey, look!

1009
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,720
Over there!

1010
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,480
By the rock! Go for it!

1011
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,640
There it is. It's huge.

1012
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,680
The number of Pink Salmon
are increasing.

1013
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
That's great.

1014
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,240
Shall we go upstream some more?

1015
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,280
Yes.

1016
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,960
They arrive at a place they suspect
to be a spawning spot.

1017
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,960
Everyone, please take a look
at this.

1018
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,160
This area.

1019
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,440
There's a lot here.

1020
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,040
Look.

1021
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,400
There's a lot here.

1022
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,480
Leader goes underwater
to get the video.

1023
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,320
Wait. This part is almost too scary.

1024
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Wait.

1025
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,760
Wait!

1026
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,320
It's super scary.

1027
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,920
There are so many here.

1028
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,880
There's a lot here.

1029
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,920
Right, inside the river...

1030
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,920
a life drama was going on.

1031
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,720
- Amazing.
- It's like watching a water tank.

1032
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,480
Even when their body is damaged
by rough waters and predation,

1033
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,960
they go up the river
to find a new life.

1034
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,520
That's amazing.

1035
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,480
However, during their journey,

1036
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,960
some will lose their life
being attacked by predators.

1037
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,080
Japan has
this magnificent nature too.

1038
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,080
It's just as great
as other parts of the world.

1039
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,520
Leader.

1040
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
What is it?

1041
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,720
Next time,

1042
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,160
could I come as the director

1043
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,080
for Miyagawa Expedition?

1044
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,000
No way!

1045
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,240
That's it for Miyagawa Expedition.

1046
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,880
That was great.

1047
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,280
I've learned that even when
a director is promoted,

1048
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,720
it's possible for them
to turn back again.

1049
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,640
Was this edited by Director Kitami?

1050
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,040
No, he didn't.
He went as a team member.

1051
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,760
When I said he was an AD
and he went, "No, I'm a director,"

1052
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,280
he got motivated
from that point onwards.

1053
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,920
So he started to act from
the director's point of view...

1054
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,720
I guess he wanted to give it a try.

1055
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,080
The more he tried,
the more hellish it became...

1056
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,920
That was super funny though.

1057
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,400
But upon this viewing, I believe
the segment needs re-editing.
