8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,080
popular Chinese dish at home, (mapo dofu)

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,678
mapo dofu. (mapo dofu)

10
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,304
Well, mapo dofu

11
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:35,074
is very popular and easy to cook.

12
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:38,304
We can adjust

13
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,716
its hotness as we like.

14
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,152
And more over,

15
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:44,225
it's really suit for rice, I think.

16
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,933
Because it's been cold these days,

17
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,204
we're happy with such hot and warm dish.

18
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:51,217
Well, it's far from some dishes in a pot.

19
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,079
But  both it and mapo dofu

20
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,408
can make you warm.

21
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,919
Now, let's start cooking.

22
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:58,224
First, here's 400 grams of firm tofu. (First, here's 400 grams of firm tofu.)

23
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,225
(400 grams of firm tofu.)

24
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,844
This tofu, (400 grams of firm tofu.)

25
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:03,649
please cut in 1 inch each (400 grams of firm tofu.)

26
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,409
as equal as you can. (400 grams of firm tofu.)

27
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:12,115
Hey, can we use fine-grained tofu?

28
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,250
Well, it's easy to be broken its shape.

29
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,724
So I recommend firm one for mapo dofu.

30
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,390
Firm tofu is suits for mapo dofu.

31
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,588
So, how about tamago-dofu?

32
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,156
Well, it already

33
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,096
has flavor of egg.

34
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:29,826
So it doesn't also suit for mapo dofu.

35
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:30,682
I'm sorry,

36
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:33,512
but tamago-dofu doesn't suit for mapo dofu.

37
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,597
So, how about kouya-dofu?

38
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,272
Oh, it's

39
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:39,182
out of question. (It's out of question.)

40
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,171
I'm sorry. (It's out of question.)

41
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,864
Kouya-dofu is out of question. (Kouya-dofu is out of question.)

42
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,295
Now, prepare hot water

43
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,281
and putting salt to parboil tofu.

44
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:51,129
Please prepare 2/1 teaspoonful of salt. (Salt  2/1 teaspoon)

45
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:51,629
Okay. (Salt  2/1 teaspoon)

46
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:59,475
Hey, you know we write "tofu" as "spoiled bean" in kanji, right?

47
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,266
Don't you feel so good?

48
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:05,891
Well, I feel nothing.

49
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,293
And tofu is a kind of fermented food.

50
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,723
So,I don't feel bad.

51
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:10,573
It's okay.

52
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:13,503
Tofu is a kind of fermented food. (Tofu is a kind of fermented food.)

53
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:16,024
So please feel easy. (So please feel easy.)

54
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,304
Well, now

55
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,373
let's make sauce for tofu.

56
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,723
There're ingredients;

57
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:27,955

61
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:45,812
Hey, if we're not good at chopping green onion,

62
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:48,112
can we put in whole long one?

63
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:50,491
Well, it's too difficult

64
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,861
for us to eat,

65
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,150
so try chopping as possible as you can.

66
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,165
Try chopping green onion as possible as you can. (Try chopping green onion as possible as you can.)

67
00:02:57,616 --> 00:03:01,616
Then, let's heat oil in Chinese wok.

68
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,259
There's 1 tablespoonful of oil here. (There's 1 tablespoonful of oil here.)

69
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:06,262
And (There's 1 tablespoonful of oil here.)

70
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:08,337
minced garlic. (Garlic (chopped))

71
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:11,276
After you catch its smell,

72
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:13,137
add minced meat there. (Minced meat 100g)

73
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:16,998
Hey, what should we do if we can't catch its smell?

74
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,019
Don't worry.

75
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,748
You'll be sure to catch the smell.

76
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:21,056
Don't worry.

77
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,399
You can surely catch the smell.

78
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,624
Then, after heating meat,

79
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,859
add Tobanjan. And after catching its smell, add Tenmenjan.

80
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,020
Hey, what should we do if we can't catch its smell?

81
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,969
Don't worry. You'll be sure to catch the smell.

82
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:38,353
You can see it's heating, right?

83
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,929
You can surely catch the smell. (You can surely catch the smell.)

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,471
Alright.

85
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,496
And, as I told you before,

86
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,967
after heating chopped garlic,

87
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,803
minced meat will be cooked

88
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:53,582
and you can catch the smell. Then, add Tenmenjan.

89
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:57,581
After mix it, add water

90
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,545
and boil them up.

91
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,799
Hey, what should we do if it won't be boiled up?

92
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,203
Well, it's unbelievable.

93
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:06,464
It'll surely get boiled up.

94
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:07,724
I guarantee it.

95
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:09,455

And okay.

97
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:15,776
Now, put tofu.

98
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,271
Because we cook mapo dofu, it's necessary.

99
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,221
Hey, do we need to add tofu?

100
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,148
Sure because it's mapo tofu.

101
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:24,225
You have to put it.

102
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,012
Please

103
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,461
put tofu.

00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:31,922
Then add soy sauce, sake, salt and pepper.

105
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:37,029
Finally add starch with water for thickness.

106
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:39,237
The balance of water and stretch is 1:1.

107
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:44,966
Hey, do we only add thickness this time?

108
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,280
Yes?

109
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:50,001
Are there any netami (jealousy), sonemi (envious) and harami (diaphragm meat) needed? (Are there any netami (jealousy), sonemi (envious) and harami (diaphragm meat) needed?)

110
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:55,050
You know it'll be different dish if you add harami, right?

111
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:02,401
Alright. now

112
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:06,145

00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,295
why do you show this now?

118
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,490
You don't have to

119
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,161
this now.

120
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,930
You don't need it because there's just completed one.

121
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,861
And dishing up,

Well.

127
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:31,215
Now...

128
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:35,904
It's good.

129
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:37,814
Yeah.

130
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:39,094
And its hotness is also good.

131
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,020
It's delicious.

132
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,310
