1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,480
"This programme aired
on 3rd of January, 2021"

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,040
The Quest Calendar Project!

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,480
Yeah!

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,760
Members of The Quest
visit different parts of the world,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,040
and challenge taking
magnificent photographs.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,880
Those photographs are compiled
to create The Quest 2022 calendar.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,920
The Quest Calendar Project.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,920
One day in October, 2020.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,280
It's been a while, but we'll do
the mountain climbing club now.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,960
Let's climb a mountain!

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,720
Nukita, thank you very much.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,840
Your presence here says it all.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,200
- We won't go abroad, right?
- Right.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,880
This time, we'll head to a place
called Kurobe in Toyama.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,920
Does it have something to do
with Kurobe Dam?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They have this secluded area
called Shimonoroka there.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,360
Is that a mountain?

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,120
Shimono hallway?

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,760
Shimonoroka is a secluded area
in Kurobe.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,640
It's in the Eastern area of Toyama.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,400
It starts from Kurobe Dam,
the highest dam in Japan.

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Then they go through Kurobe Gorge,

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,080
the deepest gorge in Japan,
along a 30-kilometre path.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,480
No one entered that area
until the Taisho period.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,680
It's the most secluded area.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,200
It's said to be secluded,
because its hiking season

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,760
is just one month out of a year.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
What? You can only hike there
one month out of the whole year?

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,920
Its trail is only open for a month
from late September to late October.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Some years, you can't even go in.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
It's very much admired
by mountain climbing enthusiasts.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,640
I think the colouring of the leaves
would be beautiful right now.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,120
That's why we're doing it now,

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,840
although it's for
the New Year's special.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,080
By the way, have you been there?

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,360
- When was that? Around 19...
- 19...

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
72?

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,040
I wasn't even born yet.

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
- You weren't born yet?
- No, I wasn't born yet.

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,800
The plan is to take a photograph

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,000
for the calendar at "Odaiko,"
a scenic spot in Shimonoroka.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,560
In addition, they'll head over
to nearby Toyama,

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,360
to Oyama in Tateyama Mountain Range
to get a photograph of the sunrise.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,240
Let's climb to the top and show
a beautiful scenery to everyone.

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,480
I look forward to doing this.
I'll do my best!

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,560
Toyama's secluded area and
the sunrise from the mountain top...

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
How will the first photograph
for the calendar turn out?

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
October, 2020.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,600
Mountain climbing team met at Kurobe
Dam to head out to Shimonoroka.

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,680
This is the New Year's
mountain climbing special.

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,480
This time, we are going to
Shimonoroka in Toyama.

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,320
What do we have to be
cautious about?

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,040
The path is made
by carving out bedrock,

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
so it's very narrow.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,240
So, basically,
we'll travel in a straight line?

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
- We won't walk next to each other.
- Right.

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,080
How will it be for the camera crew?
Would it be hard to film?

58
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
It would be hard to film.

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,320
You can only get the back, right?

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
Most of it would be like that.

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,080
Is that going to be okay?

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,520
This is a special programme.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,720
Imoto has 30 minutes
for her segment.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
If we don't get 30 minutes,
we'll climb a few more mountains.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,080
No, I won't do that!

66
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,560
She ends up going to Shimonoroka and
Oyama in Tateyama Mountain Range,

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,960
but she was hoping of just
going to Shimonoroka this time.

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
Right.

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
No, no, we should get at least
30 minutes' worth of film.

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,840
I figured it would be good if we
could get 10 minutes from here.

71
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,280
Ten minutes?
Do you know how dangerous this is?

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,880
The Ishizakis get some time
for the footage as a couple.

73
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,600
That's funny.

74
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
The camera crew
won't be able to film much.

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Then why did we come here?

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Now, let me explain their climbing
process to Shimonoroka.

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,760
They are currently at the lower part
of Kurobe Dam.

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
They will take a path of

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,920
30 kilometres
along the Kurobe Gorge.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,760
They will spend a night in a tent
on the way.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,640
Their goal is to go to Odaiko,
a scenic spot that's further ahead.

82
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,800
They won't be climbing
to the top of the mountain,

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,520
but they will have magnificent views
at their destination.

84
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,160
By the way, how long are we planning
to walk today?

85
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Twelve to 13 hours.

86
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,480
- That's long!
- That much?

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,960
Right now, my emotional status
is leaning towards the negative,

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
but do you have anything positive
to say that will motivate me to go?

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
What's often said is,

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,520
there are no injuries at Kurobe.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,760
That's great. No injuries in Kurobe?

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,960
That's a nice phrase.

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,480
They have no injuries,

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
but when you fall,

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
Oh?

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,680
it's way beyond an injury.

97
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,480
That's one horrible information.

98
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,440
What, they say that
about this place?

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,000
It's so you don't get injured.
It's either you die or you live?

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,240
Terrifying Shimonoroka,

101
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,000
what kind of a place is it?

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,400
Let's do our best.

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,320
Let's go with safety first.

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,960
They start off walking
in a narrow forest trail.

105
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Amazing, the leaves have

106
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,680
changed their colours.

107
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,640
It's beautiful.
Look at that rock surface.

108
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
It doesn't seem that demanding.

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,480
- I'm thinking it's a hallway.
- It's a hallway.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,080
This is the deepest gorge in Japan
surrounded by mountains,

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,200
of 3,000 metres in elevation.

112
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,720
Their course is obstructed
by treacherous ground.

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,000
I thought it was different
from an ordinary mountain.

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,840
The first thing that popped
into my eyes was

115
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,560
a sign at the entrance that said,
"Frequent fatal accidents."

116
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,960
That freaked me out.

117
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,480
This is super scary.

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
Frequent fatal accidents.

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,680
It says walking while doing
other things is dangerous.

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,480
Like while you are talking,
or while you're enjoying the view,

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,440
and while you're taking a picture.
It's dangerous, so don't do it.

122
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,720
Then what are we going there for?

123
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,680
Are we going to be okay here?

124
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,960
We'll be doing everything
we shouldn't do.

125
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
It was very unusual in 2019,

126
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,160
they had five fatal accidents
in 11 days.

127
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,640
An elderly person
should never go there alone.

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,400
What if other shows asked you
to take them as well?

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,520
I won't. I'll refuse.

130
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,520
The Quest's mountain climbing club's

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
teamwork of over 10 years,

132
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,160
I mean, there's history.
There's experience.

133
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
It would be impossible for
the other shows. It's impossible.

134
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,800
The dreadfulness of Shimonoroka
is gradually revealed.

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,680
That's something else.
We'll be walking that area.

136
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,920
- It's like walking along the cliff.
- It's not a path.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,120
That's one scary path.

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,440
This is dangerous.

139
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,240
- They don't have any railing?
- They have nothing.

140
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,640
This is a completely different path
from regular mountain climbing.

141
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
From this point onwards, they'll
observe the rapids on their right

142
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,760
while walking along a V-shaped
precipitous cliff.

143
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,240
That's scary.

144
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,280
They don't have any fence
for sliding prevention.

145
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
The only thing they have is...

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,360
- This is the support I mentioned.
- This?

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
- This?
- Yes.

148
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,880
I feel super uneasy.

149
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
This thin four millimetres wire

150
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
placed at random places
are the safety tethers.

151
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Even so,
we should definitely hold it.

152
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm going to put my whole weight
on this?

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
- It's dangerous.
- It is.

154
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,320
- Let's be cautious.
- Yes.

155
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,040
Why is there a thin path
in this deep gorge to start with?

156
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,680
It was about 100 years ago.

157
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,280
Power companies from back then
dispatched men

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
to determine the feasibility
of building a dam here.

159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,520
They spent nine years

160
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,880
to build Shimonoroka,

161
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,680
a path that's wide enough for
one person in this secluded area.

162
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,720
That's incredible.

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
It then became popular
as a mountain climbing path

164
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,000
because of this rare scenery.

165
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,160
What a superb view.

166
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,120
It could be in a PV.

167
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,800
This gorge, rocks,

168
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,680
and the autumn leaves,

169
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,240
create such beautiful scenery.

170
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,280
The path they take
isn't always levelled.

171
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,320
This is not what I expected
from this hallway.

172
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,120
I thought the path
would be more like a hallway.

173
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,960
Unexpectedly,

174
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,240
I was told we'll be descending,
but we're ascending right now.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,040
Overall route descends,

176
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,520
but as you see,
it repeats going up and down.

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
That's tough.

178
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,240
In addition, this narrow path.

179
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,680
It requires physical strength
as well as strong focus.

180
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
No injuries in Kurobe.

181
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,600
I get it now.

182
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
Then...

183
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,920
Someone is coming.
A group is coming.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,200
These are our support members.

185
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,120
They each carry about
20 kilogrammes of baggage

186
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,800
- to support the team.
- Thank you very much.

187
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
Thank you.

188
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,960
Do you understand how this requires
thorough preparation?

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,000
There's still some snow left.

190
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,520
It doesn't melt in the summer.

191
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,240
It melts during the summer?

192
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
No, there's more during the summer.

193
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
The least amount of snow is seen
during autumn.

194
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,120
Oh, is that how it is?

195
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,960
It'll snow
before these are all gone.

196
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,240
- That's when we can climb here?
- Yes.

197
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,160
It really is limited
during the year.

198
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
Wow, this is scary!

199
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Three hours since they started,

200
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,400
they now head to the core
of Shimonoroka.

201
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,480
You only have your hands.

202
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
- This is scary.
- No!

203
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,400
The only support are your own legs
and a thin wire along the rock wall.

204
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,920
This is scary!

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,280
You've got to be kidding me.

206
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Now, we climb up a ladder.

207
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,440
The ladder is perpendicular
to the ground.

208
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,000
A log ladder is placed at locations
where a path couldn't be made.

209
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,480
It's better not to look down.

210
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,160
Wow, it's high!

211
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,400
This height is scary.

212
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
At the same time,

213
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,640
the determination of those men who
cleared this path is astonishing.

214
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
- Seriously.
- This is amazing.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,840
After walking for five hours,

216
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,320
they arrived at Kurobebessantani,
six kilometres away from the start.

217
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,720
Okay. Be alert. It's a danger zone.

218
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,280
From here, it's said to be the most
dangerous area of their route.

219
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Five hours since they started,

220
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,840
they arrived at Kurobebessantani,
six kilometres away from the start.

221
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,240
Okay. Be alert. It's a danger zone.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,160
From here, it's said to be the most
dangerous area of their route.

223
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,760
This can't be just 10 minutes.

224
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,480
This is super scary.
The rocks are slippery, too.

225
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
The path is 50 centimetres wide.

226
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
Letting your guard down for a second
could be fatal.

227
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,280
- That's not a path.
- I know.

228
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,240
By the way,

229
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,600
I have no ropes attached to me.

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
How come Ishizaki is the only one

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,480
with all that?
They're looking after him.

232
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,840
That much?

233
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,400
They are taking care of the husband,
but the wife is on her own.

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
That's not the show's decision,

235
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,640
but the Ishizakis' decision.

236
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,440
This is super scary.

237
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,600
For the next three kilometres,
this is how the path is going to be.

238
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,520
That's narrow.

239
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,600
It's so high up.

240
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
How much is this?

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,800
That's amazing.

242
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,040
It's about 100 metres.

243
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,840
It's almost 100 metres, right?

244
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,680
It sucks you in.

245
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,880
This part is no joke either.

246
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,120
The ceiling is low here, too.

247
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Watch your head, too.

248
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
You shouldn't just pay attention
to your feet.

249
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,880
Accidents could occur

250
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,000
from helmets and backpacks
hitting the rocks.

251
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
This is scary.

252
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
I have to stay alert.

253
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,800
That's something else.

254
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,520
However, this impressive
panoramic view

255
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,120
shows how wonderful
nature's environment is in Japan.

256
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,360
- Amazing!
- It's beautiful.

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
This is so cool.

258
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
Amazing. Japan is amazing!

259
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,120
This path is dreadful,
but what's even more dreadful is...

260
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
What?

261
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,120
From this point on,
it's just a simple repetition

262
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,520
of what we've shown so far.

263
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,480
It's "same as above,"
and it won't make the final footage.

264
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,600
After they've walked for 13 hours,

265
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,920
they arrive at their destination
at a cabin to spend the night.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
We are here
at Asohara Hot Springs cabin.

267
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,240
Cabin is closed during this season,

268
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,160
so we'll spend the night in a tent,

269
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,040
and we'll leave for the second half
of the climb tomorrow.

270
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,560
So is this what you look forward to,

271
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
as it says here?

272
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
Hot springs.

273
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,120
There's a hot spring here?

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,400
- It feels nice.
- She's in it already?

275
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
It's heaven.

276
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,000
This is heaven.

277
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,440
You all took a bath together?

278
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
- This is so extravagant.
- Why?

279
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,120
Why do I have to enjoy it

280
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
with all these mountaineers?

281
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,000
This really is a treat.

282
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
Yes, it is.

283
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,520
Not everyone can make it here.

284
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,800
It's a treat. Only the one
who walked the path can enjoy this.

285
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,360
- Good work. Thank you very much.
- Good work.

286
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,240
We took our bath,
and it's time for dinner.

287
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,240
- That's the best.
- Tonight's dinner is

288
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,480
Tonjiru soup made by the owner
of the cabin.

289
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
That's the best.

290
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,680
It's super delicious!

291
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,200
It's so delicious I want to cry.

292
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,240
This is nice.

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,000
We've been trying too many
winter mountains before.

294
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Are we above heaven?

295
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,880
- It's paradise.
- It's paradise.

296
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
Don't die.

297
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,200
The second day of mountain climbing.

298
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
This is the second half.

299
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,160
The gorge is wider today, and we'll
enjoy the scenery on the right.

300
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,760
I think the autumn leaves
will be pretty with colours.

301
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,200
It's more open,
so you can use a drone to film it.

302
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,920
Right, I want to use the drone.

303
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,880
They are approximately
five kilometres to Odaiko,

304
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,640
their scenic spot.

305
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,840
They'll challenge to get the best
photograph for the calendar.

306
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,680
The path is starting to look
different.

307
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,400
This path looks like
it's carved out of a rock.

308
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,920
This is not naturally made.

309
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,120
It's definitely man-made.

310
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,680
A stretch of road
on the face of a mountain

311
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,080
was made by people
about 100 years ago,

312
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,760
by carving rocks off the mountain.

313
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,600
It's called the horizontal trail.

314
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,280
It stretches over 13.6 kilometres.

315
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,440
I think we'll be at Odaiko soon.

316
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
And the best scenic spot

317
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,360
on the horizontal trail is here,

318
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,520
at their destination, Odaiko.

319
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,920
Amazing.

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
We'll just use this part
from this trip.

321
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,920
What are you saying?

322
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is the only part we can use?

323
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
We came to capture this.

324
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,560
Well, yes.

325
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,880
This is amazing.

326
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
On the right...

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,640
This is no joke. I'm nervous.

328
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
This is scary.

329
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,520
Wow, be careful over here.

330
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
This is so high! It's so scary.

331
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,360
It's scary!

332
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,040
A path made by carving out a cliff

333
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,680
that symbolises Kurobe Gorge.

334
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,120
In terms of a high-rise, I think
it's higher than Nippon TV building.

335
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,640
It really is a path
made by carving out the rocks.

336
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,240
It's for one person only.

337
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,120
This is dangerous.

338
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,360
It doesn't have any safety railing
or anything.

339
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,120
You only have your own feet,

340
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,680
and a support of your own hands.

341
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,800
This really is the path
of self-reliance.

342
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,680
Changing autumn leaves add colour
to the cliff and the gorge.

343
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,240
We took a potential picture
for the calendar with a drone.

344
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
"Ayako Imoto in Toyama,
Odaigo at Shimonoroka"

345
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,720
It's tiny.

346
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,960
"Secluded area
of Shimonoroka Odaiko"

347
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
That path was something else.

348
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,920
Scary!

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,880
- That's amazing.
- Take a look at that.

350
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,200
Nukita, be careful!

351
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,840
It's more scarier
to watch the others.

352
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,240
But because of that,

353
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,640
you get to enjoy
the biggest rock wall in Japan,

354
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,600
and the gorge.

355
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,080
This concludes the two-day
mountain climbing of Shimonoroka.

356
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,760
The total distance travelled
was 30 kilometres.

357
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,040
They walked a total of 23 hours.

358
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I'm exhausted.
This hot springs is great.

359
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,720
- You went again?
- It was really long.

360
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,840
What shall we do next?

361
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,320
Wait one second.

362
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,600
This won't do?
Shimonoroka is not good enough?

363
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
We walked for 23 hours.

364
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,600
But can't make it
into a 30-minute footage?

365
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,720
That's a major problem.

366
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,000
They walked for 23 hours,

367
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,080
but the mountain climbing footage
is just 14 minutes up to this point.

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,360
It was filmed,
but only one percent of it was used.

369
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,560
We walked this much.

370
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,120
I'm going to tell Uchimura
as soon as we get back.

371
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,800
I'm going to say something.

372
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm going to have Uchimura
handle it.

373
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,560
I'm going to have the superiors
say it.

374
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,600
Could you say,
"Please watch the second half?"

375
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,080
I don't want to.

376
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,040
Mountain climbing special...

377
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,360
Please watch the second half.

378
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
Go ahead.

379
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,640
Oh, we're here.

380
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,160
We're here.

381
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,000
What is this place?

382
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,280
What's with this view?

383
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,600
It's all snow here!

384
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,840
They came to Tateyama Mountain Range
in Toyama.

385
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,640
Their challenge is to get a picture
of the sunrise at the summit.

386
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,320
Hello, everyone. It's been a month
since I went to Shimonoroka.

387
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,040
That time, autumn leaves were
beautiful with colours, but look.

388
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm here on a snowy mountain
right now.

389
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,320
It didn't work?
We didn't have enough time?

390
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,920
- No.
- We didn't?

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
I did my research.

392
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,960
I searched for old footage
of Shimonoroka,

393
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,080
but my judgement is that Shimonoroka
doesn't have much material.

394
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,000
That path has horrible
cost performance.

395
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,360
Nakajima, our camera crew
went to Shimonoroka,

396
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,520
and he was a victim as well.

397
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,920
You went there a week before us?
For a show?

398
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,120
I went filming quite a lot,

399
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,040
but it only came out
to three minutes.

400
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,840
Three minutes?

401
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
Let's not go there anymore.

402
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,440
We learned our lesson.

403
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,320
Shimonoroka won't produce
enough minutes.

404
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
So which summit are we climbing
to see the sunrise?

405
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,440
- It's behind us.
- Behind us.

406
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,680
Didn't we go there in the past?
It's Oyama.

407
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,720
I know that one.
It'll probably be fast.

408
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,480
It snowed, so it will be easier.

409
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,920
I see.

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,880
I think that won't have
enough minutes either.

411
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,680
I think we'll be on the summit,
just like that.

412
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
I think that's how tough
this mountain is.

413
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,400
They will stay at Tateyama Murodo
Sanso located at the foot of Oyama.

414
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,600
They will depart before dawn

415
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,720
to climb to Oyama's summit
at 3,003 metres

416
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
to see the sunrise.

417
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,040
However, 2:00 in the morning.

418
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,480
The weather suddenly changes
as they prepare to leave.

419
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,800
Right, it's going to rain.

420
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
It's starting to rain.

421
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
It's unfortunate, but we can't do
anything about it today.

422
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,760
They are here for the sunrise.

423
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,680
They'll have to wait for the weather
to improve.

424
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,400
However, they don't have much else
to do, so let's do this segment.

425
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,200
The Quest's
Let's Go Mountain Climbing!

426
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,840
We will present climbing items
recommended by Kuraoka, the guide.

427
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,360
What is this?

428
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,280
What?

429
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,520
- It's made of a mesh material.
- What is this?

430
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,920
It's a shirt.

431
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,720
It looks very indecent.

432
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,560
This shirt is very hot
among mountaineers.

433
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
It's "drynamic" mesh.

434
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,920
It's a mesh undershirt
that keeps skin dry,

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
and maintains body temperature.

436
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,240
It's a shirt that could be worn
every season.

437
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,680
When you layer
and climb a mountain in winter,

438
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,880
- you sweat.
- You do sweat.

439
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,560
This keeps you dry,
so you don't get cold.

440
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,480
I see.

441
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,800
- You can wear it in summer, too.
- That's awesome.

442
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
Divine gramps loves it, too.

443
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,920
Hey, it needs to be blurred!
This isn't allowed.

444
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Your body is super fit
for a 69-year-old.

445
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,040
You can see his chest
through the mesh.

446
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,960
I should put bandages on here.

447
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,000
- No.
- So loud.

448
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
The weather improved two days later.

449
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,520
We can finally go.

450
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,000
We had to wait a total of two days
since we've arrived here.

451
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,440
We can see the stars,
so I believe the weather is clear.

452
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,640
I wonder what the conditions
are like.

453
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,760
It'll be windier
as you go up an altitude.

454
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,800
I see.

455
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,960
We're just concerned about the wind
when we get up there.

456
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,160
She thought it'd be an easy climb,

457
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,600
but the climb itself
was not what she expected.

458
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,080
This is horrible.

459
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,280
This is no joke.

460
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,960
No joke.

461
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,120
This is hell.

462
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,320
It's cold.

463
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,720
As they reach the summit,
the wind becomes stronger than ever.

464
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,080
I can't open my eyes.

465
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,080
Sensible temperature
is minus 15 degrees Celsius.

466
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
That's hell.

467
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,840
My eyes hurt. My eyes hurt.

468
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,800
Wind is blowing
at 18 metres per second.

469
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,040
The wind velocity
is as fast as a typhoon's.

470
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,800
I'll be blown away.

471
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Looking back, she said this
at the base of the mountain.

472
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,600
I don't think we'll have
enough minutes.

473
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,240
I think we'll be on the summit,
just like that.

474
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
I think that's how tough
this mountain is.

475
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,680
She thought it was going to be
an easy hike,

476
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,480
but it ended up being harsh,
just like in the Himalayas.

477
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,640
This is hell.

478
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,360
Wind...

479
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,280
Oh, no. Oh, no.

480
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
It's cold.

481
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,960
They'll have to endure it for now,

482
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,360
believing that there's sunrise
ahead of them.

483
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,200
It's no joke.

484
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,600
The sky is gradually turning red.

485
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,520
I don't see any clouds yet.

486
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
That's amazing.

487
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,680
With all we've been through....

488
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,840
Come on out, sun.

489
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,880
Quarter to six in the morning,

490
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,720
they get past the heavy wind
and arrive at the summit.

491
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,800
They'll dodge the wind at the shrine
on the summit, until the sun rises.

492
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
What do we do?

493
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,600
It's no joke.

494
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,680
Thanks to all your efforts,

495
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,040
I think we can get a great picture.

496
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,720
A great picture will be taken.

497
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,880
The view seems great,
but the wind...

498
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,880
But because of this wind,
the clouds are being blown away.

499
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,120
The view might be great.

500
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,280
If I were able
to come here casually,

501
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,200
then I would be like,
"This is awesome!"

502
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,920
I get it now.

503
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,680
Considering all the hell we've been
through, we need to see this.

504
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
And at 24 past six in the morning,

505
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,480
it's finally time!

506
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,680
There it is!

507
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,120
The sun is rising now!

508
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
It's beautiful.

509
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,120
Sun rises and shines
on frozen mountains.

510
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,400
Swirling snow makes it look
even more beautiful.

511
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,320
There is hardly a cloud.

512
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,160
This is quite beautiful.

513
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,040
It's extremely beautiful.

514
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,240
Can you see Mount Fuji
towards the right?

515
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,440
This is rare.

516
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,840
You can't see Mount Fuji from Oyama
unless you're very lucky.

517
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,120
This is great. It's getting light.

518
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,120
This is one amazing sunrise
from the mountaintop.

519
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,960
It's an authentic sunrise
from the mountaintop.

520
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,720
Recently, I haven't been
very emotional

521
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,360
when I went mountain climbing,
so I appreciate it.

522
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,200
The spray of snow is awesome.
It almost hides the sun.

523
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,400
It's dreamy.

524
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,520
This is from a time-lapse video.

525
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,800
They overcome
the trying blowing wind

526
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,680
to see the warm light
in the far distance.

527
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,440
This is definitely a superb view
you'd want to see in 2021.

528
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm so glad we were able
to show this beautiful scenery.

529
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,240
This view is quite rare.

530
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
I'm glad we were able to deliver
this rare, magnificent view.

531
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,680
I believe we now we have enough
for New Year's Special,

532
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,840
and Mountain Climbing Special.

533
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,360
They take a picture for the calendar
with the best sunrise.

534
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,360
This is the sunrise
we deliver to you in 2021.

535
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,240
That's it
for The Quest Calendar Project

536
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,800
by the mountain climbing club.

537
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,240
- Good work.
- That sunrise was great.

538
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,840
- You climbed twice.
- Who knew

539
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,400
that I'd be climbing two mountains?

540
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,880
Yurina, what did you think?

541
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,080
I know that I shouldn't take
mountain climbing lightly,

542
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,080
but I like height
and dangerous places.

543
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,440
- Oh?
- What?

544
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm a little interested.

545
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,080
- Should you say that?
- When you say that...

546
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,880
- They just heard her, right?
- That's not good. The staff here

547
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,000
are really crazy, so...

548
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,160
Really, they'll seriously
make you an offer.

549
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,600
Let's move on.
Take it away, Tetsuro.

550
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,240
Okay. Next up is this.

551
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,200
Female comedians, talent camp.

552
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah!

553
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
So it's a talent camp.

554
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,200
Female comedians
are in a different studio.

555
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,320
- Oh, that's their outfit?
- Hello!

556
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,080
We're all here!

557
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,720
Every one of them is cute.

558
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,160
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

559
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,520
Where did you go this time, Asako?

560
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,280
This time, we went to Tochigi,

561
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,840
and did this challenge.

562
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,080
No matter how I look at it,
those are cheerleading outfits.

563
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,680
You never know.

564
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,880
Is that an outfit
for your challenge this time?

565
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,200
Yes, it's unbelievable that
we blend in with the background.

566
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,840
- It's hard to tell apart.
- The red and white.

567
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm more curious about your taping
than your outfits.

568
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,040
You can see that?

569
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,440
Your outfit is for cheerleading,

570
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,480
but your hands are those of
a sumo wrestler.

571
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,280
It's not just our hands.

572
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,880
Our knees and shoulders
are hurt, too.

573
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,920
This time, we will do a performance
to show our accomplishments.

574
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,280
Please look forward to it.

575
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,120
Let's get going then.

576
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,080
- The Quest!
- The Quest!

577
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

578
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,560
Two-and-a-half-hour drive
from Shiodome,

579
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
Hot Springs Club special edition.

580
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,640
Female comedians,
talent camp in Tochigi.

581
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,520
They came to Nikko Toshogu,
a world heritage site.

582
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,120
We are here in Tochigi!

583
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,320
Female comedian group is here.

584
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,240
It's been a while.

585
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
We opened up at Nikko Toshogu
for Tochigi.

586
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,000
- It's wonderful.
- We are inside.

587
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
The Tochigi.

588
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm glad you all came.

589
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,800
What?

590
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,920
- Well, I'm from Tochigi.
- That's right.

591
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,880
- That's right.
- Oh...

592
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Welcome home.

593
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,520
Lots of them are here
for the first time, too.

594
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,120
It was the least charming prefecture
of Japan in 2020.

595
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,440
This was ranked last although
they have this magnificent place?

596
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,200
Exactly! Take a look.

597
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,360
It's best not to rush it.

598
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
- Oh, you're from Ibaraki.
- Ibaraki!

599
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,760
That's unseemly.

600
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,960
Darn it! We'll finish this off

601
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,440
in "Kenmin show!"

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,920
So, what are we doing this time?

603
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
This time, you'll wave flags around.

604
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Flags?

605
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,440
Like as in flag signalling?

606
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,440
Is it possibly

607
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
where we do back flips
while we wave flags around?

608
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,520
What did you say?

609
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,840
- What do you mean?
- Ganbareruya will do it.

610
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
What is it?

611
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,360
I just stood out a little for now.

612
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,040
Now, Tochigi art talent camp starts!

613
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,360
They will be practising
at New Sunpia Tochigi for camp.

614
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,400
It will be taught by a dance
drill team, Pink Diamonds.

615
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,920
Is it like a marching band?

616
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,920
You twirl it,

617
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,320
and throw it in the air.

618
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,040
- You throw them?
- Yes.

619
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,360
It has a ball-shaped thing
attached to the flag.

620
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,520
I've never seen that before.

621
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,080
Is it like a twirling baton?

622
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,760
It's called a short flag baton.

623
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,800
A short flag baton?

624
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,920
Please watch the demonstration
of short flag baton.

625
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,680
They threw it in the air
from the start!

626
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,840
Wow!

627
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,360
Short flag started
in the United States.

628
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,560
It's a performance that combines
twirling batons and flags.

629
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,680
Amazing!

630
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,880
This is incredible.

631
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh, that's pretty.

632
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
- This is no joke.
- It's no joke.

633
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,680
What is this technique?

634
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,720
How do you twirl it? It's amazing!

635
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,840
Wow, it's amazing!

636
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,640
If we could do that in sync,
it would be cool.

637
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,560
It's super cute.

638
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,680
We'll have you challenge this.

639
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,560
This was awesome to watch.

640
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,040
I think their shoulders
are dislocated.

641
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,480
Let's start with basic skills
for short flag.

642
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,800
Tomomi Hanzawa will be
their instructor.

643
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,760
They will use
two flag twirling batons.

644
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,720
A round grip is attached at the end
of an aluminium shaft.

645
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,400
- This is quite heavy.
- It's heavy.

646
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,600
It weight about 200 grams.
It's quite heavy.

647
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,840
You support the flag
with your index finger.

648
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,000
First, they'll learn the shape
of the arms,

649
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,840
and a basic movement
called "arm motion".

650
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,280
If this doesn't line up,
it doesn't look good.

651
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
You don't move your elbows
like this.

652
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,680
You lower it
with your elbows straight.

653
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,560
- That's hard.
- Lower with straight elbows?

654
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
It's hard not to bend your elbows.

655
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
What?

656
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,160
Instructor, it's impossible
unless you tighten your butt.

657
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,640
"It's impossible
unless you tighten your butt"

658
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,400
When I looked at the front row,
their butt was tightened.

659
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,480
It's really tight.

660
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,840
Next, is how to wave a flag.

661
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,960
You go down first,

662
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
and turn it to the back.

663
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,280
It's like dropping the wrist.

664
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,240
This is hard to do at first.

665
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,840
Oh, it hurts.

666
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,720
- My shoulders.
- My shoulders are hurting.

667
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,760
I see. I see.

668
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,440
And the biggest obstacle
is the left hand.

669
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,440
I can't rotate with my left hand
at all.

670
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,320
My left hand won't turn at all.

671
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,760
What are we going to do with this?

672
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,720
My elbow and wrists
aren't compatible at all.

673
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,720
What is this?

674
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,080
In addition, both hands have to do
the same movement equally.

675
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,960
That's difficult.

676
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
First up is Asako.

677
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,960
- What? Amazing.
- That's amazing.

678
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,400
- She's doing it.
- She's good at these things.

679
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,560
I don't know how she does it.

680
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,800
She's amazing, although she's 50.

681
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,000
Amazing.

682
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,640
- She's older than Nobunaga.
- The way she said that...

683
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,440
Don't compare me to Nobunaga
all the time.

684
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,560
He's a human, too.

685
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,480
Her back is itching.

686
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,400
Shut up!

687
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,520
I can't concentrate!
I'm thinking while I'm doing this!

688
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,840
In the meantime, Ocarina is...

689
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,760
To the back.

690
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,920
an alien semaphoring to a UFO.

691
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,560
Hey!

692
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,960
She's communicating with them.

693
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,720
Now, they'll learn different moves

694
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
for the final routine.

695
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,440
However, the left hand
is the biggest obstacle.

696
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,840
I can't imagine being able
to do this at the same time.

697
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,120
They also have to learn
the throwing techniques.

698
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,280
That's fast.

699
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,400
Front! That's it!

700
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,120
- Everyone.
- Yes?

701
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,840
Shall we refresh for a while?

702
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,120
I'm glad to hear that.

703
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,520
They will divide into two groups
to share Tochigi's tourist spots.

704
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,960
One group went to Nasu Highlands.

705
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,280
This is heaven.

706
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,880
They came to a popular spot,
Nasu Trick Art Museum.

707
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,120
Is this the entrance?

708
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,680
- Really?
- This is a drawing.

709
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,640
- This is trick art.
- Don't be fooled by it!

710
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,760
It's cute.

711
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,480
Inside is a strange place.

712
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,000
- A bear!
- Human raised by a bear?

713
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,560
Right, a person raised by a bear.

714
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,560
It's packed with Instagenic art!

715
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,720
That hair type is Asako Ito.

716
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,560
Good morning.

717
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,320
Why do short people do that?

718
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,560
Right.

719
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,920
This is a room of mirrors.

720
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,280
I'm exhausted.

721
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,560
- Creepy.
- What?

722
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,720
- Oh, no!
- How does that work?

723
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,240
Was I...

724
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,520
this old-looking?

725
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,800
The other team
is at Kinu Green Park.

726
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,840
It's a popular park
with athletic equipment over water.

727
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,600
It's very popular in summer,

728
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,880
but they don't have much visitors
during this season.

729
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,400
- Of course.
- That's a given.

730
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,040
Now, let's take a look at
their water athletics performance.

731
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,800
- Go for it!
- First up, YuiP.

732
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,280
She's walking.
Her feet are on the ground.

733
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,320
- That's the ground.
- Is that your style?

734
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,120
- Are you sure that's okay?
- No way.

735
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,880
Oh, no!

736
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh...

737
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,120
- She's in the water!
- YuiP, you're in the water!

738
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,280
- YuiP, I'm not in the water, right?
- YuiP, you're in the water!

739
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
You're in the water!

740
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,480
Next, it's Yoshiko.

741
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,880
This is scary.

742
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,680
You need physical strength
and grasping power.

743
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,120
- So flexible.
- You're flexible.

744
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,320
Oh, no!
She has a rope on her crotch.

745
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,240
Her crotch!

746
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Just like that...

747
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,280
It's exposed.

748
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,320
- It's exposed!
- How do you explain that fall?

749
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,600
- Wow!
- It's all-star.

750
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,160
No!

751
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,000
She looks like Momiji Yamamura.

752
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,040
I'll go.

753
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Ocarina attempts to cross
on a barrel.

754
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,360
- Come on.
- It really shakes.

755
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,880
- It's at a diagonal angle.
- What is this?

756
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,920
It's tilted.

757
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,840
Amazing!

758
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,760
Successful!

759
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,000
Amazing!

760
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,520
She looks super happy.

761
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,160
- That was fast.
- They start to practise again.

762
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,280
That's fast.

763
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,600
Once again, Kawamura
is less talented than the others.

764
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,760
It's difficult.

765
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,200
It's like a broken flower rock.

766
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
My pointer finger
won't move like I want it to.

767
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,080
Why don't you just play with it
at first?

768
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,400
Like so. Don't worry about
the finger and turn it for now.

769
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
You need to be friends
with the twirling baton.

770
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,280
I got it.

771
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,000
- It might be a problem this time.
- Don't cry.

772
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,160
What do I turn to practise?

773
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
The instructor said
it's the centrifugal force,

774
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,360
so I looked it up.

775
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,320
"Centrifugal force is

776
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,280
an inertial force that appears
to act on all objects,

777
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,600
when viewed from a rotating frame
of reference."

778
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
I'm even more confused now.

779
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,600
Second day of camp.

780
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,600
On the second day, they will learn
more difficult skills.

781
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,960
They will also practise
their formation.

782
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,880
Short twirl flag
is a group performance.

783
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,720
When the right side goes by,
you chase after it.

784
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,640
Everyone's movements compile
to make up the technique.

785
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,200
Wait.

786
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
They struggled
with the throwing techniques.

787
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,320
One, two, three, four, five.

788
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,600
This is the highlight of their
routine where they take turns

789
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,800
throwing it in the air and catching,

790
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
but success rate
is less than 50 percent.

791
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,480
Yakko's struggling with joint pain.

792
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,880
This hurts.

793
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,400
It hurts when I squat down.

794
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,880
- Oshima on the other hand is...
- Oh?

795
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,040
Oshima?

796
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,600
Are you okay?

797
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,400
- What's the matter?
- Can I do something for you?

798
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,200
I'm starving.

799
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,760
So they came to a rice field.

800
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,560
- Welcome!
- What?

801
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,280
Welcome to Otahara, Tochigi!

802
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,600
Welcome.

803
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,600
My other job is this.

804
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,760
I'm an ambassador for Otawara.

805
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,680
- That's where she's from.
- Nine years ago,

806
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,720
Oshima took a post as an ambassador
for Otawara.

807
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,240
This time,

808
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,440
it's an Otawara gourmet tour
recommended by the ambassador.

809
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,360
We have four destinations.

810
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,800
- Oh...
- How grand.

811
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,800
But because of how things are now,

812
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,000
we'll split up and go.

813
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,040
They will go to four destinations
in groups of three.

814
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,240
Highlight is Otawara beef steak.

815
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,600
They'll catch a jet balloon
for a steak.

816
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,200
Only three of them can eat it.

817
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,400
That's harsh.

818
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
Wait!

819
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,160
When meat is at stake,
Yashiro is suddenly quick.

820
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes!

821
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,120
Second balloon.

822
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,600
All of them chasing after a balloon

823
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,360
is like criminals
chasing after a string in hell.

824
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,360
Yes!

825
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Kurosawa is showing
her presence now.

826
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,400
There's one more spot for the steak.

827
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,840
- It's fast!
- Oh, not yet!

828
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Yes!

829
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,280
Fat ones are extremely obsessed
with meat.

830
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Yes!

831
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,800
Now, let's start
the Otawara gourmet tour!

832
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,320
First, it's Oshima's
memorable natural ingredient.

833
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,360
What is it?

834
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,880
Okay.

835
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,840
We see it now.

836
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,480
We don't see it at all.

837
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,200
We see Otawara gourmet now.

838
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,120
I don't see it.

839
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,440
I have no clue.

840
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,120
What? Persimmons?

841
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,000
You're right.

842
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
It looks delicious.

843
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,840
Isn't its colour beautiful?

844
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,240
It wasn't what I expected,
so I'm perplexed.

845
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,520
Really?

846
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,520
They each picked one
delicious-looking persimmon.

847
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,640
Nice catch!

848
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,560
Let's eat!

849
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
Isn't it astringent?

850
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,480
These are astringent persimmons.

851
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,720
I made the same mistake
over and over again

852
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
when I was in middle school.

853
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
Didn't it look super delicious?

854
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,040
Next is a bowl
recommended by Oshima.

855
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,360
Oh, it says "Wakuwaku ramen".

856
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,520
- Yes.
- That looks delicious.

857
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,320
- Is that Oshima?
- Yes, that's me.

858
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,720
- Oshima?
- Yes, that's me.

859
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,360
The owner asked me,

860
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,680
"Can I make a poster of this size?"

861
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,600
This was it.

862
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,880
- It wasn't what you expected.
- It was completely different.

863
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,160
It looks like vomit.

864
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,080
No!

865
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,600
How could you say that
in front of the owner?

866
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,120
It's fine. He's laughing.

867
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,600
Oshima loved this dish so much

868
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,040
that she travelled 40 minutes for it
in high school.

869
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,440
This is the meat bowl.

870
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,120
Oh, a vomit?

871
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,400
- Right?
- It's someone who drank too much.

872
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,440
How does it taste?

873
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
What do you think?

874
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,880
- It's delicious!
- Yes!

875
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,120
I'm so happy!

876
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,720
- What is this?
- Then...

877
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,520
- Isn't it delicious?
- It's delicious.

878
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,120
She's so touched
by the memorable taste.

879
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,280
That's great.

880
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,480
I couldn't say anything.

881
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,720
Good for you.

882
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,880
Good for you.

883
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,320
Next is the highest grade steak.

884
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,160
This is "Gyucho,"
Otawara beef speciality restaurant.

885
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,320
Filet is 150 grams
and about this size,

886
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,960
and it costs 52,000 yen.

887
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,560
Let's get that.

888
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
- Are you sure?
- 52,000 yen!

889
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,000
One, two, three.

890
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,120
The three of you will share a steak.

891
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Oh...

892
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,960
Let's see
if there's a cheaper steak.

893
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,760
Cheaper one is fine,
so we can eat one each.

894
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,480
Fat ones choose quantity
over quality.

895
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,320
This is the super special
filet steak.

896
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,000
It costs 52,000 yen.

897
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,680
How does the Otawara beef,
the first rate Japanese beef, taste?

898
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,480
- It's 12,000 yen.
- It's 12,000 yen?

899
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,440
Oh...

900
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,120
It's tender!

901
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,720
- That's too fast.
- It's seriously delicious.

902
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,480
- I'm done with it already.
- I'll go for it.

903
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,160
You must be starving still.

904
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,360
- I'm still starving.
- I'm hungry even more.

905
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,680
The last one
is a super spicy gourmet.

906
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,360
Otawara is the number one producer
of chilli peppers in Japan.

907
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,840
Its spiciness could be tasted at

908
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,880
Oryu, a Chinese cuisine restaurant.

909
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,960
Their speciality is this,
chilli pepper ramen.

910
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,840
Its spiciness level is 10.

911
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,520
What? That's no joke.

912
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,840
Its colour is...

913
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
It's the paste type.

914
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,520
It's like a rubber.

915
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,720
- It's like a rubber band.
- This is a rubber band.

916
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,000
This is a special spicy noodles
with chilli pepper mixed in it.

917
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,480
So it's all spicy.

918
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,240
Its soup has super spicy spice,
their secret recipe.

919
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,600
Loads of chilli peppers
from Otawara are used.

920
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,440
Let's taste the spiciness!

921
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,000
It's spicy!

922
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,440
It's spicy!

923
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,000
This spiciness hits you fast!

924
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,960
You can't slurp it.

925
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,120
On the other hand,
Barbie who loves spicy food is...

926
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,280
This part of me is strong.

927
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,960
Really?

928
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,520
She looks like she can handle it.

929
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,760
Amazing!

930
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,520
- Amazing!
- I'm impressed.

931
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
It feels good.

932
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,960
It feels good?

933
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,360
Wow!

934
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,280
This is the speciality, right?

935
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,480
Right.

936
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,360
Who made this into a speciality?

937
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,640
This is no joke.

938
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,960
After the tour,
they go back to practise again.

939
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,640
They'll use "Gurenge"
for their performance.

940
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,840
This is great.

941
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,360
They gradually learned
their routine,

942
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,400
but they are too slow.

943
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,240
I can't do it.

944
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,640
We have the right vibe, though.

945
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
- It's fast.
- It is fast.

946
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,760
We're pretty much doing it.

947
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,160
It looks gorgeous.

948
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,520
This short flag is the most
demanding skill to learn

949
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,280
of all time.

950
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,760
They struggle to improve
no matter how much they practise.

951
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,360
I treat this as a mental workout.

952
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,680
As soon as I have to use both hands
or I have to alternate,

953
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,200
I'm like, "What?"

954
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,760
And my body stops.

955
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,440
In addition,
what makes it even harder is

956
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
their old age.

957
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,280
Stop that!

958
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,000
- Their average age is 38 years old.
- It's younger than I thought.

959
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,320
Asako is 50 years old already.

960
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,520
I can't leave Asako alone.

961
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,320
Isn't she something else?

962
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,280
When I go to get

963
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,800
a massage with Asako,

964
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,360
she'll be next to me...

965
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,680
Making groaning sounds.

966
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,200
She's moaning and groaning.

967
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,960
Yesterday, YuiP came to me saying,

968
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,440
"Oshima, I thought
I was going to cry."

969
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,040
When I asked her why,

970
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,280
she went,
"Asako is asking me to teach her."

971
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
She said she almost started crying.

972
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,240
When she asked me,

973
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,560
"Sorry to bother you,
but can you teach me?"

974
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,760
Asako used to be the one
to teach everyone,

975
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,800
and I was shocked
that she was asking me now.

976
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,360
- It was...
- What does it mean?

977
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,720
I mean, her expression
was something else.

978
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,760
She looked like a corpse.

979
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,200
She looked like a mud doll.

980
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,840
What is that?

981
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,000
I was shocked
that she asked me like that.

982
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,160
She's crying.

983
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,160
In addition, when they all started
to play dodge ball...

984
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,680
Watch out!

985
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,120
Murakami

986
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,440
just moved out of the way,

987
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,160
but she injured her knee
with this movement.

988
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,200
My bad!

989
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,680
Time out!

990
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,040
Murakami, what?

991
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,920
Murakami, what is it?

992
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,400
- What's the matter?
- That's not good.

993
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
You did this move right now.

994
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,720
No, it wasn't like that at all.

995
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,480
It's this slightest jump,

996
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,200
and her landing.

997
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,000
What?

998
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,760
She's done it.

999
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,040
They are all wounded,
all over their body.

1000
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,680
It's because they were playing.

1001
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,560
These middle-aged women
can't even do regular things,

1002
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,840
but they eagerly twirled the flags.

1003
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,240
You don't need touching music here.

1004
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,080
Their camp was over.

1005
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,160
Female comedians
continued their practise in Tokyo

1006
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,640
during free time.

1007
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,480
What kind of performance
will they do?

1008
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,880
They edited out
most of the practise scenes.

1009
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,560
They edited out a lot.

1010
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,280
It didn't show you practising much,

1011
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,840
but since you were all cute,
it was fine.

1012
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,160
Oh, Tetsuro!

1013
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,080
Asako, what are your goals?

1014
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,120
Yes, 12 of us haven't mastered
doing it in sync the whole time,

1015
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,680
but we will do our best to do
a cheerful New Year's performance.

1016
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,760
- Thank you!
- We're looking forward to it.

1017
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,640
Now, they will perform after this.

1018
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,760
Short flag performance
by the female comedians!

1019
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,680
Thank you!

1020
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,560
- Relax!
- Come on!

1021
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,680
Do your best! Have fun.

1022
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,360
- Let's do it!
- Okay.

1023
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,320
This is when I get most nervous.

1024
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,280
Have fun!

1025
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,720
- Do your best.
- Let's go!

1026
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,800
Excuse me, Oshima's bra came undone.

1027
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,720
Her bra came undone?

1028
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
Oh, no!

1029
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,640
Hide her with flags.

1030
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,200
- Are you okay?
- Nice teamwork!

1031
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,640
It's fine.

1032
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,920
- Is it on?
- Is it all settled?

1033
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,240
- It's okay!
- Thank you.

1034
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Let's do this.

1035
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,560
- Nice!
- Nice!

1036
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,040
- Now...
- Focus.

1037
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,320
let's start.

1038
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,320
Short flag performance

1039
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,800
by the female comedians!

1040
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,480
Amazing!

1041
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,600
That's amazing.

1042
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,080
Amazing!

1043
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,280
Amazing!

1044
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,360
That's good!

1045
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,840
Perfect score!

1046
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,560
Amazing!

1047
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,800
That was great.

1048
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,680
- Perfect!
- Amazing!

1049
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,440
Asako, how was it?

1050
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,440
It's done!

1051
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,320
Amazing!

1052
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,840
Good work!

1053
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,520
They're relieved.

1054
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,320
We have room for improvement
for sure,

1055
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,640
and since I can't look behind me,

1056
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,200
I don't know if everyone
was doing it right,

1057
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,520
but I didn't hear
any dropping sound, so I'm glad.

1058
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,000
That was incredible.

1059
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,600
Yurina, what did you think?

1060
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,280
I can relate to a formation movement
of a huge group

1061
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,800
in a performance,

1062
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,360
so I'm sure it was hard.

1063
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,200
Thank you
for such a great performance.

1064
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,960
- Thank you for watching us perform.
- Not at all.

1065
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,480
I never thought she'd be here
to watch it.

1066
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,800
When Asako stood in the front
and started her performance,

1067
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,320
it reminded me a little bit of
"Drifters, Daibakusho".

1068
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,480
Why?

1069
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,800
That's wrong!

1070
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,800
I don't look like that!

1071
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,720
Great job, everyone!
Good work, female comedians!

1072
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,240
- Good work.
- Thank you very much.
