1
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,516
The following program was produced with
the utmost consideration toward safety

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,851
and features dangerous activities which
were supervised by stunt professionals.

3
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,787
Do not attempt to reenact
any of the activities performed.

4
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:29,563
Angered by the fact that Chihara Junior
built a castle in Susono, near Mount Fuji,

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,098
Masatoshi Hamada, the pervert barbarian
from Osaka, has declared war against him.

6
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,634
Junior's Castle

7
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:39,673
Here they are, Junior's proud fleet
of eight foreign luxury battle cars.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,111
Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW,
Volvo, Alfa Romeo, Lincoln, Audi.

9
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,448
Top-class cars that symbolize the various
western countries await their opponents.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,754
As for Hamada's army,

11
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,290
they boast all Japanese battle cars.

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,559
Some of the foot soldiers have been duped

13
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,062
into competing with their own cars.
I feel sorry for them.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,765
Hamada's army versus Junior's army.

15
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,701
It's a great car battle
with everyone's lives on the line.

16
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,704
The battle will commence shortly.

17
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,441
"Sentosha Laws" - Battle 1, Battle 2,
Battle 3: Scramble over battle cars

18
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,476
The battle will consist of four rounds.

19
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,044
For the first three rounds,

20
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,814
both armies will battle to win over
the opponent's car.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,884
The winning team can select one car
from the losing team to join their army.

22
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:29,056
For the fourth and final round,
the remaining cars will battle each other.

23
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:32,126
The team with more cars left
at the start of the final round

24
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,428
will have a distinct advantage
in the battle.

25
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,031
Battle 4: Wipe out opposing army
with your remaining cars

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,001
You might die, battle number 1.

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,470
YOU MIGHT DIE
BATTLE NUMBER 1

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,171
Stop at the very last moment.

29
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,006
You might die?

30
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:46,974
You might die?

31
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:47,942
What?

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,412
All foot soldiers from both teams
will participate in this battle.

33
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,581
This is a one-on-one battle to test
who has the most courage.

34
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,250
The first team to reach five wins
will win the round.

35
00:01:56,484 --> 00:02:00,321
The losing team will need to hand over
one battle car to the winning team.

36
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:05,259
If you were wondering what's
on the other side of the wall...

37
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:11,165
We've reshaped the ground
into a steep cliff.

38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,202
Cliff at a 60-degree angle

39
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,639
The cliff goes down at a 60-degree angle.
You may die if you fall.

40
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,542
Junior's Base - Hamada's Base

41
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,777
-What?
-Are you serious? A cliff?

42
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:25,646
You just need to stop in time.

43
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,047
You say it like it's easy!

44
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,517
-It's simple!
-You just need to be courageous.

45
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,685
That's right! You just need to go for it!

46
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,921
Does stopping at the last moment mean
when you're doing it with the ring girl?

47
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:34,855
Of course not!

48
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,924
Please stop it with the dirty jokes!

49
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,995
We need your car, not your sense of humor!

50
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:41,862
Okay.

51
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,234
Two cars will start accelerating
toward the wall at the same time.

52
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,404
They must reach a speed
of 40 kilometers per hour

53
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,506
before reaching the braking zone.

54
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,778
The speed of the cars will be measured
with a speed gun.

55
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,814
The cars that fail to reach 40 kilometers
per hour will be disqualified.

56
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,683
The cars are prohibited from braking

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,419
until they reach the tape
that marks the braking zone.

58
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:06,854
The judges will check the videos carefully

59
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,557
and if any driver violates this rule,
they will be disqualified.

60
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:14,295
The driver who stops closest
to the wall wins.

61
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,765
Cowards afraid to risk their lives
could never win this battle.

62
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,266
First team to reach five wins
will win the round

63
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,603
Both armies head to the scene
of the battle for an inspection.

64
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,207
Hey, Junior.
This is the first round!

65
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,110
With this much room,
there should be no problems!

66
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,011
No problems?

67
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,080
This is the braking line, right?

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,350
That's right! You need to reach that line
before you can brake.

69
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,186
If you crash into this wall,
it's going to break apart.

70
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:39,920
I see.

71
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,723
Look where you'll end up
if you crash through the wall!

72
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,292
Oh, wow!

73
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,830
-It's like a cliff face!
-This is great!

74
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,800
-It's like a cliff.
-It's fantastic!

75
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,102
It looks dangerous.
We really might die.

76
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,005
I really don't like this cliff.

77
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,941
It's at a great angle.
It looks great!

78
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,278
First Battle

79
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,715
Here we go!

80
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,717
Who's up first from your army?

81
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,719
First one up from my team is...

82
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,621
Seiji!

83
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,856
Yeah!

84
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,759
This is the worst!

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,195
Who are you sending?

86
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,129
Who is it?

87
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,099
It's a battle of the same generation...
It's you, Fujimoto!

88
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,801
Yeah!

89
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,170
He's the biggest coward
from our generation!

90
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,238
Say what?

91
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,773
I'll smash it!

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,508
It's gonna be smashing!

93
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:35,576
A real crash?

94
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,979
You'll lose if you smash into the wall!
Why are you trying to lose?

95
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,347
Are you dumb or something?

96
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,217
It's a figure of speech! I'm going to stop
before I smash into the wall!

97
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,818
Tell him, Fujimoto!

98
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,720
It's "Ugly First" for you, isn't it?

99
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,155
Not "America First"?

100
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,891
Volvo V70
New car price approx. 7.4 million yen

101
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,593
This is Toshifumi from Junior's army.
His battle car is a Volvo V70.

102
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,762
Engine 2.5L I5 DOHC IC Turbo / 209 hp / 4WD / AT / Weight 1620kg

103
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,899
When Fujimoto was offered a part in this
show, he insisted he wouldn't accept it

104
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,969
unless he was assigned a Volvo,
well-known for its safety.

105
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,003
Toyota Celsior
New car price 8 million yen

106
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,772
Seiji Chihara from Hamada's army.

107
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,874
His battle car is a Toyota Celsior.

108
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,577
This is Toyota's executive-class car
which evolved into the Lexus brand.

109
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,413
Engine 4.3L V8 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1800kg

110
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,049
It doesn't matter.
Go and die, if necessary!

111
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,751
-All right!
-Thank you for your work!

112
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,487
-Thank you for helping us over the years!
-Thank you!

113
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,057
-Thank you for your hard work, Seiji!
-Goodbye.

114
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,659
Please show them what you can do!
Give it your all!

115
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,062
-Come on!
-He'll get through it somehow.

116
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,099
It's a one-on-one battle of courage.

117
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,169
First army to reach five wins
will win this round.

118
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,305
Make sure you reach
40 kilometers per hour, okay?

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,441
I know!

120
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,376
I'll try my best to reach
40 kilometers per hour.

121
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,845
You can't just try,
you definitely need to do it.

122
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,480
-So, 40 kilometers?
-Yeah.

123
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,251
-You can hear the fear in his voice.
-His voice is shaking.

124
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,153
Suddenly, I'm really scared.

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,055
I'm getting more and more scared.

126
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,826
Just stomp on the accelerator
until you hit 40 kilometers per hour.

127
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,462
If I stomp on it, it will hit 40 easily.

128
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,797
No, no...
Not with that little distance.

129
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,333
Seiji, don't even bother
with the seat belt.

130
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,336
Of course I'm putting on my seat belt!
I'm putting it on!

131
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,640
Don't you lose to Fujimoto.
Show us some guts.

132
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,409
I'm not going to lose, no matter what.

133
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,412
Toshifumi Fujimoto (Volvo V70)
vs Seiji Chihara (Toyota Celsior)

134
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,681
The battle between
Hamada and Junior's armies

135
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,850
is set to commence at Susono,
near Mount Fuji.

136
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,519
The first head-to-head battle
to set the scene for the rest of the war.

137
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,321
Now, here we go!

138
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,657
Fujimoto is such a coward.

139
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,193
Seiji, go and die, if necessary!

140
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,695
Come on!

141
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:35,896
Let's go!

142
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,431
Come on!

143
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,166
Who's going to win this battle?

144
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,968
Fujimoto from Junior's army
in the white battle car?

145
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,170
Or Seiji Chihara from Hamada's army
in the black?

146
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,773
Three... Two... One...

147
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,374
Go!

148
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:51,111
The first battle has started!
They both stomp on the accelerator!

149
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,080
They first need to reach
40 kilometers per hour,

150
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,915
the rest is up to their courage.

151
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,583
They're gathering more speed!

152
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,185
They're coming up to the wall!
It's very close now!

153
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,822
They brake! How did they do?
Wow, look how close Seiji is!

154
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,157
Winner, Hamada's army!

155
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,324
Seiji won!

156
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:05,893
Yeah!

157
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,028
Yeah! We won!

158
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,730
Seiji Chihara (Toyota Celsior)
45 km/h - WIN

159
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:10,964
Toshifumi Fujimoto (Volvo V70) - 46 km/h

160
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,232
Yes!

161
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,537
There is no doubt whatsoever.
It's a win for Seiji!

162
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,739
No!

163
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,708
What the hell are you doing, Fujimoto?

164
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,576
What happened?

165
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,879
Seiji's result is an amazing
80 centimeters!

166
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:27,714
SENTOSHA

167
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,284
Let's have a look at the replay.

168
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,387
At the start, even though Fujimoto
is a scaredy-cat comedian,

169
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,521
he finds his courage.

170
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,023
However, the one who had the courage
to wait

171
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,292
until the very last moment to brake
was Seiji!

172
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:42,496
Seiji, who went against his brother
to join Hamada's army,

173
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,299
has drawn first blood in this first round.

174
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,535
That was amazing!

175
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,573
Well done, Seiji!

176
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,942
You've done a great job
as the first competitor!

177
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,710
-Yeah!
-Thank you very much!

178
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,378
You went as close as 80 centimeters!

179
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,114
Our agency wants to make him
the elder brother.

180
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,018
But according to the family register,
I'm still the elder brother.

181
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,053
Of course you are.

182
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,754
You chickened out, didn't you?

183
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,323
That's not true. It's that...

184
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,825
A Volvo is a Volvo. Its brakes are great.

185
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,260
It's a four wheel drive, after all.

186
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,094
Yes.

187
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,395
You weren't going that fast anyway.

188
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,530
Volvo's are great!

189
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,232
Second Battle

190
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,769
Hey, Junior.
How do you feel about losing to us?

191
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,570
What?

192
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:27,674
Do you wanna keep going?
Why don't you just give up?

193
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,943
We'll...

194
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,912
Has Fujimoto gone home already?

195
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,914
I'm still here!

196
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,215
Dumb-ass!

197
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,786
Next up is Akina!

198
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,520
Yay!

199
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,023
-Let's go!
-It's Akina!

200
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,224
I'll try my best!

201
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,560
Then we'll send Nagisa!

202
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,461
Yes!

203
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,333
Nagisa's brought her own car.
She's got a lot on the line!

204
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,036
What? She brought her own car?

205
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,004
Why?

206
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,273
I'll make sure there are lots of dents
in it by the end of the day!

207
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,441
Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Kompressor
New car price approx. 4.8 million yen

208
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,777
Next up for Junior's army is
Akina Minami.

209
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,178
Her battle car is
a Mercedes-Benz SLK Kompressor.

210
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,781
Engine 2.3L I4 DOHC Super Charger / 197 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1380 kg

211
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,350
It's a two-seater sports car

212
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,320
that has a 2.3-liter DOHC engine
with a supercharger.

213
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,621
Nissan Fuga
New car price approx. 5.7 million yen

214
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,591
For Hamada's army, we have Nagisa
from Amako Inter.

215
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,293
Her battle car is a Nissan Fuga.

216
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,895
It is classified as an executive car,

217
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,464
but this model is a GT car
with a 3.5-liter DOHC engine.

218
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,767
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 Horsepower / FR / AT / weight 1680kg

219
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,670
This battle car was forcibly
made to join Hamada's army

220
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:34,541
after Nagisa was fooled into
buying a car for a fake TV program.

221
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,742
It's a good car.

222
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:36,843
It's a nice car.
She just bought it, right?

223
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,946
She washed it as well.

224
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,181
Oh, no way. No way, no way.

225
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,249
She's laughing.

226
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,450
She must be happy to see you.

227
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,618
She's got a leopard print cover
on the steering wheel.

228
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,254
You've been duped, Nagisa. Dumb-ass.

229
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,221
Dumb-ass.

230
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,957
Do you want me to smack you?

231
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,696
This is Nagisa's first ever car.

232
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,231
-It's classified as an executive car.
-Wow.

233
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,400
How did you feel on your first drive?

234
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,301
Amazing.

235
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,670
I've never been so happy.

236
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,771
-Seriously?
-Yes.

237
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:05,672
She has only paid the deposit
of 100,000 yen

238
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,475
The loan on the car
has not been paid off at all.

239
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,212
She just bought it!

240
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,714
I feel so sorry for her.

241
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,483
-I feel sorry for her.
-We all feel sorry for her!

242
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,086
Hamada's army is so devious!

243
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,421
I'm so excited!

244
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,155
What?

245
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,157
I hope you fall down that cliff.

246
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,194
Why don't you drive through that wall
and down that cliff!

247
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,429
You don't know the meaning of having guts!

248
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,265
I've got guts, too.
You shouldn't underestimate me.

249
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,202
I'll show you.

250
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,303
Show me, then.

251
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,274
Two ladies will battle it out
in the second match.

252
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:45,612
The white battle car is the Nissan Fuga
that Nagisa is paying off.

253
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,882
Nagisa from Amako Inter joined
Hamada's army against her will.

254
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,550
The compact red Mercedes

255
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,787
will be driven by Akina
from Junior's army.

256
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,124
I'm getting nervous
now that I'm in the car.

257
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,659
I hear that Akina doesn't get nervous
in the car at all.

258
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,763
-Really?
-She's really quick in a go-kart.

259
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,164
She races go-karts? Really?

260
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,866
I'm so scared...

261
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,770
Go hard, Nagisa.

262
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,305
I can't go hard
or I'll go through the wall!

263
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,341
Try to stop just before the wall.

264
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:15,876
Yes, I'll do my best.

265
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:16,943
Go for it.

266
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,179
Akina Minami
(Mercedes-Benz SLK Kompressor)

267
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,715
vs Nagisa from Amako Inter (Nissan Fuga)

268
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:25,218
Akina becomes a speed demon
when she's behind a steering wheel.

269
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,319
Now she's smiling!

270
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,156
But Nagisa, is she okay?
She's not herself.

271
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,291
She must be worried about her car.

272
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,593
What is with that steering wheel?

273
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,396
The steering wheel's
got leopard print covers!

274
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,931
Don't mention it!

275
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,969
This is Nagisa's beloved car.
How gutsy can she be?

276
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,172
How hard can she stomp on the accelerator?

277
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,606
Three... Two...

278
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,607
One...

279
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,309
Go!

280
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,211
Here they go!

281
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,814
What's happening with Akina?
She runs straight into Nagisa!

282
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,084
Was that intentional?
She's being tricky right from the outset!

283
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,186
But this is a braking battle.

284
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,054
They need to reach
40 kilometers per hour first,

285
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,489
then hit the brakes!
Now, who won the battle?

286
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,824
Akina is well short!

287
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,624
Nagisa from Amako Inter (Nissan Fuga)
42 km/h - 4m 40cm - WIN

288
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,625
Wow, this is a surprise!
Nagisa is the winner.

289
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,294
The winner is Hamada's army!

290
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,428
Yeah!

291
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,730
Akina Minami (Mercedes-Benz
SLK 230 Kompressor) - 6m 10cm

292
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,432
What just happened?

293
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,834
A win is a win!

294
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,402
Akina, did you bump into her?

295
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,770
She totally bumped her.

296
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,705
Two wins in a row for Hamada's army!

297
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:19,940
Nagisa is the winner.

298
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,943
I won, so it's all good!

299
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,044
Oh, no!

300
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:25,912
It's all good!

301
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,815
But what is the damage to the Fuga?

302
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,219
She was rear-ended by Akina.
How does it look?

303
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,186
SENTOSHA

304
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,388
Here's the replay.

305
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,326
Akina intentionally drove
into Nagisa from the start.

306
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,560
Go!

307
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,195
Here we go again.

308
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,099
This is clear as day.
Akina has definitely steered into Nagisa.

309
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,069
She's clearly turning the steering wheel.

310
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,005
She's smiling!

311
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,008
What happened here?

312
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,511
Did we touch? Really?

313
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,613
You crashed into me!

314
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,616
Are you kidding me? What's wrong with you?

315
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,985
What were you thinking?

316
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,720
Did they crash into each other?

317
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,088
They bumped into each other.

318
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,491
I bumped into you? I'm so sorry!

319
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,260
Why, you little...

320
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm sorry...

321
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,162
Are you for real?

322
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,531
My front bumped into you a little...

323
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:22,002
Come here! No way!

324
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,403
No!

325
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,606
What's so funny?

326
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,074
Hey!

327
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,478
Stop laughing!

328
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,579
This is so much fun!

329
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,347
Shit!

330
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,782
Run, run, run!

331
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,386
She crashed into me!

332
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,422
She crashed into me!

333
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,525
She crashed into my car!

334
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,562
I was so busy trying to crash into her

335
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,530
that I totally forgot to check
the speedometer.

336
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,399
I wonder where you bumped into
each other?

337
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,702
I don't know, but I think she bumped
me in the back at the start.

338
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,905
When I was driving,
I felt a bit of a bump like this.

339
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,208
-That was it, then.
-I think so.

340
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,777
Is that what it feels like?

341
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,945
Didn't you notice it?

342
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,281
I'm not sure
but when I was accelerating straight,

343
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,049
the steering went like this for a moment.

344
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,951
-That's it.
-That's when it happened.

345
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,851
That must be it.

346
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,286
So it happened right at the start.

347
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,422
Third Battle

348
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,059
Have you given up already?

349
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,928
You're not competitive at all!

350
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,231
That was a bit of an accident.

351
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,466
We just wanted to get the Fuga...

352
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:31,438
You come over here! I'll show you!

353
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,673
I'll get you!

354
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,874
No way!

355
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,409
No way!

356
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,911
No way!

357
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:38,745
No way!

358
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,613
Shit!

359
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,048
No way, your steering wheel
is leopard print.

360
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,484
It looks cool!

361
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,519
We're going for it now!

362
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,721
It's your turn, Matsuoka!

363
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,422
Yes!

364
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,590
Go for it!

365
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,494
For us, we have...

366
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,663
Katsumata!

367
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,632
Yeah!

368
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:05,238
I'll beat you to a pulp, Matsuoka!
I hear that you like cars!

369
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,439
I do love cars.

370
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,642
Then it will look bad if you lose, huh?

371
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,178
I'll never lose to you. Never.

372
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:13,947
Nissan Fairlady Z
New car price 3.5 million yen

373
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,716
The man who wears shorts all year round,
Kunikazu Katsumata.

374
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,151
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1440kg

375
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,919
His battle car is a Japanese-made
sports car,

376
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,454
the Nissan Fairlady Z.

377
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:22,989
Jaguar XJ Executive
New car price approx. 8.1 million yen

378
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,458
The Rock 'n' Rolling speedster,
Mitsuru Matsuoka.

379
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,028
His battle car is the highest-class car
from Britain, the Jaguar XJ Executive.

380
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,231
Engine 4.0L V8 DOHC / 243 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1730kg

381
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,267
-The record is Seiji's 80 centimeters.
-Okay.

382
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,803
Let's do better than that in this race.

383
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,338
How about 15 centimeters?

384
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,539
I'll aim for 8.

385
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,842
I'll stop just before the wall!

386
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,778
Katsumata's trying to rev him up.

387
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:45,512
Yeah, he is.

388
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,848
It's a bit obvious, though.

389
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,550
He's trying to get him to crash
through to the other side.

390
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,753
He's trying to drive him off the cliff!

391
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,624
Looks like you really need to step on it.

392
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,061
No problem.
I'll stop really close to the wall.

393
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,198
I've really tried to egg him on a bit.

394
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,368
So I think he'll crash through
to the other side of the wall.

395
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,503
-Okay.
-So I'll go safety first.

396
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,040
You're revealing your plan?

397
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,343
After all that talk,
you're going safety first?

398
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,377
Safety first!

399
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,511
Mitsuru Matsuoka (Jaguar XJ Executive)
vs Kunikazu Katsumata (Nissan Fairlady Z)

400
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,081
Is Hamada going to take Junior's castle
right here, now?

401
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,751
So far, it's been two wins in a row for
Hamada, the Speedy Barbarian from Osaka.

402
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,787
Now, competing in the third round
are two silver battle cars.

403
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,222
Driving the Jaguar

404
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,491
is the Rock 'n' Rolling speedster
from Junior's army, Mitsuru Matsuoka.

405
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,926
And driving the Fairlady Z
for Hamada's army

406
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,829
is the man who wears shorts
all year round, Katsumata.

407
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,198
Come on!

408
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,233
My God, Katsumata's really fired up!

409
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,370
Let's go!

410
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,339
Go for it! Pedal to the metal!

411
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,475
By contrast, Matsuoka is very quiet.

412
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,578
Three... Two... One...

413
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,613
Go!

414
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,049
Now, Katsumata's really going for it,
full throttle.

415
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,152
The Fairlady Z is in front!
He is accelerating very fast!

416
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,553
Maybe he's going too fast?

417
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,555
They're up to the braking line.
They're stopping...

418
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,391
Matsuoka's doing well... No!

419
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,026
No, he's falling through
to the other side. Look out!

420
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,328
Matsuoka's doing well...

421
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:11,030
No, he's falling through
to the other side. Look out!

422
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,632
No, he fell down the cliff!

423
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,300
There's an explosion as well. Is he okay?

424
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,268
Kunikazu Katsumata (Nissan Fairlady Z)
45 km/h - 5m 30cm - WIN

425
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,102
Mitsuru Matsuoka (Jaguar XJ Executive)
49 km/h - DQ

426
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,171
No way! Shit!

427
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,775
Hamada's army wins!

428
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:22,609
Yes!

429
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,377
Yes!

430
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,779
Just as planned!

431
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,781
Just as planned!

432
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,084
Matsuoka! What happened?

433
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,152
He got overexcited.

434
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,720
I couldn't stop.

435
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,022
SENTOSHA

436
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,893
Who could have predicted Hamada would win
three in a row?

437
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,028
Let's have a look at Matsuoka's braking.

438
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,131
He brakes right here.
But it was all too late!

439
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,833
For the first time,
someone has gone through the wall

440
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,768
and fallen through to the other side.

441
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:53,773
This means Matsuoka is disqualified.
The winner is Katsumata.

442
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,142
They're playing it really safe!

443
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,178
-True.
-He chickened out.

444
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,245
What was that?

445
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,382
He stopped before the wall.
No problem at all.

446
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,784
He stopped well short of the wall. There!

447
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,252
Well short!

448
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,855
That's terrible. Is he even a man?

449
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,757
That's terrible.

450
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,058
Totally.

451
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,562
It went according to plan.
He got so annoyed at me.

452
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,698
He was so annoyed that he stepped
on the accelerator too much.

453
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,266
-Wow.
-He was behind you...

454
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,202
-Yes.
-So he was trying to catch up.

455
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,503
He was easy to fool.

456
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,206
You're so clever.

457
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,675
I got so fired up...

458
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,544
I thought I'd beat him up.

459
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,880
Fourth Battle

460
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:38,151
Hey, Junior's army!

461
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,052
What?

462
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,653
We are sending...

463
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,257
Juichi Wakisaka!

464
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,292
Then we'll counter with...

465
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,229
The other Wakisaka!

466
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:50,797
I'll beat you.

467
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:51,531
Tell him!

468
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,200
When people think of a race car driver
with the name Wakisaka, they think of me!

469
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,268
That's right!

470
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,704
This battle has nothing
to do with our past!

471
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,571
Yeah!

472
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,340
BMW 330i
New car price approx. 5.7 million yen

473
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,876
From Junior's army,
this is Shigekazu Wakisaka.

474
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:06,012
Although Shigekazu is less well-known
compared to his brother,

475
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,649
he's still one of Japan's top racers
competing in the Super GT class.

476
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,418
His battle car is the legendary car
from Germany, the BMW 330i.

477
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,421
Engine 3L I6 DOHC / 231 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1520kg

478
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,091
For Hamada's army,
we have Juichi Wakisaka.

479
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,493
His battle car is the Nissan Skyline.

480
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,330
In his 16 years of racing,
Wakisaka has only ever driven Toyotas.

481
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,399
Here, he has entered the competition
in a car from rival manufacturer, Nissan.

482
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,102
Modified to suit hooligans from Chiba
and Ibaraki,

483
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,105
it features giant over fenders
and a bamboo-spear muffler.

484
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,840
What does its exhaust sound like?

485
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,441
New car price 3.1 million yen
Engine 2.5L I6 DOHC / 200 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1400kg

486
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,412
If this weren't Mr. Hamada's program,
I'd never ever drive a Nissan.

487
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,449
Let me say that Toyota's CEO
will be watching this show

488
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,851
as I'll be driving in it.

489
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,519
The older brother Juichi
is known as Mr. GT,

490
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,755
and has been one of the best
race car drivers Japan has ever produced.

491
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,590
Currently, Juichi also manages
a Super GT race team.

492
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,126
Shigekazu Wakisaka (BMW 330i)
vs Juichi Wakisaka (Nissan Skyline)

493
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,596
His brother Shigekazu
is also a current race car driver.

494
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,899
Who will win this high level battle
between these two brothers?

495
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,668
Juichi's car sports a bamboo spear

496
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,103
reminiscent of the gangs
from Chiba and Ibaraki.

497
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,438
As a professional racer,

498
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,474
Shigekazu has always been called
Juichi's little brother.

499
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,277
Can Shigekazu beat his brother here?

500
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,212
How's the car?

501
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,181
As you can see...

502
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,418
The other car has bamboo spears
sticking out from the back.

503
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:22,055
If I lose to that...

504
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,090
-It'd be very embarrassing.
-Yep.

505
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,459
-It's a hooligan's car.
-Let's go, Juichi!

506
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,061
I'll do my best.

507
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:33,600
But Mr. Hamada, the view from here
is quite frightening.

508
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,334
The view?

509
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:38,104
The view from here is completely different
to what you see from up there.

510
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,773
It's quite scary.
But, no matter. I'll do my best.

511
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,042
You can't be beaten
by your little brother.

512
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,445
-I know. I'll do it for you, Mr. Hamada.
-Okay.

513
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:49,215
Can Shigekazu overcome his brother?
The battle is about to begin.

514
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,351
It's a battle between family members.

515
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,454
Listen to the exhaust!
Listen to the engine noise reverberate

516
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,855
in Susono near Mount Fuji.

517
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,492
Will it be the elder brother, Juichi?

518
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,427
Or the little brother, Shigekazu?

519
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:02,862
Three...

520
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,030
Two...

521
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:04,864
Please, we need to win this one!

522
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,632
One...

523
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:06,299
Come on!

524
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,433
Go!

525
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,703
Here we go! Look at Shigekazu accelerate!
Juichi has started very, very slowly!

526
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,306
If he doesn't reach 40 kilometers
per hour, he'll be disqualified!

527
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,208
Shigekazu has reached the speed
required, but how's his braking?

528
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,376
It seems Juichi has chickened out,

529
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,510
if he doesn't speed up,
he'll be disqualified.

530
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,312
Shigekazu has done an amazing job!
He stopped at one meter!

531
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,947
The winner is Junior's army.

532
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,116
This battle between two brothers has been
won by the younger brother, Shigekazu!

533
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:23,883
Juichi Wakisaka (Nissan Skyline)
35 km/h - DQ

534
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,651
Shigekazu Wakisaka (BMW 330i)
43 km/h - 1m - WIN

535
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,285
-Yes!
-That was bad...

536
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,186
What happened to Juichi?
Did he get scared?

537
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,155
He only reached 35 kilometers per hour.

538
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,757
Shigekazu has won very easily!

539
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,926
What the hell happened?

540
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,094
What happened?

541
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,163
-Shit!
-Shit.

542
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,298
-What was that?
-He was terrible.

543
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,133
SENTOSHA

544
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:44,303
Here's the replay.
The battle of the brothers.

545
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,572
Let's see where they both hit the brakes.

546
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,408
When did the tail lights light up?

547
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,910
Shigekazu hasn't braked yet.

548
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,278
He brakes right here!

549
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,514
How about Juichi?
He's already braking here!

550
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,449
Not only has Juichi failed to reach
the minimum speed required,

551
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,818
he also hit the brake
before the braking line.

552
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,287
This must be embarrassing
for the older brother.

553
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,922
He has clearly chickened out.

554
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,325
-He clearly chickened out.
-This is disappointing.

555
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,528
-He chickened out.
-He totally chickened out.

556
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,329
What the hell were you doing?

557
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,499
I'm sorry, I got really scared.

558
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,701
You're kidding!

559
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,669
He's supposed to be a pro!

560
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:17,470
So uncool.

561
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,773
The engine noise was also
really loud, so... It was really scary.

562
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,309
What do you mean, you were scared?

563
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,478
I'm sorry, I was scared.

564
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,381
That's your day job!

565
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,919
It's so embarrassing to brake so early
in a mod car!

566
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,154
So true! It's an epic fail.

567
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,256
Wow, look at the distance we won by!

568
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,194
Well done!

569
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,030
I ended up winning somehow.

570
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,599
Nice job!

571
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,436
How can you show your face after that?

572
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,472
You try doing it. It's really scary!

573
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,406
I did it!

574
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,941
Everyone did it. Even women!

575
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,209
We all did it.

576
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,045
They don't understand.

577
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,647
What do you mean?
We did the same thing you did!

578
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,484
We're all in the same team!
It's all for Hamada's army!

579
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,518
WIN Seiji Chihara vs Toshifumi Fujimoto
WIN Nagisa from Amako Inter vs Akina Minami

580
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,385
WIN Kunikazu Katsumata vs Mitsuru Matsuoka
Juichi Wakisaka vs Shigekazu Wakisaka WIN

581
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,421
In the fourth match,
Junior's army finally get their first win.

582
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:12,658
Now, on to the second half
of this round-one battle.

583
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,027
Fifth Battle

584
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,332
Next, we're sending Shoji!

585
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,399
Yeah, let's go!

586
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,635
And we're sending...

587
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,005
It's me! Iwahashi!

588
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,740
You're losing your voice already.

589
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,142
He's fired up!

590
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,544
I screamed too much when I found out that

591
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,447
I had to use my own car for this.
Now my voice is gone.

592
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:35,381
Honda Crossroad
New car price 2.9 million yen

593
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,884

is Yoshimasa Iwahashi.

594
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,920

596
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:43,990
What?

597
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:46,359
What's going on?

598
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,594
Iwahashi was lured over to Susono
near Mount Fuji

599
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,897
to film a TV segment
that didn't even exist.

600
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,366
Iwahashi was also forcibly made to provide
his own car as one of the battle cars.

601
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,501
Come on over here.

602
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,603
The muffler... What?

603
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,873
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

604
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,476
Shut up.

605
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,611
I don't know what's going on!

606
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,714
-Everyone, come over here.
-I still don't know what's going on.

607
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,448
Okay.

608
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,383
Alfa Romeo Alfa GT
New car price approx. 5.4 million yen

609
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,385
For Junior's army, Tomoharu Shoji.

610
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,188
His battle car is the Alfa Romeo Alfa GT.

611
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,291
It's an Italian sports car
with a two-liter DOHC engine.

612
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:21,527
Engine 2L I4 DOHC / 166 hp / FF / Semi Automatic / Weight 1480kg

613
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,664
I really love that car.

614
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,702
Shit.

615
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,406
It's my family car...

616
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,909
You can't drive into the wall, okay?

617
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,912
Can you stop saying that?

618
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,115
Don't do it, okay?

619
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,083
Stop it, will you?

620
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,752
Who's saying you can't crash
into the wall? Stop it?

621
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:49,088
Don't fall down the cliff, okay?

622
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,523
No, don't do that!

623
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,392
No, he can't say that!

624
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,027
Don't say that!

625
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:00,666
Iwahashi, make sure not to fall down
the hill, okay?

626
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,001
Please don't say that!

627
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,470
-Don't drive into the wall.
-I know that!

628
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,438
No, no, no!

629
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,707
Don't crash into the wall
with your own car.

630
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,742
It's really my car!

631
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:13,279
I worked so hard to buy this car!

632
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,948
Tomoharu Shoji (Alfa Romeo GT)
vs Yoshimasa Iwahashi (Honda Crossroad)

633
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,751
Iwahashi, who was deceived by the tyrant,

634
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:22,989
has been forced to participate
in this battle with his own car.

635
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,292
It's your own car. Do your best, okay?

636
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,026
Yes!

637
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,262
Bad luck for Iwahashi -
The camera that films his face is broken

638
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,596
I'm fine, but...

639
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,965
Can you stop them
from scaring me by saying

640
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,601
"Don't crash into the wall"
and things like that?

641
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:37,637
Hemingway.

642
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,572
You're saying random things again.

643
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,473
Ocean view.

644
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:41,607
Stop it!

645
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:42,508
Sorry.

646
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,510
Soy, soy, soy!

647
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,812
-What are you saying now?
-Soy beans.

648
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,650
Are you good to go?

649
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,752
Yes, I'm good. I'm up against Iwahashi,

650
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,421
so I think he's going to crash
like he usually does.

651
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,491
No problem at all.

652
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,862
For Junior's army,
we have the red Alfa Romeo

653
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,831
driven by the man
who often screams his wife's name, Shoji.

654
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,101
Will Iwahashi be able to deliver
his family car back home

655
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,038
without a scratch,
and also bring victory for Hamada?

656
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:17,176
Or will scream his wife's name in victory?

657
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:21,213
Three... Two... One...
Go!

658
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,451
There they go! Looks like a steady start.
No, they're both speeding up very quickly!

659
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:28,054
Iwahashi is in front!
Where will he hit the brakes?

660
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,021
He brakes here!

661
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,823
Can he stop? No, he can't stop!

662
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,893
Have a look on the far side.
Shoji's driven straight through!

663
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,963
Have a look on the far side.
Shoji's driven straight through!

664
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,166
Have a look on the far side.
Shoji's driven straight through!

665
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,369
He's driven straight through the wall
and went down the cliff!

666
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,770
Is Shoji okay?

667
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:45,671
What happened?

668
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,273
He just couldn't stop in time.

669
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,009
He managed to stop just before
falling down the cliff.

670
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,477
He did quite well.

671
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:52,411
He came so close!

672
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,847
-He showed a lot of courage.
-That's true.

673
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,717
He would've won
had there not been any wall.

674
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,186
Shoji, what were you doing?

675
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,420
Hey, Shoji!

676
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,423
That was really scary.

677
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,491
Yoshimasa Iwahashi (Nissan Crossroad)
45 km/h - DQ

678
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:06,492
Tomoharu Shoji (Alfa Romeo Alfa GT)
42 km/h - DQ

679
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:10,629
The Crossroad's crashed into the wall.
Has it sustained any damage?

680
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,099
I couldn't get enough speed at first.

681
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,433
It looks fine.

682
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,570
It looks okay!

683
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,271
Wow, there's a massive scratch
on the car!

684
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,172
No, there isn't!

685
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,942
-There's a big scratch there!
-That was already there!

686
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,710
It's not a scratch!

687
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,812
Wait a minute. Is it really okay?

688
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:37,890
SENTOSHA

689
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:39,892
Go!

690
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,560
For a guy worried about his car,

691
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,863
Iwahashi really stomped on
the accelerator.

692
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,098
He's going pretty fast,
then he brakes here!

693
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,702
The surprise is on the far side.

694
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,539
Did he actually hit the brakes?
Here's the view from his on-board camera.

695
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,775
The car that we can see to the side
is Iwahashi's car.

696
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,777
Was he too busy looking at Iwahashi?

697
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,546
He brakes way too late
and crashes through the wall.

698
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,248
Shoji goes down the cliff.

699
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,885
This means Junior's army cannot lose
any of the remaining matches!

700
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,454
Sixth Battle

701
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,856
The next driver is...

702
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,993
-Let's go, Itakura!
-Yes, sir.

703
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,961
They've got Itakura?

704
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,464
We're sending Sata!

705
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,033
-Go!
-Yeah!

706
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,169
-Who's this?
-Let's go!

707
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,839
You think raising your voice
like that is enough?

708
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,808
-Yeah!
-That's so old-fashioned.

709
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,443
You wanna fight me, do you?

710
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,746
I'll stop within 50 centimeters
of the wall!

711
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,316
How about you?

712
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,452
I'll make it 2 centimeters!

713
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:42,688
Nissan Laurel 2000SGX
New car price 1.03 million yen

714
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,723
For Hamada's army,
we have Masaki Sata.

715
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,359
He's participating in his beloved
Nissan Laurel,

716
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,295
first manufactured back in 1972.

717
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,664
It's a legendary car highly sought after
by vintage car enthusiasts.

718
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,265
Engine 2L I6 SOHC / 30 hp / FR / 5MT / Weight 1200kg

719
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,067
This car is 41 years old.

720
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,770
It was released in 1976.

721
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,706
I'd say there's only about
30 of these cars left in Japan.

722
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:05,077
If I take it to a dealer,
they'll offer me 7 million yen.

723
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,213
-Seriously?
-That's what kind of car this is.

724
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,647
Basic design is the same as Skyline,
can reach a maximum speed of 175 km/h.

725
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:09,949
But I brought this car today,

726
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,017
under strict orders from our agency.

727
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,086
"Mr. Hamada wants your car," they said.

728
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:16,589
Mercedes-Benz S320
New car price approx. 10 million yen

729
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:19,225
As for Junior's army,
we have Toshiyuki Itakura.

730
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,962
His battle car is a Mercedes-Benz S320.

731
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:28,934
The S class is Mercedes' flagship model,
a luxury car that anyone dreams of owning.

732
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,504
Engine 3.2L V6 SOHC / 224 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1800kg

733
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,341
If I win, it means your team has lost!

734
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,275
What?

735
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:37,977
You said you'll aim for 2 centimeters.

736
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,445
-Remember?
-I'll get 2 centimeters!

737
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,780
Can we say you'll lose
if you don't make 2 centimeters?

738
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,716
What do you mean?

739
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,451
You're the one who said it!

740
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,119
Can I say 2 millimeters instead?

741
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,021
Those aren't the rules!

742
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,957
The rule is you don't hit the wall.

743
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,727
No, it's like a promise between men.

744
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,795
What do you mean, a promise between men?

745
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:59,431
I wonder if he's also going to
go defensive?

746
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,366
I think so, too.

747
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,935
He was saying there were no more
parts available to repair the car.

748
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:03,969
He looks nervous.

749
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,672
How are you feeling, Itakura?

750
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:10,009
It's looking good. I think I can win.

751
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:15,381
It is your car.
How are you going to act under pressure?

752
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:21,320
Mr. Hamada, I can get quite stupid
at times like these and go all out.

753
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:22,688
Really?

754
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,591
Toshiyuki Itakura (Mercedes-Benz S320)
vs Masaki Sata (Nissan Laurel 2000SGX)

755
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,426
Junior's army,
with their backs against the wall,

756
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,030
has sent Itakura from the comedy group
Impulse in this silver Mercedes.

757
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,966
Up against him is Sata
from the comedy group Bad Boys,

758
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,868
who used to be the head of a gang
that dominated the Kyushu area.

759
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,304
Sata is competing in his beloved
Nissan Laurel!

760
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,306
Could you...

761
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,541
Sata looks cool, calm and collected.

762
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,810
It's a bit tight, yes.

763
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,347
Itakura is having some issues. Is he okay?

764
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,750
Itakura in his Mercedes cannot
afford to lose this match.

765
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,118
Three... Two...

766
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,820
Sata is relaxed enough to smile!

767
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,021
One...

768
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,156
Go!

769
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,359
Here we go again.
Itakura is gaining a lot of speed here.

770
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,962
On the other hand,
Sata's not accelerating at all.

771
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,064
He already hit the brakes
before the braking zone!

772
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,666
Sata is disqualified.
How about Itakura? He stopped!

773
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,568
He did very well!
His result is 1 meter 25 centimeters!

774
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,003
Winner is Junior's army!

775
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,172
Masaki Sata (Nissan Laurel) - 35 km/h - DQ

776
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,774
Toshiyuki Itakura (Mercedes-Benz S320)
42 km/h, 1m 25cm, WIN

777
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,810
-God, he sucked!
-He chickened out!

778
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,744
Yes!

779
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,614
And whatever happened to Sata?
Where is he?

780
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,515
What happened to Sata?

781
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:24,883
What?

782
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,986
What?

783
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,225
Wow, who would have thought?

784
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,095
What happened with the former gang leader!

785
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,331
He chickened out!

786
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,666
Such a terrible attempt!

787
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,101
I know how he feels...

788
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,737
He got scared
because he's driving his own car.

789
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,071
That's so embarrassing.

790
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,673
So uncool.

791
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,774
That was terrible.

792
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:54,213
Sata is the second driver apart
from Juichi Wakisaka to be disqualified

793
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,947
by breaching both the minimum speed limit
and the braking zone rule.

794
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:55,848
He can't deny he chickened out.

795
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:56,715
SENTOSHA

796
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,218
Let's have a look at the replay.

797
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,753
Go!

798
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:04,256
Here, Sata's being very, very careful.
Too careful!

799
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,226
His beloved Laurel is said to be
worth 7 million yen.

800
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:10,229
He needs to take good care of it.
He brakes way too early!

801
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:13,932
A loss for Hamada's army means
they are at three wins and two losses.

802
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,734
Junior's army is catching up.

803
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,405
Here's Sata. He's not competing at all!

804
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,939
He's already braking here.

805
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:25,944
He must love his Laurel a lot.
What a disappointing performance.

806
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,447
What was that?

807
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,816
What was that?
That really sucked.

808
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:32,318
-That was really bad.
-Yes.

809
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,619
You lost by 10 m.

810
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,858
My car is like a wife to me.

811
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,995
You can't let your wife

812
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,332
sleep with some guy you don't know!

813
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,866
What are you talking about?

814
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,868
-It's not your wife.
-It's your car!

815
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,537
-It's like my wife!
-It's a car!

816
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,572
-She's my wife!
-It's a car!

817
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,940
You don't understand!

818
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,141
You guys can fix it when it gets damaged.

819
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,110
You can buy the same car if you want!

820
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,512
You should go buy the latest car
on the market!

821
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:04,650
There'll be lots of parts for those cars.

822
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:07,553
So true! Just buy a car
that you can easily buy parts for!

823
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,421
You didn't even bring your own car!

824
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,926
For Junior's army to win this round,

825
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,362
they must win both
of the remaining battles.

826
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,564
Seventh Battle

827
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,334
For this battle, I'm sending...

828
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,803
Keiji Muto!

829
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,704
Yeah!

830
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,273
Yeah!

831
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,875
In that case, we're sending...

832
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,077
The man with a face that could kill!

833
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,314
Face that could kill. What?

834
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,550
-Hey, Muto!
-Yes!

835
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,954
We're adults,
let's aim for 80 kilometers per hour.

836
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,957
What? Why?

837
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:45,891
He said 80 kilometers per hour.

838
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,527
If we win the next battle,
we win this round.

839
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,261
What?

840
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,963
We're going to win!

841
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,297
We're not going to lose!

842
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:53,165
Lincoln Navigator
New car price 10 million yen

843
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,401
Next man up for Junior's army
is Keiji Muto.

844
00:33:55,467 --> 00:34:00,205
His battle car is an American car, popular
with VIPs, the Lincoln Navigator.

845
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,941
One of its strengths is that a 5.4-liter
engine pulls a 2.5-ton monster.

846
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,978
Engine 5.4L V8DOHC / 304 hp / AWD / AT / 2500kg

847
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,113
Your cars are just like pieces of paper!

848
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,482
The unbeatable Pro Wrestling Master,
Keiji Muto

849
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,885
I'll smash all of them to bits! Yeah!

850
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:14,686
Toyota Century
New car price 12 million yen

851
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,855
For Hamada's army,
we have Hitoshi Ozawa.

852
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,358
His battle car is the pinnacle
of Japanese cars,

853
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:21,360
the legendary Toyota Century.

854
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,795
Engine 5L V12 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 2000kg

855
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,297
Ozawa, the man with a face
that could kill, will be driving the car

856
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,699
favored by government officials
and company executives.

857
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,102
The man with a face that could kill,
Hitoshi Ozawa

858
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,405
I'm famous for my audacious attack
and pulverizing my opponents.

859
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,607
You better be ready for an all out attack.

860
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,011
I feel like Mr. Ozawa's
not gonna brake at all.

861
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,447
We'll just see him disappear
down the hill.

862
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,151
We're already up to the seventh match
in this round.

863
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:49,354
Here's something troubling...
An urgent update.

864
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,657
Ozawa from Hamada's army has brought along

865
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,227
a multitude of weapons and destructive
materials onto the battlefield.

866
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,796
Here's Muto.

867
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,601
And where's... Here's Ozawa.

868
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:05,137
What is he up to?

869
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,872
He's walking toward Junior.

870
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,673
Hey, Junior.

871
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,640
He wants to talk to
the other army's warlord.

872
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,576
Why are you sitting on your high horse?

873
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,011
He's coming!
The man with a face that could kill!

874
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:13,912
Here you go!

875
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:17,149
What's this?

876
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,851
What's this?

877
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,790
What's this?
It's an audacious attack!

878
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,092
-It's my gift to you.
-Was that a grenade?

879
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,327
Is he nuts?

880
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,428
He's so dangerous!

881
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:32,130
-It's a gift!
-He's laughing!

882
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,667
It would have been really dangerous
if that exploded just a little later.

883
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,903
-He threw a grenade.
-A grenade!

884
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,104
That's dangerous!

885
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,806
That man is really dangerous.

886
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,575
Has Muto realized
what his opponent has done?

887
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,310
I smell danger already.

888
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,012
It exploded at a good moment.

889
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,383
He looks rather satisfied.

890
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,785
Even we can't control him!

891
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,255
The battle is about to commence.

892
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,358
I wonder if Muto has realized
what just occurred?

893
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,927
He is being taken to his car
in the back of a utility truck.

894
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,796
Muto's knee is like a bomb
that's about to explode.

895
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,500
That was a rather serene image.

896
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,272
Mr. Ozawa, you don't happen
to be hiding a dead body in the trunk?

897
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,876
I can't be sure that there isn't...

898
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,448
I remember once I packed napalm
in the back of a jeep

899
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,350
and drove straight down a cliff.

900
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,054
-This is bad.
-You'll be fine.

901
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,390
-It's hard!
-You can do it!

902
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:32,758
I'll try my best.

903
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,260
If you lose,
it means we've lost this round.

904
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,696
-I know. I'll push it as much as possible.
-Good.

905
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:39,898
Now, here is Ozawa.

906
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,768
I wonder what he's going to do
in the race.

907
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,503
Keiji Muto (Lincoln Navigator)
vs Hitoshi Ozawa (Toyota Century)

908
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,941
There's a sense of danger and a scent
of gunpowder in this battle.

909
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,009
Muto...

910
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,045
Versus...

911
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:54,680
Ozawa.

912
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,547
Three...

913
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,250
Two... One...

914
00:36:58,917 --> 00:36:59,918
Go!

915
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:01,687
Here they go.

916
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,856
They've both intentionally
driven into each other!

917
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:06,925
Jostling for position.

918
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,394
Ozawa in the Century
and Muto in the Navigator!

919
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,930
Now, they just need to hit the brakes!
They both need to stop before the wall!

920
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,932
Muto's stopped.
Ozawa crashed into the wall!

921
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,934
Muto's stopped.
Ozawa crashed into the wall!

922
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,936
Muto's stopped.
Ozawa crashed into the wall!

923
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,504
Did he even touch the brakes?

924
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,040
Looks like crashed into it
without braking at all!

925
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,308
The winner is Junior's army.

926
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,711
Hitoshi Ozawa (Toyota Century)
60 km/h - DQ

927
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,879
Keiji Muto (Lincoln Navigator)
56 km/h - 3m 60cm - WIN

928
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,414
What?

929
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,086
I wonder if Ozawa is okay?

930
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:36,355
Muto's result is 3 meters, 60 centimeters.

931
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,626
I'm so glad that I won!

932
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,027
SENTOSHA

933
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:43,762
Here's the replay.

934
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,164
Here, they both turn
toward their opponent.

935
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,799
They both did it intentionally.

936
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,302
The 54-year-old Muto
and 55-year-old Ozawa.

937
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,137
Ozawa looks like he's having fun!

938
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:53,271
I wonder if got overexcited
in the beginning?

939
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,273
Let's have a look at how he went
for the rest of the race.

940
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,808
Did he brake at all?

941
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,744
He just drove straight into the wall!

942
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,748
Well, he is known for doing
his own stunts in movies.

943
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:06,385
Now, both teams are neck and neck,
at three wins and three losses each!

944
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:07,452
SENTOSHA

945
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,922
We never knew what he was trying to do.

946
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,392
-Well done!
-Yeah!

947
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,460
-Well done, Muto!
-You gave them hell.

948
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,065
A 54-year-old and a 55-year-old.

949
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,268
The warriors have completed their battle.

950
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:24,836
That's a nice scene.

951
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,905
Mr. Ozawa's not injured.

952
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,273
You should run, Mr. Ozawa!

953
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,075
He looks like he won or something!

954
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,411
Stop acting like you just won!

955
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,379
He looks so cool.

956
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,348
You just lost!

957
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,249
Mr. Ozawa!

958
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,518
Mr. Muto looks like he lost.

959
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,554
You didn't brake at all!

960
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,856
You didn't brake!

961
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:45,624
But, well...

962
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,893
I couldn't accelerate at all
in the Century.

963
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,361
Remember I told you
I'd reach 60 kilometers per hour?

964
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,697
I got there, but I fell down the cliff.

965
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,800
-You only needed 40 kilometers per hour.
-Why 60?

966
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,768
He reached 40 kilometers per hour easily.

967
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,170
I got there just in time.

968
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,738
You think the minimum speed
for you is 60 kilometers per hour?

969
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:00,906
That's right.

970
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,075
So you reached your minimum of 60.

971
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,476
I can't break my promise.

972
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,813
This means both teams
are at three wins and one draw.

973
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,982
This round will be decided by the result
of the last battle.

974
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,653
Last Battle

975
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,222
Here we go to the last battle!

976
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,591
We've got Ryuji Harada!

977
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:23,829
He's handsome.

978
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,798
We've got... Go ahead!

979
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,501
It's Yamamoto!

980
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,503
Let's go!

981
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,439
He's the guy that needs to be
censored on screen.

982
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:37,976
I don't need to be censored on Amazon!

983
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,077
Really?

984
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:42,114
You should apologize for disappearing
for ten years.

985
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,849
Ten years! Such a long time!

986
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,886
Everything will be decided
with this battle.

987
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,622
I won't waste what the others have done
for the team.

988
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,057
My target is...

989
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,960
Eight centimeters.

990
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:55,927
All right!

991
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,230
That's about the size of a rice ball!

992
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,331
That's about right.

993
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,700
My rice ball is about 15 centimeters.

994
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,404
What are you aiming for?

995
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,240
-2.5 centimeters!
-Yeah!

996
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,007

998
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,147
His battle car is an Audi Allroad Quattro.

999
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,784
This car is a crossover SUV that boasts
first class on-road performance,

1000
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,254
as well as the ability to adapt
to rugged terrain and go off-road.

1001

Engine 3.2L V6 DOHC Twin Turbo / 255 hp / 4WD / AT / Weight 1860kg

His battle car is the Toyota Corolla Van.

00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,830
With a maximum capacity of 400 kilograms,

1006
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:36,468

Resurrected after ten years of silence,
the Golden Boy, Keiichi Yamamoto

1009
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,275
I just have to go for it.

1010
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,846
The hero who makes your blood curdle
Ryuji Harada

1011
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,247
Today is a great day to die.

1012
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,016
I'll do my best.

1013
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:57,355
Now, the team that wins this final battle
will win the first round.

1014
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,926
I'm excited. I never imagined that

1015
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:04,529
the battle would come down
to the very last competitors.

1016
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,233
I can't lose this. I'll keep an eye out
for what the opponent is doing,

1017
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,335
and I'll go for it!

1018
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,605
Just go drive into the sunset!

1019
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,273
That's not a good idea.

1020
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,676
Let's go, Yamamoto!

1021
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:18,944
Ryuji Harada (Audi Allroad Quattro)
vs Keiichi Yamamoto (Toyota Corolla Van)

1022
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,512
Here's Yamamoto.

1023
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,982
He's the Golden Boy,
resurrected after ten years of silence.

1024
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,985
On the other hand...
He looks very serious.

1025
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,420
This is Ryuji Harada.

1026
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:35,427
Now, the destinies of the two armies fall
on the shoulders of these two men.

1027
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,195
-Let's go!
-Come on!

1028
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:39,664
They are both fired up!

1029
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:44,102
Three... Two... One...

1030
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:45,804
Go!

1031
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,206
Here they go!

1032
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,375
They both need to reach
40 kilometers per hour first.

1033
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,843
Harada's really stepping on it.

1034
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,679
I wonder if he can brake in time?
Is he going too fast?

1035
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,248
This is Yamamoto in his delivery van.

1036
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,149
They just have to hit the brakes!

1037
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,087
The result of this round rides
on this battle. They both stop!

1038
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,788
Yamamoto's done very well!

1039
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,258
Wow, this has turned into
an amazing battle!

1040
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:07,792
-Who won?
-How is it?

1041
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,462
The last battle looks to be the greatest!

1042
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,831
-We've won!
-We've won!

1043
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,699
It's us, it's us!

1044
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,235
-We've won!
-Who won?

1045
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:18,503
Who is it?

1046
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,305
This is so close!

1047
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,109
For now, it's hard to tell.

1048
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,244
SENTOSHA

1049
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,079
Let's have a look at the replay.

1050
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:32,150
Harada looked like he was
carrying way too much speed,

1051
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,252
but he brakes really hard right here.

1052
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,522
Harada's not touching the wall.
Yamamoto's done really well, too.

1053
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,658
It's hard to see because of the dust.

1054
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,692
SENTOSHA

1055
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:41,860
Who is the winner?

1056
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,028
I've got that 2.5 cm.

1057
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,430
Who won? It's me, right?

1058
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,034
This is quite amazing.

1059
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,470
Is it Junior or Hamada.

1060
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,439
It's so close!

1061
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:55,540
Such a close battle!

1062
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,708
We've won!

1063
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:57,642
We must have!

1064
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:03,048
The results are in!
Yamamoto is at 30 cm.

1065
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,083
Harada, wow, 1 cm!

1066
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,785
The winner is Junior's army!

1067
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:07,519
Yes!

1068
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,754
Junior's army wins.

1069
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,656
He hasn't touched the wall.

1070
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:12,724
Yes!

1071
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,560
The distance from the wall
is 1 centimeter.

1072
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,028
Keiichi Yamamoto (Toyota Corolla Van)
41 km/h - 30cm

1073
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,630
Ryuji Harada (Audi Allroad Quattro)
46 km/h - 1cm

1074
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,731
You're kidding!

1075
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,234
He's touching the wall.

1076
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,602
He's touching!

1077
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,439
He's touching!

1078
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,875
Ryuji hit the wall!

1079
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,010
SENTOSHA

1080
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:36,047
Hamada's army claims
that Harada has hit the wall.

1081
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,749
Let's have a look at the replay.

1082
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,451
He has... not touched it! The wall shook
from the wind pressure,

1083
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,553
but the car has not touched the wall!

1084
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,954
He really stopped
at one centimeter from the wall!

1085
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:43,955
He truly stopped at the very last moment!

1086
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:47,359
Even though Yamamoto has stopped
30 centimeters from the wall, he has lost.

1087
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,794
Junior's army draws first blood!

1088
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:54,399
That's amazing!

1089
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,202
Yeah!

1090
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,104
What...

1091
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,374
Mr. Yamamoto's result is 30 centimeters.

1092
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,377
I got as close as 30 centimeters
and I lost?

1093
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:07,479
We've won!

1094
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,014
Round One - Junior's army wins

1095
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,485
Hey, Hamada. Give us one of your cars!

1096
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,086
Hand it over.

1097
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,521
Give us one of your cars!

1098
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,356
Give us the Laurel.

1099
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:20,959
No way!

1100
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,894
We'll give you Katsumata's car.

1101
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,529
Katsumata's?

1102
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:25,964
It's my Fairlady Z!

1103
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,699
I bought it a long time ago.

1104
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,068
All right then.

1105
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,137
We'll accept the Fairlady Z.

1106
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:34,406
Thank you.

1107
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,477
Junior's army won the first round.

1108
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:43,048
After losing the first three battles,
they managed to turn the tide.

1109
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,216
Junior Castle is safe for now.

1110
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:50,955
Advance, kill them all!

1111
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,659
Retreat! Retreat for now!

1112
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,363
Through this defeat,

1113
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:01,966
Hamada's army
has lost Katsumata's Fairlady Z

1114
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,936
and are now clearly at a disadvantage.

1115
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,339
We've got another battle car in the works.

1116
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:14,446
The cruel warlord from Osaka
who will do anything to win.

1117
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:19,984
Hamada's next strategy will horrify
enemies and friends alike.

1118
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,620
I'll kill you all!

1119
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,459
Junior! Junior!

1120
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:30,095
You tiny little gorilla.
Come and get me!

1121
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,298
Please stop!

1122
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,437
-What's this?
-Just keep going.

1123
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,705
I can't see anything.

1124
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:42,874
What are you doing?

1125
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,175
Die!

1126
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,882
