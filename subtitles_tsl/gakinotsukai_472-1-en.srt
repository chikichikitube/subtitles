1
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,710
- Today, we're having a dodgeball match.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,939
- How many years has it been since you played?

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,089
- I wonder how many its been...

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,199
- But isn't it harder to play dodgeball after grade school? You're not as good once you grow.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,780
- I dunno.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,870
- He wouldn't even say "Probably." or "It seems like it would be." for you.

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,379
- That's why his solo show in Nagoya only sold twenty tickets.

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,949
- It was twenty-five!

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,609
In Tokyo, it was around 100.

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,390
- What was the capacity? - It could fit 300 people.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,149
- That's horrible.

12
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,140
* Yamazaki's Solo Show "Like Yamazaki" August 9, 1999 7PM Aoyama Circular Theatre *

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,969
- Even though it's a circular theatre with room for 300 people...

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,460
you couldn't make a circle with the 100 people.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,460
- Hurry. - Let's go, so we can play dodgeball.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,100
- What's wrong with that car?

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,810
- Why won't it go?

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,379
The car in front of us is saying like "Come here!".

19
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,679
- What happened? *Reluctantly, the group goes to help.*

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,349
- Fujiwara... - ... go out there for us...

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,810
We can bring a rope if they need it.

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,540
* Manager Fujiwara goes to listen to their needs *

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,680
- It... ita... It's Itao. - Itao-san?!

24
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,839
- Isn't that Itao? - It is.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,609
- What's wrong? Who is that with him? * Itao tells Fujiwara what happened *

26
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,489
- They're wearing the same clothes. - That must be his wife.

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,620
- They say we dented their car.

28
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:52,859
- They're saying we hit them in this car?!

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,200
- There wasn't any time where that happened.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,070
- He's looking at us.

31
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,409
He's looking hard.... - He even got up close.

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,870
- He's not going to go away. Let's just hurry up.

33
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,789
- What's going on out here? - Ah, good morning.

34
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,119
- What's up? - Well, you seem to have hit me.

35
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,070
- Eh?! We did all this?! - Yep.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,550
- Umm... and she is? - Um, this is my wife!

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,560
- This one's different than the one we went to your wedding party for.

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,599
- No, that's not it at all.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,330
It's not it at all, right?! - Of course.

40
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,889
- Anyway... Itao, we don't have any mark on our van.

41
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:52,650
- I bet you probably do have one.

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,400
- To do this, they must have hit you hard.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,069
Maybe someone hit you before and you didn't notice?

44
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,489
- Looks like it was from something round. - No, no. It wasn't like that when we left.

45
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,409
Even so, come look over here.

46
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,979
You guys knocked over my stew over!

47
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,139
- Why did you guys make stew? - I thought "Let's go see my parents."

48
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,519
So we made some and put it in our car to take to them.

49
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,750
This thing won't even close anymore.

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,889
The insides are all scrambled now!

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,219
- Were they like that before? - No, they weren't.

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,980
It was from the impact. It had to from the impact, didn't it?

53
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,299
- Of course.

54
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,789
- Well, I'm sorry, but... - This seems odd.

55
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,969
I still think you're wrong, Itao.

56
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,840
I think you didn't notice it before you got in.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,990
- Either way, we still have a location shoot to do.

58
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,329
- We don't really have much time, and it might rain.

59
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,329
- I think I can feel my neck starting to hurt.

60
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,390
- Were you geing serious?

61
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,229
- There's nothing wrong with your wife, right? - Is your neck okay?

62
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,229
I think she's fine, but... oh man, your neck is really hot here.

63
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,530
* Itao checks on his beloved wife *

64
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,410
- We have to go have our match, and then we've got a talk to do.

65
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,970
- We still have a talk to do. What time is it? We should try to hurry.

66
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,730
- And it looks like rain.

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,770
- Since we can't do our location shoot if it either of those happen...

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,410
- But first, can I get something from Nihon TV?

69
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,590
Even if it's just for the damage to the car...

70
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,349
- We can talk about whether we hit him or not later. * Itao requests money to fix the car *

71
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,100
- For now, just take that.

72
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,169
- Okay, we'll leave it like that for now.

73
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:49,939
I understand.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
* After being held up in an unexpected place, the team finally heads to the location shoot *

75
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:02,679
- Gaki No Tsukai's first ever: "Hit 'em, Hit 'em, Hit 'em hard!" 100000 yen Summer Dodgeball Match!

76
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:11,899
Matsumoto Team: Hitoshi Matsumoto and Naoki Tanaka Hamada Team: Masatoshi Hamada and Shouzo Endou

77
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,269
* Out!!! *

78
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,649
* Yamazaki notices something *

79
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
- Matsumoto... - What?

80
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,889
- Itao's here.

81
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,522
- What's going on?

82
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,572
- They said there's something wrong with our necks.

83
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,382
- You went to the hospital? - Yep.

84
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:55,742
- As you can see, my skull's got cracks in it.

85
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,662
- This here? - Yes. - That's not your neck, right? - Yes.

86
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,472
- This here's my woman.

87
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:07,132
- When you say your "woman", you mean your wife?

88
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:09,752
- What are we going to do?

89
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,252
* Itao is asking for medical compensation in addition to the car maintenance money *

90
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:13,963
- When you say "What should we do"....

91
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:17,762
- Well, right now we're doing a location shoot. - Yes, we're actually shooting.

92
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:22,882
- I understand that us playing dodgeball doesn't really matter to you, since you've been injured...

93
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,883
but this is our job, and we have to get this done.

94
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,442
- Well, I've been on the show before. My wife was too.

95
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,093
Like when you hit my car.

96
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,983
- But we won't be showing that on-air.

97
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,402
- But just in case I do show up...

98
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:45,052
I think I should get an appearance fee for that as well.

99
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,403
- I don't think so, since that isn't part of the show. * This time, Itao is requesting an appearance fee *

100
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:54,473
- The cameras were spinning and acting like it would be on air, so I believed it.

101
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,633
I thought I'd be appearing as a talent.

102
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,162
It isn't normal circumstances.

103
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:06,052
Thinking I was a guest, I did things for the camera...

104
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:10,162
So, I should get paid.

105
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:14,903
- I'll talk with Mr. Tokuoka about getting you money for your car and for your appearance fee.

106
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:18,653
I'll talk to them, so please let them do this opening.

107
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:21,303
- What are you guys doing? - Dodgeball.

108
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:29,802
- Well, since I'm going to be on the show anyway, I should earn my appearance fee, right?

109
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:32,673
- If we did that, we'd have 3 teams. - And we can't do that, so no need to help.

110
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:36,592
- And you guys are injured.

111
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,612
- I'll do it anyway.

112
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:43,023
- If you did, we would ask some staff to play.

113
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,143
- The staff is no good.

114
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:46,792
Let my wife play with us!

115
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:50,123
- We can't do it with her. - Don't you want to do this together with my wife?!

116
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:53,263
To make the time pass quickly.

117
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:58,162
- Uh, Wife, will you do it?

118
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,673
- Of course.

119
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,143
- Suga-san, what are we going to do?

120
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:11,402
- Let's put the wife in and make this 3-on-3.

121
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:12,752
- You serious? - Yes.

122
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,703
- Does the game have prize money?

123
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,203
- Yes, it does. - How much?

124
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:19,122
- 100000 yen. - 100000 yen? Let's take it to 1 million yen.

125
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,393
- A million's a little much, isn't it?

126
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,652
- Even if you win, it's hard to just accept that much.

127
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,693
- A million will be fine.

128
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:34,973
- Okay, we'll do a million. Since we're paying, let's do this again quickly.

129
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:38,323
It looks like it's going to rain, but we have to finish the shoot.

130
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:44,313
- What are we going to do? - As far as teams.

131
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:46,372
- Well, right now, what are the teams like?

132
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:49,082
- Right now, it's red team vs blue team.

133
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,303
- Then I'll go on Hamada's team. Wife, you can go on Matsumoto's team.

134
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:55,983
- You okay to play? - You can, can't you? * Itao divides the teams to get money, whoever wins *

135
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:57,603
- Of course.

136
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:03,653
- Ready?!

137
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:04,663
GO!

138
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,313
* OUT!!! *

139
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:23,353
- You okay?!

140
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:25,682
- Wife, he hit you. You've been hit.

141
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:31,733
- I only hit her a little on the leg.

142
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,413
- What's wrong? - She's dead!

143
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:40,443
- Dead?! I only hit her lightly on the leg.

144
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:41,683
- That's no reason to die.

145
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:42,772
- Hey!

146
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:48,503
Even if she didn't die, you would have put her in an ambulance.

147
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:54,203
- I guess it couldn't be helped.

148
00:09:56,953 --> 00:10:00,513
I can't really be helped that getting all excited and then getting hit on the leg killed her, can it?

149
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,873
- All the stuff from before just mixed and added to it.

150
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:06,782
- Ah, from before...

151
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,662
- But as far as a decision goes... Our team won, right?

152
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:13,002
- There's no winner and no loser.

153
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,792
- Well, I mean, we still have the prize money...

154
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,263
- Is your wife going to be okay?

155
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,163
- More important than the money...

156
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,292
Is she okay and do we have to call an ambulance?

157
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,773
- Right now the prize money doesn't matter.

158
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:38,293
What is it? - That just leaves things unsettled.

159
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:42,182
What?! I don't even get a little bit of the money?

160
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,043
- What's wrong with you? Money?

161
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:50,082
Do you only want the money?

162
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,023
- Hell yeah, I want my money!

163
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,313
- Even so, maybe we should call an ambulance.

164
00:10:57,662 --> 00:11:00,162
- No, let's deal with the prize money first, before we go calling ambulances.

165
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:03,972
- What the hell? You're wife's down, shouldn't it be the ambulance first?

166
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,413
- I know you think it's odd, but look at it from my point of view.

167
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,552
Think about why the money comes first.

168
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:12,222
- If I were you, I'd call an ambulance.

169
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,923
- You just don't understand my point of view!

170
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,603
I knew you would say something like that.

171
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:19,873
But try stepping over here.

172
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,063
First comes the money. Money, then ambulance.

173
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:23,773
Ambulance then money would just be odd.

174
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:27,662
- I guess it's just that type of thing.

175
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:31,073
- For now, I'll be fine with the money you have here.

176
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,332
* Itao frankly asks for the money *

177
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:38,872
- We brought the 100000 yen for the original prize.

178
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,462
So as a start, please, take this.

179
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,652
- As a start. - As a start?

180
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:51,763
- We'll send the remainder to you. It will be coming at a later date.

181
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,432
The appearance fee will come too. - Good.

182
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:56,412
If it was just 100000 yen, this would be it.

183
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:01,052
But since it was a million, you'll be sending 900000 yen later, right?

184
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,162
- That was the money, so now for an ambulance...

185
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:12,402
- Since I've got the money... Okay, now you understand.

186
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,353
- Itao-san... your wife...

187
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,592
- Itao-san... your wife...

188
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,652
- What the hell?! - The wife... Ah!

189
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,692
- Get up, you liar!

190
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,623
Don't make up lies like that.

191
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,222
- You're his wife, aren't you?

192
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:32,393
Of course.

193
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:42,623
- Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

194
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:45,842
- Where are you going?! - Itao went over there!

195
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,422
- We'll get even next time.
