1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
First Ever on Gaki No Tsukai CHIKI CHIKI!

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,390
It's not 10,000, or even 50,000!

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,760
You can definitely win this; 30,000 yen competition! (~$300)

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,060
So Matsumoto-san, what are we doing this time?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,120
Well .. this time ... uhh

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,720
These comedians will showcase a talent worth 30,000 yen

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,340
They say a salaryman's monthly allowance is around 30,000 yen

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,280
Also, if you go to a brothel,

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,260
a ****-job is around that much, desu ne?

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,120
- A ****-job?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,560
Yes, if I were to see something worth that much today

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,660
I will be very grateful

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,660
Showcase your 30,000 yen talent!

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:53,640
All three judges need to agree your talent is worth 30,000 yen to win this prize money!

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,440
If you show us something really amazing you might even win 100,000 yen! (~$1000)

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,450
- Oh so we can win over this amount?
 - Yes think of it as my "special service"

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,980
And of course, we have guest stars for this episode

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,980
- yoroshiku onegaishimasu
 - yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,980
But uh ... him over there

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,040
- Eh?!

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,660
I genuinely did not notice him

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,640
He's been there the whole time,

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,780
he was there before we arrived,

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,840
and has not spoken a single word

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,240
What technique of being unfunny is this?

26
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,580
I will perform some tap dancing for everyone here today

27
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,040
I've practiced to the point where I think I deserve at least 30,000 yen

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,120
- So that's what I want to show you

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,180
- So that's what I want to show you
 - A 30,000 yen tap dance?

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,560
Endo will tap dance to the Gaki theme song!

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,390
Will he win the 30,000 yen?!

32
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,420
Ok here we go, onegaishimasu!

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,010
- It's not in sync
 - Is it in sync?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,680
It doesn't match the music

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,180
- He's just messing about
 - It's supposed be like this?

36
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,620
So lame LOL!

37
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,120
Ok judges, write down his prize money

38
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,020
While he was dancing, you guys were all,

39
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,880
"What the hell is this?"

40
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,220
- I thought I did pretty well!

41
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,980
- I thought I did pretty well!
 - Looks like the judges are done writing

42
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,500
So with that said, present your impressions!

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,040
- 10K yen, 8K yen,

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,860
- 600 yen
 - 600 yen?! (~ $6)

45
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,600
Wait, wait, wait really only 600 yen?

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,420
Well my impression was,

47
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,600
exactly enough

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,020
to not afford the toll road fee

49
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,600
I will, in the crevices of my neck,

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
store some liquid

51
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,040
Uhhh, sorry but,

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I have no idea what the hell you just said

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,420
Yeah I made less sense that I though I would

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,020
This - look at these please

55
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,700
I can make crevices here, can you see them?

56
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,500
In here, I will put the drinks

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,320
Understood, please begin!

58
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,320
- Oh I see
 - He will do it himself

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,360
- Oh it's working
 - He's putting a lot in!

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
- Oh it spilled
 -It's spilling

61
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,920
You're kidding right?

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,440
He's spilling it already?

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,160
I get he might spill it, but he's already spilling it?

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,920
It's too soon

65
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,320
What the hell is his plan?

66
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,380
you can do it!

67
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,520
Why is his hand like that?

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,560
He's trying to make them deeper

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,060
You're kidding right?!

70
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,780
I'm to take this coffee, mix it with the milk,

71
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,240
and make a cafe au lait

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,580
Well, I don't think you can do it

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,760
There's not enough coffee or milk

74
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,400
- He can do it
 - It might work

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,320
It won't reach it!

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,740
Ok judges ...

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,920
Write down his prize money

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,940
That was amazing

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,380
What is this

80
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,640
Ok, present your impressions!

81
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,900
Well, if the previous one cannot enter the metropolitan toll road,

82
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,560
He can at least enter the ETC

83
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,400
This is pretty terrible right?

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,870
This has been terrible since the NTV opening

85
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,900
To rank this among NTV shows,

86
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,470
it would be faster to count from the bottom

87
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,400
Koutoge-kun, you failed to win the prize money

88
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,130
Honestly, I could have put more liquid in

89
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,000
I was nervous, and my hands were shaking, and I messed up

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,300
... This is just a normal excuse, I'm sorry

91
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,600
- How do I say this, everyone is taking this in the wrong direction

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,170
- How do I say this, everyone is taking this in the wrong direction
 -This is tough

93
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,970
These three <i>want</i> to give you the money!

94
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,160
I'm just saying, If someone came to your house and did that,

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,300
Would you pay them 30,000 yen?

96
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,000
- No
 - No we wouldn't

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,530
- Absolutely would not
 - Right?

98
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,050
So, who will go nex-

99
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,330
Wait!

100
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,600
He finally spoke

101
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,950
Allow me to go next

102
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,900
Think you can win?

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,900
These guys need to understand what a 30,000 yen performance really is

104
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,950
- Yes I think it's about time

105
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,750
- License!
 - Yes?

106
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,750
- Come help me out
 - Ok, what should we do

107
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,550
Take this box to the stage over there

108
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,280
- We're gonna switch to the stage now
 - Ok take him out front

109
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,930
When did he arrive to the studio?

110
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,650
(Housei has been on standby for 6 hours)

111
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,280
That guy, no matter what he does,

112
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,330
he costs us a lot of money and time

113
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,550
I guess you're right

114
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,900
Who the hell spends over 30K yen to win a prize of just 30K yen?

115
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,400
Looks like he's ready!

116
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
I'm a ninja!

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,320
That is my performance, a ninja!

118
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,980
a ninja?

119
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,080
Understood, please begin!

120
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,860
♩ Hide your, bo-o-dy! ♫

121
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,880
That's it?

122
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,750
- You're kidding right?

123
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,600
- You're kidding right?
 - This is a joke right?

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Is that all this is?

125
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Finished!

126
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,850
He's done huh?

127
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,880
How much prize money does this deserve?

128
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,850
Prize money for this?

129
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,500
The guy who did the art did the real work

130
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,130
He's smiling so much

131
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,230
The guy who did the art is amazing though

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,020
I was invisible for a second right?

133
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,200
because ninja

134
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,680
Maybe you could see me,

135
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,900
but you had no idea where I was right?

136
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,030
They matched! (~$1)

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,860
- But you don't win any money!
 - They match though!

138
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,300
No, no, you need to get 30k from all of us!

139
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,320
- You won't get 100 yen
 - Yeah that's right

140
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,580
- Of course you won't
 - Please sit down

141
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,620
He's not satisfied with that at all

142
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,320
Yeah I like, really hated that

143
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,980
"really hated" ?

144
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,620
Ok next up, Naomi!

145
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,160
I will continuously receive volleyballs

146
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,940
I was captain of the volleyball team in middle school

147
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,940
I won't let them fall to the ground

148
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,710
- So if they fall to the ground, that's a failure?
 - That's a failure

149
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,720
You better give out that 30k yen soon!

150
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,340
Says the guy who won 100 yen

151
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,880
This is the kind of thing we should see

152
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,880
- Woah that's close
 - Kinda scary

153
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,740
Make it go faster

154
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,620
I guess it does hurt!

155
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,320
Spread it out

156
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,940
Use your hands!

157
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,160
No no no no !

158
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,160
She could only do it in the beginning

159
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,520
That's not the way to do it

160
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,900
That's enough, we're finished!

161
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,860
Write down her prize money please

162
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,360
Okay please present your impressions!

163
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,060
that was close!

164
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,400
What were you doing here?

165
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,480
I continously recieved volleyba-

166
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,460
You totally didn't though! Only for like the first three

167
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,860
well yes, but I didn't let them hit the floor

168
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,860
- She even used her feet for that
 - That really hurt didn't it?

169
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
It really really hurts

170
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,640
Heipo what do you think of all this?

171
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,080
Volleyball right? I think most people could do better

172
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,760
- Heipo can also do it
 - Really?

173
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,740
- I used to play volleyball
 - Get it ready for him

174
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,280
You used to play volleyball?

175
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,080
I played soccer and volleyball

176
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,300
Please show us

177
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,700
That was so quick!

178
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,260
- Please allow me to go next
 - Ok go!

179
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,860
You guys know what this is right?

180
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,090
Matsumoto-san you probably use this for working out; This is a medicine ball

181
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,380
It's full of sand, and weighs about 4kg (0.63 stone)

182
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,470
I just want to demonstrate its proper usage

183
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,620
Koutoge, come here a second

184
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,620
I just want to demonstrate the proper usage

185
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,620
This is used for strength training

186
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,490
- Wait that's 4kg?
 - Yes 4kg

187
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,270
Boxers use this to train their body by having it dropped on themselves

188
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,180
Wait a minute, is his dick hard?

189
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,330
If you can get hard in this situation, you can have the 30,000!

190
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,670
So that was the proper way to use this

191
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,890
But using this 4kg ball, I will do lifting

192
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,290
If you <i>can</i> do that it would be pretty impressive

193
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,820
Here I go!

194
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,670
Honestly man...

195
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,670
One of you bastards, go next!

196
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,220
- Wait it's ok!
 - He's still not done!

197
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,640
I'm still not done!

198
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,890
Hold on you didn't say how many times you're gonna do it

199
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,890
Well since it's a 4kg ball, 10 times

200
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,490
That was fantastic!

201
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,600
Okay, okay

202
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,380
Judges, this is how heavy the ball he just kicked is

203
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,710
So take that into consideration

204
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,980
So judges please write down his prize money!

205
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,560
Seriously though, if you guys don't get it together,

206
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,000
We're the ones who take the blame for this show right?

207
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,840
I'm counting on you

208
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,560
Ok judges, are you ready?

209
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,130
Present your impressions!

210
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,710
So close!

211
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,560
This is a good score

212
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,620
The best we've had today

213
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,620
It wasn't good enough for the full 30k,

214
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,190
but certainly, that was not something that anyone can do

215
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,670
Just a bit more huh?

216
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,560
It wasn't enough

217
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,090
It wasn't enough, but I've created some momentum haven't I?

218
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,930
Let's keep going from here!

219
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,330
That was almost good enough, let's improve on that!

220
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,160
Who wants to go next? Tsukajiro?

221
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,800
Keep this momentum going

222
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,180
What is your performance?

223
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,530
The theme of the anime "3000 Leagues in Search of Mother"

224
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,470
I will sing it full of emotion, and cry

225
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,490
This does seem like something he can do

226
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,930
Ready Tsukajiro?

227
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,070
He's already in the zone!

228
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,070
He has to keep Inomoto's momentum going

229
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,240
Here comes the chorus

230
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,450
The tears are coming

231
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,360
Anytime now they'll come

232
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
C'mon, fall!

233
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,700
Nevermind he lost it

234
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,860
This is gonna take some time

235
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,280
This is not what I imagined

236
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,620
Seriously?

237
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,440
Why'd he cry after it ends?

238
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,440
He's trying again right now for no reason

239
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,280
- He's trying to force it
 - He can do it now!

240
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
No that's not right, what is he doing?

241
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,280
He's crying, tears are coming out!

242
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,840
This has nothing to do with the song

243
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,900
Uwah I'm just being lied to

244
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,060
I've been lied to!

245
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,740
This is impossible

246
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,260
Write his prize money!

247
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,320
- He might cry
 - he might cry

248
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,320
Even if he cries now, who cares?

249
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,320
He was supposed to cry while singing

250
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,060
You failed!

251
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,480
- He's crying now
 - Tears are coming

252
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,700
He cried after seeing his score

253
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,620
That anime was completely irrelevant huh?

254
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,500
If you ask me though,

255
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,780
I was simply lied to by my junior

256
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,180
The score went up a bit from Inomoto this time though

257
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,180
There's no point in crying now!

258
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,790
- This time for real!
 - Did he cry?
 - He did!

259
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,560
The song was absolutely pointless

260
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,450
My performan-

261
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,970
- We're counting on you man
 - Don't worry

262
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,030
- I've got something really good

263
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,930
- I've got something really good
 - What?

264
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,570
Using a pube I found in the dressing room,

265
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,610
I'm gonna make a bracelet

266
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,230
That <i>is</i> really good!

267
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,320
Ah wait,

268
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,600
Wait,

269
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:33,820
WAIT!

270
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,760
That's not it!

271
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,180
That's not it?!

272
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,920
- You got that mixed up with something else?
 - Yes I apologise

273
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,960
Using this Shanghai here,

274
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,140
Ah wait,

275
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,460
Wait,

276
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:44,720
WAIT!

277
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,480
- You mistook that for something else?! -
 Completely the wrong word

278
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,160
- Look at it properly!
 - This guy is gonna raise the score?

279
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,720
This apple here right?

280
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,620
Normally you use a knife to cut it right?

281
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,120
So without using a knife,

282
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,240
A single bite size - exactly that size, I'll bring that over to you

283
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
- A single bite size?
 - Yes I'll bring that right over to you

284
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,960
- So you see this case right?
 - Yes

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,400
An apple bite just this size, I'll bring that right over to you

286
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,660
- Are you ready?

287
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,220
I guess, I, AM

288
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,740
- Ok, here we go
 - Wait sorry hold on

289
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,980
- What the hell?
 - Sorry my bad

290
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,400
You said you were ready

291
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,500
Here we go

292
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,640
- I guess, I, AM
 - What the hell?

293
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,200
So a piece exactly this size

294
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,360
Take this seriously you bastards!

295
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,920
Just what is this?

296
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,000
- I-I'll do it again for you
 - Do it again, I don't get it

297
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,820
Okay so you bite it ...

298
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,260
What are you trying to do?

299
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,520
This is something anyone can do LOL

300
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
I just don't get the rules

301
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,680
This so messed up

302
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,640
That piece is too big

303
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,840
Why the hell?!

304
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,380
I have no idea what you were trying to do

305
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,280
Just tell us whether or not he gets the prize money

306
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:05,740
Well it's true that I laughed,

307
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,080
If I was even a little bit sick, I wouldn't have laughed at all
