00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:18,233
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,500
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:28,834
We don't have the formidable Cookie
here with us this time...

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,233
...but few players
are equally formidable here.

5
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,133
Each comedian has their strong suit.

6
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:40,333
It's becoming clearer
what kind of comedian...

7
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,367
...is best suited for Documental.

8
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,433
Seriously?

9
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,000
We had drinks the other day!

10
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,467
What do you think is
the ideal way for the show to unfold?

11
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:59,934
We're at the stage where you start to
consider all the possible scenarios.

12
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,767
One series could even end in five minutes.

13
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:08,433
Five minutes in,
everyone bursts into laughter,

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,000
and that's it.

15
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:13,467
Or everyone could laugh all at once,
and just walk out.

16
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,367
I've been thinking,
"That might happen one day.

17
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:19,166
I hope it does. But would that be okay?"

18
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,133
I have a lot of ideas regarding
the ideal Documental.

19
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,233
Hello.

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm Junichiro Koizumi.

21
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,367
Junior...

22
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,300
Let's continue.

23
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,367
Is there a magic marker somewhere?

24
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,400
I want to write my name
on the water bottle.

25
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:15,433
-This isn't a permanent marker, but...
-That'll do.

26
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,300
Who cares which bottle belongs to who?

27
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,500
Will it write?

28
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,967
My mouth isn't that dirty.

29
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,567
Why did you write "Maya Hayashi"?

30
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,533
MAYA HAYASHI

31
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,934
Anyone's name will do.

32
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,567
-I know it's mine.
-He knows.

33
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,600
I know my bottle says "Maya Hayashi."

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,567
Okay?

35
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,266
"Passion Yara."

36
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,200
YARA

37
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,900
-That guy?
-Yes.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,300
The guy who does this?

39
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,400
Choge choge passion

40
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:58,433
Please take a look.

41
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,600
-He said, "Choge choge passion."
-Junior...

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,166
Choge choge passion

43
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,700
Hey, you're not looking.

44
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,400
Takahashi and Junior are so fragile.

45
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:20,867
"Choge choge passion."

46
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,834
-Take turns writing your name.
-That's impressive.

47
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,033
Kobayashi is amazing.

48
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,967
-We have to know whose is which.
-Write so we know.

49
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,834
"Wankosoba Taro." Who's that?

50
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,100
"Wanko Sobataro"?

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,533
Who is "Wanko Sobataro"?

52
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,633
It's the fake name I use when
I try to make people laugh with a name.

53
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,734
"Wanko Sobataro"?

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,133
"Wankosoba Taro."

55
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,667
-"Wankosoba Taro"?
-Not "Wanko Sobataro"?

56
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,500
"Wan..." "Wankoso..."

57
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,000
"Wankosobataro"?

58
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,867
"Wankosoba Taro," right?

59
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,667
It's "Wankosoba..."

60
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,567
No, hang on.

61
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,967
Yeah, it's "Wankosoba Taro."

62
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,333
Not "Wankoso Bataro"?

63
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,100
Is it "Wankoso Bataro"?

64
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,934
"Wankoso Bataro"?

65
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,033
-"Bataro..."
-"Wanko Sobataro"?

66
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,266
That's it!

67
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,834
Who's "Wanko Sobataro"?

68
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,667
It's the name I always use
to make people laugh.

69
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:10,800
Like when?

70
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,400
"Wanko F. Bataro"?

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,834
No, that's wrong.

72
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,633
It's "Wanko Sobataro."

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,367
You know what I mean, right?

74
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:24,000
Sometimes you try to make people laugh
with a funny name.

75
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:27,333
This is the name I use on such occasions.

76
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,433
Reiji says he always uses "Riho Makise."

77
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,533
I understand.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,100
It's something that changes over time.
Each era has its own.

79
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,266
Should we do something?

80
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,834
Let's finish writing our names.
We have to do that, right?

81
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,200
Well, any name will do.

82
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,300
But, Jinnai...

83
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,300
The bad thing about Jinnai is...

84
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:49,734
I shouldn't say "bad."

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,633
The one thing that worries me
about Jinnai is,

86
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,266
he's often considered an all-rounder,

87
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:58,300
but he totally sucks at oogiri games.

88
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,800
When I asked him to name a new superhero,
he said,

89
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,066
"Masked Rider: Policing."

90
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,100
What the heck is that?

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
I wrote mine.

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,467
-What is it?
-"Wanko Sobajiro."

93
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,266
They're brothers?

94
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,467
We have similar names?
What a funny coincidence.

95
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,600
Is it "Wankosoba Jiro"?

96
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,500
"Wan Kosobajiro."

97
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,433
"Wan..." "Wan Kosobajiro"?

98
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,433
-Then they're different.
-"Wanko Sobataro"?

99
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,734
And Jiro...

100
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,133
"Wankoso..."

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,834
Come up with one already!

102
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,333
Don't overthink it, Tamura.

103
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,233
How long have we been waiting?

104
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,033
Only you have to get it.

105
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,133
Okay.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,300
"Ichiro."

107
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,100
That's the only wrong answer.

108
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,767
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

109
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:06,900
Jimmy.

110
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:10,667
-You said any name would do.
-Any name would've done, except that.

111
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,233
Out of all the names in the universe?

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,266
Because "Ichi" means number one?

113
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,133
Number one was the worst...

114
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,133
Jimmy?

115
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,266
-Jimmy.
-Yes?

116
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,533
Jimmy!

117
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,367
What did you laugh at?

118
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,567
What was so funny?

119
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,166
I'd been holding it in since "Ichiro."

120
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,100
I know what you mean.
"Ichiro" almost got me too.

121
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,667
-What was so funny?
-Wait. "Ichiro..."

122
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,133
I don't get why you laughed.

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,000
After thinking for so long,
that's all he came up with.

124
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,567
-You couldn't let that go?
-It kept nagging me.

125
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:58,500
Then halfway through,
they started looking at me.

126
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,300
"Ichiro."

127
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,100
Jimmy?

128
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,200
-Jimmy.
-Yes?

129
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,467
Jimmy!

130
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,300
Junior and Takahashi were borderline
the whole time.

131
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,967
-What? During that last bit?
-You were close.

132
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:22,867
For real?

133
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:26,166
Junior almost lost it
with that Passion Yara bit.

134
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,033
-You laughed at Passion Yara.
-I didn't.

135
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,300
-He covered his smile.
-I didn't laugh.

136
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,600
But Jimmy did. So...

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,033
You were smiling most of the time.

138
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,934
-No, I wasn't!
-The whole time.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,266
-He smiles every time someone speaks.
-That "Ichiro" bit wasn't funny at all.

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,533
Not funny at all!

141
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,567
You don't have to point fingers.

142
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,533
-That guy.
-Jimmy laughed anyway.

143
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,333
Who drags it out so much
for something so unfunny?

144
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Wouldn't you have laughed?
After being made to wait for so long.

145
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,300
-He thought so hard.
-Well.

146
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,367
-Let's be careful.
-We're all okay?

147
00:08:58,433 --> 00:08:59,600
Do be careful.

148
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,333
-Junior laughed a little.
-He did, right?

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,934
When you said
"Ichiro" was the worst answer.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,700
-You giggled.
-Really?

151
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,400
But I have a habit of smiling
when I talk, right?

152
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:13,333
-We can't do that either?
-Right. We have to be careful.

153
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,500
We can't do that either...

154
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:22,400
-I think we've had enough of funny names.
-Yeah, it's a bit tough.

155
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,333
-But Jimmy kept one up his sleeve.
-No, I didn't.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,033
-You wanted us to keep writing names.
-No way. I have nothing.

157
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,700
What did you write?

158
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,734
It's a little hard to read.

159
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:34,700
"Purin Hime."

160
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
-I know that name.
-She's a classmate.

161
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,400
-She's our classmate?
-At NSC.

162
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,233
She's the one that Zakoshisyoh

163
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,900
tried to lose his virginity with,
but failed.

164
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,000
-Really?
-Right.

165
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,800
-You held hands all night.
-Yes.

166
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,200
-You liked her?
-I did.

167
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:52,000
-She wore Gothic Lolita fashion.
-That's right.

168
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,700
She looked like she was good at blowjobs.

169
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,166
She looked like she was good at blowjobs.

170
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:03,500
After that, since he was still a virgin,
he said, "I'll try picking up a girl."

171
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,300
He wanted me to join him.

172
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,600
So we went.

173
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,633
Jimmy...

174
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,433
-He picked up a girl.
-Jimmy...

175
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
They went to a love hotel,
but he wanted me to come.

176
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:14,433
Jimmy.

177
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,967
He wanted me to watch.

178
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,033
Takahashi and Jimmy.

179
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,934
Then he lost his virginity.

180
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,867
Jimmy?

181
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,266
And then...

182
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,333
He calls me "Bayashi."

183
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,000
He said, "I'm coming!

184
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,734
"Bayashi, what should I do?"

185
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
I said, "Just come."

186
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:43,200
I heard about it at the time.

187
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,767
Zakoshisyoh said he'd lost his virginity.

188
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,667
When I asked him how it was, he said,

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,166
"A gum-like substance came out."

190
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,500
Who was that?

191
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,967
Me?

192
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,133
It wasn't me!

193
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,900
-Was it me?
-I was close.

194
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,467
Jimmy, you were laughing before that, too!

195
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,033
-You were laughing the whole time!
-But...

196
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,166
What was that face?

197
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,400
It's Jimmy that almost makes us laugh.
With that face.

198
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:20,834
Hang on. Someone else must have laughed.

199
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,000
-Wait a minute!
-You laughed first.

200
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,767
-Let's ask the judge.
-You laughed in my face.

201
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,433
-When I turned you.
-No, no!

202
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,867
Judge?

203
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:30,467
Don't call me "Judge."

204
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,367
I don't think it was me. It's--

205
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,333
Junior.

206
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,834
How quick!

207
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,767
-Junior, you're on your last life.
-One more to go.

208
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:39,867
You're in trouble.

209
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,066
Was I laughing?

210
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,033
You were. Let's take a look.

211
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,300
When I asked him how it was, he said,

212
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,600
"A gum-like substance came out."

213
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,900
I'm holding it in!

214
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:55,467
I held it in!

215
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,567
I was on the edge, but I kept it.

216
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,200
That's why I'm not giving you a red card.

217
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,133
It's not a red card, but...

218
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,900
-He's in trouble now.
-That was out, right?

219
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,767
You were swaying all over.

220
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,734
You really need to tread carefully now.
Seriously.

221
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,133
-Junior, you're in trouble now.
-It hasn't even been 30 minutes.

222
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,767
I want Junior to stay longer.

223
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,300
-He only has one more chance?
-I'm in trouble.

224
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:18,800
The next time, he's out.

225
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,000
That was fast.

226
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:25,200
Part of me looks forward to seeing
Junior as a zombie,

227
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,734
but please try your best to win--

228
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,300
Hey, wait. Who put this egg here?

229
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,667
It's not that big a joke.

230
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,300
It's no big deal.

231
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,166
It's not that evil a deed.

232
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,400
What's the point of finding who did it?

233
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,300
I wanted to solve this mystery.

234
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,767
Who'd laugh at this anyway?

235
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,266
It bothers me!

236
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,367
Jimmy, please.

237
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,533
Has age made you far-sighted?

238
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,700
Near-sighted.

239
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,667
How old are you?

240
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,467
Fifty-four.

241
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,133
-I'm getting far-sighted.
-What did he write?

242
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,467
"Kano Hospital."

243
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,166
-Kano Hospital?
-Yes.

244
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,967
You go there?

245
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,000
You work there?

246
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:20,900
No...

247
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,467
I was hospitalized there.

248
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,100
Why were you hospitalized?

249
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,066
Why were you hospitalized?

250
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,567
Yeah, well...

251
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,467
I can't say that on TV.

252
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:35,033
-You can't say it on TV?
-It's that bad?

253
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,500
No, it's okay. You can say
the name of medical conditions.

254
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,700
It happened to you.

255
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,767
What was it?

256
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:46,734
Well, first they examined me,
then they ran electricity through me.

257
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,300
-What?
-They ran electricity through you?

258
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,100
-Where?
-My head.

259
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,767
When was this?

260
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,433
When did that happen?

261
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,233
-Yamauchi...
-Well...

262
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,867
-Yamauchi.
-They told me to go to the hospital.

263
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:00,900
Who told you?

264
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,834
The police.

265
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,100
The police?

266
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,667
The police?

267
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,433
You did something wrong?

268
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,433
-No, I didn't do anything wrong. But...
-Out of the blue?

269
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,200
-They stopped you on the street?
-They stopped me...

270
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,133
-And they told you to go to the hospital?
-Yeah.

271
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:17,467
So I went.

272
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,467
-Were you hospitalized?
-Well, the hospital...

273
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,000
Or did you just visit?

274
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,333
In the beginning, I was just visiting.

275
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,200
I was hospitalized for three days.

276
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,800
Which is it?

277
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:33,433
-Was he an outpatient or inpatient?
-I was an outpatient first.

278
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,300
-Then you became an inpatient?
-I went from outpatient to inpatient.

279
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,533
-At Kano Memorial Hospital?
-Yes.

280
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,700
"Memorial"?

281
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,400
When did you think of writing that
on your bottle?

282
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,767
When did you decide?

283
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,300
Since "Ichiro."

284
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,567
When he wrote "Ichiro"?

285
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,867
Jimmy.

286
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,834
Like I said, Jimmy.

287
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,767
Does it actually exist?

288
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,500
You have such a cute face now.

289
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,333
-You came up with the idea at "Ichiro"?
-When he wrote "Ichiro."

290
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,533
-Wow.
-You must like Ichiro a lot.

291
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,567
-Do you like Ichiro?
-Ichiro...

292
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,533
Have you always liked him?

293
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,133
Cut it out.

294
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,834
-Sorry.
-I've had enough of that.

295
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,767
Kano Hospital was a surprise.

296
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,233
They're drinking a lot of water.

297
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
I told them to cut that out.

298
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:32,600
There are a whole lot of fish sausages
in the refrigerator.

299
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,934
Please lie down here, Jimmy.

300
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:41,000
-So many sausages!
-There are tons of them!

301
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,533
I saw this on a Korean TV show before.

302
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:47,667
Apparently you can fit
about 30 fish sausages in your mouth.

303
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:50,767
Why don't we see who can
put the most in his mouth?

304
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,834
-Like that? Uncooked?
-Like this. As they are.

305
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,800
Let's see who can put the most in.

306
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,533
-One by one?
-It'll make you gag.

307
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,266
-There are so many.
-How many sausages fit?

308
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,667
-Thirty?
-One guy can put 30 in his mouth.

309
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:06,333
-Who wants to try?
-What kind of TV does Korea have?

310
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,967
You should go, Takahashi.
You brought it up.

311
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,266
-You started it.
-Okay. Jimmy and me.

312
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,333
-Takahashi and Jimmy.
-Me?

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,367
We add three each turn?

314
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,367
-Is that how we'll do this?
-One-on-one?

315
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,033
It's not a team game?

316
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,166
Go for it like that.

317
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,600
-Thirty sausages?
-Yes.

318
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,567
-They won't fit.
-You're already full.

319
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:31,467
I think I'll be bad at this.

320
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,900
-You put them in yourself?
-Will you do it?

321
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:36,700
-That would be better.
-You can fit heaps more.

322
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,734
Three at a time, right?

323
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,533
Three shouldn't be a problem.

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,266
Ready for three more?

325
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,433
Three at a time.

326
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,200
We have to push them in.

327
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:50,100
-I don't think they'll make it.
-That's only six.

328
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,667
He's pretty full already.

329
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,367
Takahashi has three?

330
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,133
Kobayashi, give Takahashi three more.

331
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,667
-He's already full.
-What a small mouth.

332
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,266
-I don't think he'll even get to 10.
-That's seven.

333
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,467
Seven.

334
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,900
Jimmy still has space.

335
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,100
A lot of space.

336
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,600
Shigeo doesn't look good.

337
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,767
You're a seven-sausage man.

338
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,066
No, he can fit more.

339
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,967
Are you an eight-sausage man?
An eight-sausage man.

340
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,166
Eight.

341
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,033
Jimmy has heaps of room.

342
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,233
-The eight-sausage man is the problem.
-Shigeo's full.

343
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,667
He can't take any more.

344
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,133
-He'll gag.
-No more.

345
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,533
Are you a nine-sausage man?

346
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,300
Thirty of these?

347
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,200
Jimmy is...

348
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,266
He has plenty of room.

349
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,500
-Here might work.
-Nine-Sausage Man.

350
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,934
It's in. Okay.

351
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,533
Jimmy's ready.

352
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,467
-Ten.
-Ten sausages.

353
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,700
-Jimmy looks comfortable.
-It fits with such ease.

354
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,367
What about Ten-Sausage Man?

355
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,700
Can you make it to Ten-Sausage Man?

356
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,400
No way. He's done for.

357
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,967
This is a good match!

358
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,700
But the goal is 30, right?

359
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,500
He fits them in with such ease.

360
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,166
He must have soft lips.
They slip right in.

361
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:20,467
You're right. But he opened
his mouth really wide earlier.

362
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,066
You're starting to drool, Jimmy.

363
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
-You're drooling.
-Will it fit?

364
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,166
Let's do three sausages at once.

365
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,433
Good idea!

366
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,600
You did it yourself?

367
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,767
I think I'll get Tamura for that.

368
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,100
That was close!

369
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,667
So close!

370
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:59,433
He took out two at once.

371
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,066
Jimmy had me the whole time.

372
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,900
-He was shaking.
-It's him, right?

373
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,667
-It wasn't me. I didn't laugh.
-It was Tamura.

374
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,000
It was Tamura. I had these in my mouth.

375
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,734
My reaction wasn't "laughter."
It was "surprise."

376
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:16,767
Tamura.

377
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:18,734
What? It definitely wasn't me!

378
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,767
-Mr. Matsumoto, please look!
-I was just surprised.

379
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:26,433
The air in the room was virtually
dripping with laughter, but...

380
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,767
-But Tamura deserves a card, I'm afraid.
-So it was Tamura.

381
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:31,834
No way!

382
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,533
-You smiled.
-I did.

383
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,200
Looking at the replay, I see.
But that's out?

384
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,700
-That was out.
-Takahashi doesn't get one?

385
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,700
-But I think Takahashi laughed too.
-It wasn't a laugh.

386
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,266
But his mouth was full,
so it was hard to tell.

387
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,667
I see.

388
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,567
I was just surprised.

389
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,200
I was struggling so much,

390
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,433
but he slipped them in so easily,
and so quickly.

391
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,567
I thought, "Whoa!"

392
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,133
Yeah. I can see I smiled.
I have to be careful.

393
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
And today, if you get hungry,
you can order out.

394
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,533
You can order pizza, sushi, or Chinese...

395
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,667
-If you wish.
-That's dangerous.

396
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:18,834
I'm in trouble!

397
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,500
-I wasn't even aware I was smiling.
-I had no idea it was you.

398
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,867
-I didn't realize until I saw my face.
-You definitely smiled.

399
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,734
Okay, let's go.

400
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,133
-Akiyama's going to try?
-I will.

401
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,100
-How many?
-You can do 10, right?

402
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,333
-How many will you start with?
-Why not 10?

403
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,333
Instead of adding them gradually,
it may be better to go all at once.

404
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,333
Shall we go for 13?

405
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,734
-You should start with 10.
-Okay, 10.

406
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,700
-Here are 10.
-Thanks.

407
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,633
-Put them in, please.
-Oh, that thing.

408
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,400
That's what he wanted to do.

409
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,133
His mouth fits perfectly.

410
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,467
-I've never seen it so close.
-Takahashi.

411
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:15,033
Please open your mouth wider, Mr. Umemiya.

412
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:23,500
If you poke out your tongue,
the sausages won't fit.

413
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,834
I wonder.

414
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,667
Since you like fishing,
do you prefer fish sausages?

415
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:30,467
-I guess so.
-Yes, I do.

416
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,066
-You do?
-Rather than German ones.

417
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,367
-You prefer fish sausages?
-That's right.

418
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,166
If you had to choose,
you'd pick fish sausages?

419
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,266
But you like animal meat too, right?

420
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,600
I love meat too. I still eat steaks.

421
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,033
He keeps coming.

422
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,233
Jinnai, he keeps coming.

423
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,266
Mr. Umemiya, let's go one by one.

424
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,066
-He keeps coming.
-One by one.

425
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:56,967
What a small mouth.

426
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,834
It's smaller than I expected.

427
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,600
There you go.

428
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,200
How many can you take?

429
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:05,400
Go gradually. Let's aim for five or six.

430
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,100
Five... Then I'll put in three.

431
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,100
The older you get, the less you eat.

432
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,734
Don't push yourself too far.

433
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,166
-But you eat meat, right?
-I do eat meat.

434
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,700
-I eat to keep my energy level up.
-Right.

435
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,500
-So I eat meat.
-How much meat do you eat?

436
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:22,467
When I do, I eat about a pound of it.

437
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,100
That's a lot.

438
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,033
Go gradually.

439
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,967
But we've still only got four.

440
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,567
How's that?

441
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,567
-He's reached his limit.
-Maybe.

442
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,600
What's wrong?

443
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,233
Mr. Umemiya!

444
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Mr. Umemiya?

445
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,300
It got in my throat.

446
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,166
It gets in your throat.

447
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,734
That's how it goes.

448
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,166
But you only had four.

449
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:51,367
-He spat it out.
-He can't see?

450
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,233
He can't see, right?

451
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,467
Who cares?

452
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,767
They won't fit.

453
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,333
They won't.

454
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,834
They reach my throat.

455
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,066
Right to my Adam's apple.

456
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,934
-Those look cute.
-What are they?

457
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:09,233
Well, this is a game I found.

458
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,333
"The Ducks' Eyes Light Up."

459
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,533
You pick them up,
and if their eyes light up, you win.

460
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,000
Only two of the four light up.

461
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:19,667
If you guess the exact pair, you win.

462
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,133
They light up when held?

463
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,934
You have to squeeze them. Let me show you.

464
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,467
You chose right.

465
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,633
The mouth lights up.

466
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,433
-The mouth?
-The mouth lights up?

467
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,700
The mouth lights up.
I got the correct pair on the first try.

468
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,433
Who wants to try?

469
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,934
So there are two of each?

470
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,033
Only two of each.

471
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,300
-You got it right on the first try?
-Yes.

472
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,867
Don't watch while I shuffle.

473
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:44,934
Okay.

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Will someone please give it a try?

475
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:48,600
-I'll go.
-Okay.

476
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,533
It can't be that hard.

477
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,266
The chances are 50-50,
but there are a lot possible combinations.

478
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,533
-They both have to light up.
-So what you did was amazing.

479
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,567
-What happened?
-Well...

480
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
Well, they gave me an electric shock.

481
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,400
Takahashi, give it a try.

482
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,200
That was a surprise.

483
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:18,767
-Give it a try.
-Okay.

484
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:21,066
But you got shocked, right?

485
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah, well. I'm not sure.

486
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:25,233
It may have been a bad combination.

487
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,066
-But...
-What's he doing?

488
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,066
He scared me.

489
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,233
Be careful, Golgo!

490
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,400
-What's he doing?
-That's dangerous.

491
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,033
-What's he doing?
-What is it?

492
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,567
-Who's he aiming at?
-Jimmy.

493
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,000
Why is he aiming at me?

494
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,333
Isn't it hot in here?

495
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,667
-You're hot?
-Aren't you hot?

496
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,633
It's so hot.

497
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:55,333
I'm so hot.

498
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:58,300
-What's this?
-You squeeze two at once.

499
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,800
If they light up, you win.

500
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,033
Two of them? How do I do it?

501
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,767
-Choose your ducks.
-Only two of them light up.

502
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,567
The other two don't light up.

503
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,166
-Squeeze them on both sides.
-Both sides?

504
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,600
-Choose your ducks.
-Pick them up.

505
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
-I pick them up by the metal part?
-Yeah.

506
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,633
If they light up, you win.

507
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,000
Ouch!

508
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,600
Ouch!

509
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,600
Ouch!

510
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
I can't let go!

511
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:23,600
Ouch!

512
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,333
Ouch!

513
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,200
That's not what I expected.

514
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,767
-What's this?
-He's doing something.

515
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,567
-What's up?
-Do they all shock you?

516
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:40,467
What's wrong?

517
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,667
What?

518
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,800
What?

519
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,767
Thank you

520
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,066
very much!

521
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,000
-Do they all give a shock?
-Sorry.

522
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,800
All of them shock you, right?

523
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:01,033
All of them? Were you just enduring it?

524
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,900
All of them lit up.

525
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:06,200
Aren't they shocking you?

526
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,333
What's going on?

527
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,734
Shigeo, give it a try.

528
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,967
Maybe they don't shock individually.

529
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,600
Let go of it.

530
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:14,633
Here you go.

531
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
This is scary.

532
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,166
It's scary once you know.

533
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,400
That was strong!

534
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:26,967
Are you really fine?

535
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,500
You're scary.

536
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,166
For real?

537
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:31,900
I guess some freaks can do it.

538
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,600
How do you handle
low-frequency therapy devices?

539
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,000
-I'm fine.
-Totally?

540
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:38,834
-If this doesn't hurt, they won't either.
-Right.

541
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,767
I can even hold all four.

542
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,266
-That's too much.
-Don't do it.

543
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
-Wow.
-You're totally fine with it?

544
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:50,100
Are you just tolerating it?
Is it tingling? Now?

545
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,567
I can feel it tingling.

546
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:54,667
It may look small,
but it's one of the strongest there is.

547
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:57,367
It's strong.
It's enough to make your legs give way.

548
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,567
It gives a shock
when you hold two at once?

549
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,633
That's right.

550
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:03,367
-This is scary. You squeeze both of them?
-Yes.

551
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,567
We told you that would happen.

552
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,333
What's wrong?

553
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:24,600
What's that sound?

554
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,767
What is it?

555
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,934
-Kobayashi...
-Something is whirring.

556
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,166
What is it?

557
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,233
What?

558
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,200
-I hear a whirring sound.
-I hear it.

559
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,400
It's not the birds.

560
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,266
They made something start whirring.

561
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,000
It can't be the birds.
They just give you a shock.

562
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,000
There's a whirring sound.

563
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,200
You hear that?

564
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,400
I had a pink vibrator in here.

565
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,133
How could you...

566
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,800
-That's dangerous.
-Which shocked you?

567
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,800
-Which gave the shock?
-The pink one?

568
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,834
-Squeezing them turned this on.
-How?

569
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,433
-How does that work?
-Wow!

570
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,233
Why don't you turn it off and...

571
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,400
-Who are you?
-What is it?

572
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,367
I was wondering what's up.

573
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,800
Who are you?

574
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:07,900
Me?

575
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,133
Talking to me?

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
I'm Sato Mascar...

577
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,300
Yojiro.

578
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,066
Sato Mascar Yojiro.

579
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,433
I'm half Japanese.

580
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm half Japanese.

581
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,500
-Sato?
-Yes. Mascar Yojiro.

582
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,600
-Mascar?
-Yes.

583
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,266
Where are your parents from?

584
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,467
England and...

585
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,233
Canada.

586
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,800
-What's with the glasses?
-What about Japan?

587
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,333
Your chin is wet.

588
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,633
Well...

589
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,767
I ran here.

590
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,467
What were you were doing?

591
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,633
I squeezed them and ended up like this.

592
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,667
Try squeezing two of them.

593
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,333
-These?
-Squeeze their sides.

594
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:47,767
-Here?
-Yes.

595
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,133
-Both of them?
-Squeeze hard.

596
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,033
Ouch!

597
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,633
Give me a break.

598
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,066
-What?
-His eyes are blue.

599
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,867
-Are they colored contacts?
-I'm half Japanese.

600
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,100
They're colored contacts.

601
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,800
Couldn't you find contacts
with more color?

602
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,100
It's hard to tell.

603
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:10,266
-Are we supposed to laugh?
-Who'd laugh?

604
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:13,033
-I'm half Japanese.
-That was the setup?

605
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,200
So your eyes are blue?

606
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,967
Where are your parents from again?

607
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,367
Um, Itaba...

608
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,600
-England and Canada.
-You said Itabashi.

609
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,467
You came from Itabashi, right?

610
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:24,800
I'll go.

611
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:26,533
You're leaving?

612
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,567
Already?

613
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,800
Is that all?

614
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,033
What do you do?

615
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,066
For a living?

616
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,400
Um...

617
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,000
I work at Tokyo Station.

618
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,967
At a souvenir shop.

619
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,333
What do you sell?

620
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,367
Chicks.

621
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,367
-You sell these?
-Yes. I feel at home.

622
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:45,600
-You sell these?
-Yes.

623
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,867
-You sell these at Tokyo Station?
-You do?

624
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,967
They're a new series that just came out.

625
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,200
-From Hiyoko Sweets?
-We sell them there.

626
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:53,567
They're from that store?

627
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,667
-What else do you sell?
-Chick Shock, Chick Sweets,

628
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,200
Chick Magnets,

629
00:29:58,266 --> 00:29:59,767
Chick Pas...

630
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:00,767
Chick Pasta.

631
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:01,800
Chick Pasta?

632
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,500
-What's in it?
-Chicks.

633
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:06,533
-Chicks?
-You mean chick meat?

634
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:10,000
If you're ever nearby,
please come to level B1.

635
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,166
What's on B1?

636
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,166
Bullet train tracks.

637
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:16,066
-The bullet train?
-Trains run there.

638
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:17,467
Please stop by.

639
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:18,467
Okay.

640
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,567
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

641
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,300
He was half Japanese.

642
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:24,867
He's brave.

643
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:27,266
He couldn't find contacts
with a deeper color.

644
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,000
-It was hard to tell.
-It was.

645
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,000
He's 0% Japanese.

646
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:32,500
-Do you want to play cards?
-Good idea.

647
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,467
I'll play cards.

648
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:35,834
Cards.

649
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,500
-What game?
-Well...

650
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,867
-What are we playing?
-How about poker? Wanna play poker?

651
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:43,033
Can this many people play poker?

652
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,166
Okay then, let's play President.

653
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,700
Okay, teach us the rules.
Just to make sure.

654
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,100
-You know the rules of President.
-I do.

655
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,700
The cards slide so smoothly.

656
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,033
He's like a real dealer.

657
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,266
-Jimmy, do you know President?
-I do.

658
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,700
Is this mine?

659
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,700
Twos are the strongest.
Threes are the weakest.

660
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:07,834
If someone plays a pair, you have to
play a pair with a higher number.

661
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,433
One for you... That's all.

662
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:12,033
We have to play all our cards?

663
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,533
-That's right.
-We just...

664
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,367
We play our cards, right?

665
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,867
I have more cards to start off with.

666
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:19,400
Give some to me.

667
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,367
You told me to deal two at a time.

668
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:25,233
-These cards are a bit unusual.
-Give one back.

669
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,700
I have three...

670
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,834
What happened?

671
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,266
What was that?

672
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
-What? Why?
-What did you laugh at?

673
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,133
He's laughing hard.

674
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,834
-What got you?
-What made you laugh?

675
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
No.

676
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:46,767
It was Junior...

677
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,667
Junior wrote this and showed it to me.
Just for me.

678
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,166
"Ichiro."

679
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,233
ICHIRO

680
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,734
You must really like Ichiro.

681
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,834
-What a way to go.
-That scared me.

682
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,200
I couldn't see what happened on our side.

683
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,133
It was that.

684
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
He wrote "Ichiro."

685
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,800
What's so funny?

686
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,000
How is that funny?

687
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,667
No, it's just that I've been
hooked on Ichiro the whole time.

688
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:11,734
I mean...

689
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,266
I never expected him to write "Ichiro."

690
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,467
Yellow.

691
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,300
I have no excuse.

692
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,400
Wait. It's not yellow.

693
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,066
-Orange.
-It's orange.

694
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:25,667
But I haven't done...

695
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,133
Want to see?

696
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,400
-I had no idea he'd do this.
-Okay, let's take a look.

697
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,467
-That was so sudden.
-I never thought he'd do that.

698
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,834
That pretty much goes for everything.

699
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,133
That's one of the fundamentals of comedy.

700
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,333
I mean, I never guessed
he'd write the same name.

701
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
But he kept going for it.

702
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,700
Like I said,
that's a fundamental of comedy.

703
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,100
"Doing the unexpected."
That's what's funny, right?

704
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,934
You told me to deal two at a time.

705
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,367
-These cards are a bit unusual.
-Give one back.

706
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,834
I have three...

707
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,233
He's totally laughing.

708
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Totally laughing.

709
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,200
He's laughing, no doubt.

710
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:11,967
I couldn't help it.
After all, I never expected it.

711
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,967
Even if that is a fundamental...

712
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,467
-"Ichiro."
-You're all doing well.

713
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:21,834
You're holding back your laughter,
but still making it funny as a whole.

714
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,500
-You are.
-Thanks.

715
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,467
I wonder who put this here.

716
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:29,633
You are scary.

717
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,066
Here, of all places.

718
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,633
Seriously.

719
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,633
You are so nasty. I did nothing to you.

720
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,834
No way. That's definitely going to get me.

721
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,834
-You have no more chances.
-You can't do this to me!

722
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,967
You're setting me up to fail!

723
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,333
I'm not, honestly.

724
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,867
I'm really not.

725
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,367
That egg is of no importance.

726
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:59,033
You've got cards.

727
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:02,233
-Can we look at the cards now?
-Go for it.

728
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,533
Well, we've had some interruptions.

729
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,500
-There's one left.
-I know.

730
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,266
-Jimmy starts.
-He won't last.

731
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,200
-One more card.
-Pick up your card.

732
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,633
Jimmy won't make it.

733
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:14,033
It's like he's sprained both ankles.

734
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,300
It's hard to tell which cards are strong.

735
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:18,200
Try looking at the egg once more.

736
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,100
Once more.

737
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,500
-The egg.
-I will.

738
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,967
I wonder who put it there.

739
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,233
Kobayashi did.

740
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,433
Not "Ichiro"?

741
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:33,533
You know...

742
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:36,500
He said one look was enough.

743
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:38,500
I looked.

744
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,667
-One more time.
-I did.

745
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,600
-One more time?
-I already did.

746
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,367
-One more time.
-I did.

747
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,000
One last time. Please.

748
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,467
Okay, I'll look.

749
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,000
-Okay?
-It's just an ordinary egg.

750
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:55,900
It's just an egg.

751
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,767
For real?

752
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,233
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

753
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Wait!

754
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,400
I haven't done any of my bits.

755
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,800
You can't do that!

756
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,867
-What was that?
-What was it?

757
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,333
You guys can't do that!

758
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,900
Who would've guessed
the egg would get him?

759
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,934
-You laughed out loud.
-It was there from the start.

760
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,867
No way!
I told you to stop talking about the egg!

761
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,767
What's funny about that egg?

762
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,600
It hit my funny bone!

763
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,500
-It's not funny at all!
-Not at all!

764
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,266
-It's just a plain egg, sitting there.
-No, it's not.

765
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,600
Usually when you put something
on a scale, it tips to one side,

766
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:41,266
-but this one stays flat.
-It's not a scale.

767
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,500
It's a candle holder.

768
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,066
It's a candle holder?

769
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:46,734
That's what got you?

770
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,166
He thought it was a scale!

771
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:51,900
I couldn't figure out why it didn't tip.
I was thinking, "That's wrong."

772
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:54,734
-"What's with this egg?"
-You made it funny yourself.

773
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,667
You thought, "What a light egg!"?

774
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,533
"What a light egg!"

775
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,400
That would be funny.

776
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:02,066
That kept nagging me.

777
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,400
This is unbelievable!

778
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:05,734
You are unbelievable.

779
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:12,600
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I haven't done anything yet.

780
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,333
You laughed so hard!

781
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,600
-I've done nothing.
-You laughed hard.

782
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,700
-He laughed without even looking at it.
-No way.

783
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,633
-He didn't look?
-Not at the end.

784
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,567
-But I was...
-Imagining was enough.

785
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,033
-One more time.
-I did.

786
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:32,967
-One more time?
-I already did.

787
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,934
-One more time.
-Okay, I'll look.

788
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,600
-Okay?
-It's just an ordinary egg.

789
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,567
It's just an egg.

790
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,300
-You totally laughed.
-What's so funny?

791
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,433
Why couldn't you hold it in?

792
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,367
I brought so many things to do.

793
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,367
For nothing.

794
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:54,934
-But you can be a zombie.
-Okay, I'll be a zombie.

795
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,900
-Take 'em all down.
-He'll get us all.

796
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,967
-Zombies can laugh all they want.
-He'll be a scary zombie.

797
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,200
You're right. He will make a scary zombie.

798
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,433
A scary zombie indeed!

799
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,433
-He brought such a big bag.
-You all play dirty!

800
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,600
They did team up on you a bit.

801
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,266
No doubt... You, too!

802
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,266
But you were too easy to take down.

803
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,400
-You were so easy.
-For real? I was too easy?

804
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,867
It's a big bag,
but there's nothing inside.

805
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,300
It's virtually empty.

806
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:21,900
So, he's leaving.

807
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,433
-What the hell?
-Good try.

808
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,900
Go to the Zombie Room.

809
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,166
-"Ichiro" and an egg.
-That was fast.

810
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,133
I didn't do a single thing.

811
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
Junior and the other guys...
They use skills.

812
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:38,600
They kept going on the attack,
so I thought,

813
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,233
"I have to stay clear of them."

814
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,200
The plan was to bide my time,

815
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:46,033
and make sure I didn't laugh
in the meantime,

816
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:48,567
but they beat me, and now...

817
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,333
I'm disappointed, but...

818
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,100
The fact I'm so weak is...

819
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,433
It's like...

820
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,066
I mean...

821
00:37:58,533 --> 00:37:59,767
Well...

822
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:03,900
It's...

823
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:21,033
Happy New Year.

824
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,900
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

825
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,133
Happy New Year.
