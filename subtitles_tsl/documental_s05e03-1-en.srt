00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:18,266
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:22,433
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,567
Of course, they'll come with game plans.

4
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:30,633
But things don't always go as planned.
That's how it is on Documental.

5
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,800
Was I laughing?

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,900
When you look at a comedian's
offensive and defensive strengths,

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,100
I think you can see a strong correlation.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,700
The funnier they are,
the easier they laugh.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,300
Come up with one already!

10
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,567
I'm sure they'll bring ammunition,

11
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:57,100
but choosing when to use it
is another thing.

12
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,834
How much do you use at the start?

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,667
What if you wait for the right moment,
but it ends before you shoot?

14
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:06,767
Not like you have a machine gun
with an unlimited number of bullets.

15
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,800
It's about how you use your ammo.

16
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,633
And there's also the question
of who you target.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,734
Choge choge passion

18
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,033
"A gum-like substance came out."

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,867
CONTESTANTS ELIMINATED SO FAR:
JIMMY ONISHI

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,834
-These cards are a bit unusual.
-Give one back.

21
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,133
I have three...

22
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:53,233
Tamura.

23
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,533
What? It definitely wasn't me!

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,967
Okay, I'll look.

25
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:01,100
-Okay?
-It's just an ordinary egg.

26
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,567
It's just an egg.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,266
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I haven't done anything yet.

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Here we go.

29
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,433
Shall I do "PPAP"?

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,133
An over-exaggerated "PPAP." Shall I?

31
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
-Go for it!
-Here I go!

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,200
How does the regular version go?

33
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,367
The regular one. The regular one...

34
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,633
I have a urethra

35
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,300
Urethra pen

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I have an anus

37
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,333
Anal pen!

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,033
Urethra pen!

39
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,934
Anal pen!

40
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,400
Pen urethra anal pen!

41
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,200
Pen urethra anal pen!

42
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,066
How was that?

43
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,300
That's nothing like the original.

44
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:31,667
That was funny.

45
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,867
The pen doesn't go into the urethra.

46
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,400
Really? That wasn't it?

47
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,333
When you said "urethra"
you pointed at your anus.

48
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,633
You said it so cool. "Urethra."

49
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,333
I didn't say it like that.

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,500
You said it like you were so hot.

51
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,000
"Urethra."

52
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,266
That's not how I said it.

53
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,667
Right, Kano?

54
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,066
How did he say it?

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
"Don't use the urethra, dude."

56
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,800
I didn't end in "dude."

57
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,233
I never say "dude."

58
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,767
Junior...

59
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,934
What's this?

60
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,166
What?

61
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,100
What?

62
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,967
-He's making quite a face, isn't he?
-He is.

63
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,333
-Do "Perfect Human" for us.
-"Perfect Human"?

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,500
Enough already!

65
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,433
-Get close to him.
-Hey.

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,700
Junior is really on the ropes.

67
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,734
-Please watch him.
-Leave me alone.

68
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,867
Na, ka, ta. Nakata
Na, ka, ta. Nakata

69
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,900
Na, ka, ta. Nakata...

70
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,734
I'm a per...

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,133
I'm a perfect human

72
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,633
We live in Tokyo

73
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,800
Na, ka, ta. Nakata

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm a perfect...

75
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:50,767
human!

76
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,133
Good, good. He held out.

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,567
-Can you impersonate anyone?
-I can do Viking's Nishimura.

78
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,800
-Without exaggerating.
-Then do that.

79
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,467
Viking's Nishimura?

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,567
Coming back to school after so many years
sure brings back memories.

81
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,500
Nothing has changed.
It sure brings back memories.

82
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,667
Is Mr. Kotouge still here?

83
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:15,133
It's me! Nishimura! Nothing has changed!

84
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,800
You sounded just like him.

85
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,133
I can do Kotouge too.

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,867
You can? Really?

87
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:23,567
Teacher, I'm Nishimura. Remember me?

88
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,200
No, I don't.

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm Nishimura. Don't you remember me?

90
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:33,233
I don't remember you.

91
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,000
Like that.

92
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,700
You're good at impressions.

93
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,000
I am good.

94
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,066
Otoko-ume?

95
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,166
Otoko-ume.

96
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,567
-Good impression.
-Your other one is better.

97
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:51,834
Zakoshi is amazing.

98
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,800
-Which one?
-Fist of the North Star.

99
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,033
The Famicom game Fist of the North Star.

100
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,767
There's a scene where he goes back
into the cave.

101
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
From the video game.

102
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,500
He went back.

103
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,734
Good thing I never saw the original.

104
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,166
He really hits the spot.

105
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,033
I'm defenseless against Zakoshi.

106
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,734
Who's this?

107
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,567
Last year, in the Kansai region alone,

108
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:28,033
I filmed TV shows
at more than 300 locations.

109
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,433
I did many at osteopathic
and chiropractic clinics.

110
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,166
I learned how to check how likely
people are to get a bunion.

111
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,767
Please, Jinnai.

112
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,500
Me? Sure, check me out.

113
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:39,967
-Bunions?
-You can tell?

114
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,900
If you get a bunion,
it can lead to an ingrown toenail.

115
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:47,100
That causes problems with how you walk,
and affects your total health.

116
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,533
I just need one foot.

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,033
Does it affect men, too?

118
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,233
Men can get it too.

119
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,367
Many men visit clinics
with this condition.

120
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,100
Put your right foot up here.

121
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,600
What can you find out?

122
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,300
Whether you're in danger
of getting a bunion.

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,467
All right.

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,133
Is Jinnai losing it?

125
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,000
He just scored a very high point.

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,633
You can't do that!

127
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,633
-That was the same as tickling.
-Yeah. You tickled me!

128
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,133
-No, it wasn't tickling.
-Is that allowed?

129
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,633
Wait a minute!

130
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,800
That was the same as tickling!

131
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,967
It was different from tickling.

132
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,333
Mr. Matsumoto, that was just tickling!

133
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,567
Well, I think
Yamauchi scored a huge point.

134
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,233
It was the same as tickling!

135
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,333
I think it was more about
"betraying expectations."

136
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,333
Now wait just a minute.

137
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,233
That was not fair.

138
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,066
It's impossible not to laugh.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
He was licking all over...

140
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,867
You're kidding me, right?

141
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,033
Wait.

142
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,333
That's not right!

143
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,166
I laughed my head off,
but I couldn't help it!

144
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,967
-You're kidding me. Not yet.
-You laughed out loud.

145
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,133
-Not that! Not yet!
-Let's watch it.

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,567
-That was...
-Let me look. But I'm not sure.

147
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,600
-He tickled me!
-You laughed hard.

148
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,166
Was that just a yellow?

149
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,033
Having that done to you
would make anyone laugh!

150
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,300
Whether you're in danger
of getting a bunion.

151
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,367
All right.

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,667
There.

153
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,100
He was licking me.

154
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,767
He was pretty much smiling there already.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,033
But that was tickling!

156
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,934
Tickling wasn't the objective.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,233
-His tongue went crazy.
-He made him laugh.

158
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,600
-It wasn't tickling.
-It was the situation.

159
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,567
He was licking between my toes.

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
Oh, please.

161
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,400
He's getting one.

162
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,266
That's harsh.

163
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,200
That hurts.

164
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,934
You laughed.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,033
I laughed?

166
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,767
I wouldn't say I laughed...

167
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:59,633
And afterwards you did this.
I didn't like that either.

168
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,633
But...

169
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,100
I didn't like the way you tried to hide.

170
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,567
Anyway, Yamauchi scored a big point there.

171
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,200
-I thought so.
-Thank you.

172
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,734
Let's go.

173
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,166
-I don't need a checkup.
-I'm okay.

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,533
-I'm okay, too.
-Tamura?

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,767
I already had surgery to fix
my ingrown toenail. I'm okay.

176
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,700
-You should check Jinnai's left foot, too.
-No. I'm fine.

177
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,433
I don't care if I get a bunion.

178
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,266
Takahashi,
your posture is raising a red flag.

179
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,567
You're right.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,500
Let him check your left foot.

181
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,000
Doing the same thing to two people
is wrong.

182
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,100
I wouldn't say it's wrong.

183
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,133
You should let me check, just in case.

184
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,533
-Make him the last.
-But you know what he'll do.

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,900
So you'll be fine.

186
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,667
-I didn't know.
-Good point.

187
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:53,934
-Let me have a look. Before it's too late.
-If you didn't know, you'd probably laugh.

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,333
Yamauchi is serious.

189
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,033
He's serious.

190
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,467
Please. Either foot will do.

191
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,700
Your dominant one might be better.

192
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:07,834
-This is really...
-How does he do that?

193
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,233
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

194
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,033
I don't like this kind of...

195
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:24,800
Wow. How can they not laugh?

196
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,066
-This doesn't look good.
-What?

197
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,700
You're fine.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
-He needs to lick that much?
-You really lick all over.

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,700
-That much?
-I was a bit worried at first.

200
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,133
Wow.

201
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,533
Sorry about that.

202
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,200
You're completely fine.

203
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,333
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,266
Yamauchi is amazing.

205
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,100
-What's wrong?
-My shoulder.

206
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,967
-It hurts?
-He had to fight it.

207
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,734
-It hurts.
-Are you okay?

208
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,567
-Huh?
-Huh?

209
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,800
-Maybe your other foot is causing it.
-It comes diagonally.

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,834
Let him check your left foot, too.

211
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,433
Just to make sure.

212
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:22,433
I don't think you'll find anything
in my garden.

213
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,200
-Let me check.
-He swallowed the foot whole.

214
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,867
That was poetic.

215
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,133
What?

216
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,633
How is it?

217
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,967
How is it, Doc?

218
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,633
Wait a minute.

219
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,967
And lastly...

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,767
-No way. What was that?
-I nearly lost it.

221
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,633
You can't do that.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Well...

223
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,667
Yamauchi was amazing.

224
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,066
That was too much.

225
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,700
Yeah, that was too much.

226
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,533
-It was a fierce battle.
-How do you all hold it in?

227
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,433
It wasn't just tickling.

228
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,367
He was trying to make me come.

229
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,867
-It was foreplay.
-That was amazing.

230
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:20,367
-After considering a number of things...
-What?

231
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,333
How is it, Doc?

232
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:27,867
Wait a minute.

233
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,300
And lastly...

234
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,233
-That did deserve a yellow.
-That's harsh.

235
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,867
I think Jinnai laughed, too.

236
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,266
-No, I didn't.
-He did.

237
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,000
No, I didn't. Are you serious?

238
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,567
Getting a red card like this
would be so wrong.

239
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,934
-Let's go.
-What's that?

240
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,000
-It's a tag.
-What does it say?

241
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:56,934
What is it?

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,900
"Yamauchi [Kamaitachi]
Chiropractor Costume Set."

243
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,900
Take it off.

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,567
So you borrowed it?

245
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:13,667
Who are you?

246
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:17,867
It's hot!

247
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,033
It's hot!

248
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,800
It was "Mister It's Hot."

249
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,233
You know him?

250
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,567
Zakoshisyoh keeps coming.

251
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:34,834
What's that?

252
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,433
I'm hooked on Instagram.

253
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,767
-You take photos with that?
-You can't.

254
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:41,800
-You can't post photos with that.
-Why not use a smartphone?

255
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:45,333
-This takes photos with character.
-So you develop the photos,

256
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,667
-then you shoot them with your phone?
-I upload them to PC.

257
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,233
-Do you take Instagram-worthy photos?
-Yes.

258
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,734
-What kind of photos?
-I post people, too.

259
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,834
May I? It's a great chance.

260
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,433
May I take you, Tamura?

261
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,867
Can you... That's good.

262
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,667
Please pose for the photo.

263
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,967
-Will "Cha!" do?
-That would be great!

264
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,233
Okay. Here we go.

265
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,867
Ready. Say cheese.

266
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,367
Okay!

267
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,166
Great. Can I have one more?

268
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:17,500
Can you take one step back?

269
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,033
Great. Say cheese.

270
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,500
Okay!

271
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,467
-You took yourself.
-I've seen him do that before.

272
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,767
-At a paid gig?
-It's part of his set.

273
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,100
-At an Aeon Mall.
-I've seen it, too.

274
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,133
-Right.
-I saw you do it at Aeon.

275
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Do audiences laugh at that?

276
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,266
They do.

277
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,133
Sorry about my reaction.

278
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,066
I look up when I do "Cha!"
so I couldn't see you.

279
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,033
Hey there.

280
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,266
-He's short.
-So short.

281
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,233
Mr. Umemiya, you're so short.

282
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,266
Aren't you kind of short?

283
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:51,033
He's about 4'5".

284
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,433
I shrank.

285
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,734
Hey there.

286
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,633
Can people shrink that much?

287
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,867
He tap dances?

288
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,500
You're light-footed.

289
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,400
So light-footed.

290
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,066
With your hands in your pockets.

291
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:15,033
Do you think there's a chance
Mr. Umemiya might get a bunion?

292
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,533
He is so annoying.

293
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,600
So annoying.

294
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:32,266
Junior's defense is really weak
when it comes to Zakoshi.

295
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:37,133
-Is that the Sayama version of Tiger Mask?
-Yes.

296
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,600
It's his "Tiger Step."

297
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,600
He takes great care with his "Tiger Step"
when he passes that area.

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,533
He gets super careful there.

299
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,700
-I wonder why.
-Because there's delicate equipment there.

300
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,834
Because of the delicate equipment,
and because Junior's standing there.

301
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,166
He's super careful with his superiors.

302
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,133
What is he actually doing?

303
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,500
-He's such a straight guy.
-What's he doing?

304
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,767
He attaches his mic properly
even when he won't speak.

305
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,100
He's coming at me.

306
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:39,033
-He's so close.
-He only breathes through his nose.

307
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,467
I don't like this.

308
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,166
Only through his nose.

309
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,400
I think...

310
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,166
-Too close.
-He's onto you.

311
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm fine, thanks.

312
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,900
Can you do a sobat kick?
I want to see one.

313
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,800
You kicked me.

314
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,633
It didn't hurt at all.

315
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,000
What a small kick and low jump.

316
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:04,800
So low.

317
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,500
He's still using his nose.

318
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,367
Only his nose, the whole time.

319
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:11,700
His mouth's shut.

320
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,367
He won't open his mouth.

321
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,200
See, he's nasal breathing.
Even though he moves so much.

322
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,233
It's really deep nasal breathing.

323
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,033
-He took a break.
-He's tired.

324
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:30,967
-But I don't know him.
-Me neither.

325
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,767
I don't know anything about Satoru Sayama.

326
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,633
I wonder what's under the mask.

327
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
Shall we rip it off?

328
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,367
Yeah, tear it off like
Kuniaki Kobayashi did.

329
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:58,867
It was just Sayama.

330
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:05,867
Ouch.

331
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,066
Ouch.

332
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,700
He's saying, "Ouch."

333
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,667
Takahashi! Takahashi!

334
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,767
You can have your mask back, Sayama.

335
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,767
Ouch, ouch.

336
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,100
Tamura, lie on the table.

337
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,800
Weren't you trying to do that to Jimmy?

338
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,266
No, no. You see...

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,934
-What do you want me to do?
-Put your head down here.

340
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,200
Like this?

341
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:35,133
You can still hear him breathing hard.

342
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,300
-Oh, it's oxygen?
-What's this?

343
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:38,800
Relax.

344
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,967
-I'm not sure what will happen.
-Okay.

345
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,567
It's Isojin, the medical gargle.

346
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,734
It didn't hurt at all?

347
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
It hurt a little.

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
Are you completely relaxed?

349
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,867
I am. Yes.

350
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,667
Maybe he's waiting for it.

351
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,300
-It's better if he doesn't expect it.
-Just relax completely?

352
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,133
Maybe the table's too soft to hurt.

353
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,100
-Maybe.
-Maybe it's too low.

354
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,867
I felt that in my nose.

355
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,533
That hurt my nose.

356
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,433
You recorded the whole thing?

357
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,967
What are you doing?

358
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:54,166
What was that?

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,467
I broke an egg.

360
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:02,166
My head was getting heavy,
so I put it down, but I broke an egg.

361
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,767
Oh, my.

362
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,834
Firstly, it was moved here.

363
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,100
Then it came over here.

364
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:13,734
Wow.

365
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:15,967
Is it my fault?

366
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,467
Was it me?

367
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,734
-Let's wipe it up.
-I guess we should clean this up.

368
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,967
Was it my fault?

369
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,433
Was it me?

370
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,433
Want to play "The Masters Card Game"?

371
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,967
-What's that?
-Sounds fun.

372
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:44,400
We have to say a phrase the masters
have said, or are likely to say.

373
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:48,333
When I flip the card,
whoever touches it first says the phrase.

374
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,500
-A sort of oogiri game.
-Do we start now?

375
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,066
Sure.

376
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,700
"I just blew my load!"

377
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,400
"Get undressed, Helen!"

378
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:19,200
"I only came in because nobody was here."

379
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,567
"Louis XIV, are you open today?"

380
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,233
What's that? A shop?

381
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,400
-His friend.
-His friend?

382
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:36,667
He asked Louis XIV his plans for the day.

383
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,967
The real Louis XIV? The actual guy?

384
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,200
Yes.

385
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:45,367
"My, my. Is this sweet Ruriko?"

386
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,633
You can't say that.

387
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,567
It's a banned phrase?

388
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,633
Why?

389
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:53,200
I think we're trying to avoid
the "My, my" bit.

390
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:55,767
Time for the next one?

391
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:57,166
-Yeah.
-Next.

392
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:00,900
-What's that?
-It must start with "O."

393
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,567
"Okay!"

394
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,767
"Outside there are too many parked cars!"

395
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,200
"Oversized vehicles, I love 'em."

396
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:34,800
He got me.

397
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:36,767
Who was that?

398
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,266
-Kano?
-What was that?

399
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:41,767
I didn't see it.

400
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,667
Kano?

401
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,233
Junior only just held on.

402
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,400
You were close.

403
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,700
I was.

404
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,667
He laughed first.

405
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:51,834
So close.

406
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,900
I wasn't able to see it clearly.

407
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,266
He clearly laughed.

408
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,066
-Didn't I hold it in?
-You laughed.

409
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,567
We could hear you laugh.

410
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:02,633
Let's look at his face.
I couldn't see it clearly.

411
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:06,834
The color of the card will change
depending on how hard you laughed.

412
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,800
He got me.

413
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,767
What was that?

414
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,567
He laughed like some
rich housewife in Shirokane.

415
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,200
Because they locked eyes.

416
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:24,867
Well, that deserves

417
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,133
an orange!

418
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah, an orange.

419
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,266
-That was a big one.
-How harsh!

420
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,500
Keep up the good work.

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,433
If you get hungry,
you can always order out.

422
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
I am hungry.

423
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,266
-How about sushi?
-From the fridge?

424
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,934
-Let's order it.
-Over there?

425
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,834
-Sushi is the easiest to eat.
-Yeah. I want sushi.

426
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,533
-Sushi sounds great.
-Finger food is better.

427
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:48,333
-They have so many varieties.
-They do!

428
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,633
Let's continue.

429
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,600
Order an assorted sushi platter.

430
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,633
How about this?
The 9,000 yen "Mutsuki" set.

431
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:57,633
Let's have that.

432
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,367
-Shall I call?
-Yeah, call them.

433
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,934
Nothing else?

434
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,800
Mommy?

435
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:04,900
Mommy?

436
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,667
Mommy, Mommy?

437
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,266
Mommy.

438
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,066
I did.

439
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:15,400
I truly loved Eiichiro Funakoshi!

440
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,166
Just order the Mutsuki set.

441
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,767
I thought I'd be with Eiichiro Funakoshi
until the day I died!

442
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,233
Leave her out of this.

443
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,934
But!

444
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:27,767
Eiichiro Funakoshi betrayed me!

445
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,400
He uses Viagra!

446
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,700
He has a penis sticker!

447
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,367
-It's Ms. Matsui.
-Kazuyo Matsui.

448
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,934
-Ms. Matsui, can you place our order?
-Sure.

449
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,200
-We'd like some sushi.
-Sushi? Okay.

450
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,200
-You're actually dialing.
-Yeah.

451
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,667
-What do I say?
-Mutsuki--

452
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:50,333
-Hello, this is Koi Sushi.
-Er, Mutsuki?

453
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,600
-Mutsuki?
-Yes. Two sets.

454
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,900
-Two?
-Thank you.

455
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,433
-Two 9,000-yen assorted sushi plates?
-Yes.

456
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,033
-Mommy--
-What is your address?

457
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
What? The address? The address is...

458
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,934
-Kinuta Studio.
-Kinuta Studio.

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Studio L1.

460
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,533
-L1?
-Yes.

461
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay. May I have your name please?

462
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,500
It's Mommy.

463
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,934
Mommy.

464
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:12,300
-Mom...
-Mommy.

465
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,033
-Sorry?
-Mommy.

466
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,066
Mr. Mommy?

467
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,467
Yes, Mommy.

468
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,133
Mommy.

469
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,867
-Got it.
-Mommy, Mommy.

470
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,500
-Okay.
-Mommy.

471
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:26,633
-To L1 Studio.
-Yes, please. Mommy--

472
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,867
Okay. Thank you very much.

473
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,100
Thank you, Mommy--

474
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,567
Sure. Thank you.

475
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,367
Mommy, Mommy.

476
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,266
Zakoshi is dangerous.

477
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,600
-That ended up like a prank call.
-Yeah.

478
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,967
No, no. She got the order. It will come.

479
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,533
Shall we play?

480
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,900
-Let's continue.
-Really?

481
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,867
Why not? Just until the food arrives.

482
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,533
-It'll take a while.
-Here goes.

483
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,834
-My turn?
-Kanpei really took me under his wing.

484
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,700
I think Kanpei's
a hard one to have fun with.

485
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,600
-He says crazy things as it is.
-Exactly.

486
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:00,867
You're right.

487
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,266
"Turn me upside down."

488
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,867
He says that.

489
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
"You were saying something a while ago.
What was it?"

490
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,667
"You were saying something."

491
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,200
"What did you say a while ago.?"

492
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:20,100
"You were saying something."

493
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,433
"You were saying something a while ago."

494
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,900
"You were saying something a while ago."

495
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,200
"Somebody's Night"

496
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,633
Eikoh, just blurt something out.

497
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,066
-Next card.
-It's a speed thing?

498
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,233
Okay.

499
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,033
"Don't put your arms...

500
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,367
around my waist."

501
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,333
That was a tough one.

502
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:04,233
That laugh came from someone
we didn't expect.

503
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,800
-It was a surprise.
-It knocked him flying.

504
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,667
Yamauchi is so tough.

505
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,233
I thought, "Is that the image he evokes?"

506
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,233
Because Eikoh doesn't know him.

507
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,834
Eikoh doesn't know much about
Master Kinshi.

508
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,467
That was really unexpected.

509
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:18,734
Akiyama.

510
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,266
Of course.

511
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,567
Let's take a look.

512
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,166
"Don't put your arms...

513
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,533
around my waist."

514
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,567
-Why?
-Exactly.

515
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,667
It started kicking in afterwards.

516
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:41,200
-I thought, "What on earth is he saying?"
-It wasn't funny at all.

517
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,066
I don't think it's funny myself.

518
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,834
What color should I make it?

519
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,533
He laughed pretty hard.

520
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,066
Yeah, he did laugh hard.

521
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,433
-He laughed out loud.
-It was pretty hard.

522
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,133
-That's harsh.
-Really?

523
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
Laughing out loud was a big factor.

524
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,266
-That's harsh.
-Many of us are on our last life now.

525
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,166
Let's go.

526
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:13,600
So far, I'd say Yamauchi is doing
quite well.

527
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:17,633
He's scored a lot of points
and he has no cards.

528
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,400
I think that's remarkable.

529
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,734
And Zakoshi is doing a great job.

530
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,567
This time Kobayashi is putting up
a good fight, too.

531
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,100
He has no cards either.

532
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,000
-Do you want to play a game?
-What?

533
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,667
-A game.
-You have one?

534
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
What kind of game?

535
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
It goes like this.

536
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,667
There's a comedian in Osaka
named Biyori Moriya.

537
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,333
He came up with it.

538
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,734
It's really popular backstage
at all the theaters.

539
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,800
It's called "Fartmonica."

540
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,700
You hold a harmonica in your mouth,

541
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,367
then your opponent gives you a butt poke.

542
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,900
If the Fartmonica makes a sound, you lose.

543
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,100
-You can't exhale?
-If you do, you lose.

544
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:00,367
If the poke goes too deep,
wouldn't that be impossible?

545
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:04,166
Even if it goes deep,
you have to hold your breath.

546
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,633
-Can you breathe through your nose?
-That wouldn't make a sound.

547
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,667
He means, are we allowed
to breathe through our noses?

548
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:12,867
Of course.

549
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:15,166
-Or you'd die.
-Just don't make a sound.

550
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,500
Try it.

551
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,900
Go first, Yamaue. Tamura can--

552
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,333
It's Yamauchi.

553
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,033
Yamauchi.

554
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,500
-You called him "Yamaue."
-It's "Yamauchi."

555
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,734
We've been here for two hours now.

556
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,367
Maybe he got confused with
my partner "Hamaie."

557
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,467
I get it.

558
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,300
That makes sense.

559
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,367
Do you often confuse names?
Like when you're at home?

560
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,967
-You never say "Norika" by mistake?
-I'd never do that.

561
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,667
-You don't?
-I've never done that. Not at home.

562
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,767
-Who goes first? Yamauchi?
-Yeah, Yamauchi.

563
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,000
Will I be the one who gets poked?

564
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:52,600
-Can I leave my pants on?
-This sounds scary.

565
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,934
Okay, I'll show you how it's done.

566
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,467
I've done it before.

567
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:57,934
For starters. As a guide.

568
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,734
This is how you endure it.

569
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,500
Make sure you don't poke a bone.
You'll get hurt.

570
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,767
Aim right here.

571
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,700
-Right here.
-Okay. Are you ready?

572
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:06,734
Wait a minute.

573
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,133
-If I make a sound, I lose.
-Right.

574
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
Ready?

575
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm gonna kill you!

576
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,567
That was a surprise.

577
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,800
Now say your "Cha!" gag.

578
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,133
I'm not that type of guy.

579
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,333
Sorry. I messed up.

580
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,633
But "I'm gonna kill you" was out of line.

581
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,800
I could forgive something like a kick,

582
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,300
but he looked me in the eye and said,
"I'm gonna kill you."

583
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:41,867
-I think he misunderstood something.
-It was an honest mistake.

584
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,166
It's his first time.

585
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,300
-Sorry.
-Try again.

586
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,967
Everyone's doing such a great job.

587
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,133
Here I go.

588
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,934
I'll smash you to death!

589
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,500
He's serious.

590
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,333
He really wants to do it.

591
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,900
Maybe something happened.
Did he buy your virtual currency?

592
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:12,433
Can't we play the Fartmonica game?

593
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,333
How does the Fartmonica go again?

594
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,066
You put this in your mouth,
you get a butt poke,

595
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:20,200
and you try not to let out a sound.

596
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:21,800
Get it?

597
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,433
Shall I do an over-exaggerated Harumafuji?

598
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,667
Why?

599
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,133
Dosukoi!

600
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,333
Karaoke dosukoi!

601
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,533
It wasn't that exaggerated.

602
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,367
Maybe that wasn't an exaggeration.

603
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,200
He may have hit him even harder.

604
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:46,967
That was funny.

605
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,633
So funny.

606
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,433
Ready?

607
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,233
I'm really going to do it.
This is the Fartmonica.

608
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:56,867
Ready?

609
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:53,233
Takahashi and Yamauchi!

610
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:54,967
Who laughed?

611
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,266
Who was it?

612
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,834
-That hurt!
-It wasn't me!

613
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,834
-You both laughed at the same time.
-I swear Yamauchi laughed first!

614
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,266
Absolutely!

615
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:07,567
-You're right.
-There were several at once.

616
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:10,367
This could be a double penalty.

617
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,133
That was nasty, Zakoshi.

618
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,433
What's with you?

619
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,400
It hurt!

620
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,600
Let the sound out!

621
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,734
It hurt!

622
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,734
That required high-level techniques.

623
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
It really hurt!

624
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,900
Let's look at Takahashi first.

625
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,433
He's still holding out here.

626
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:34,500
He's laughing.

627
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,033
Now let's look at Yamauchi.

628
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,400
He's already smiling.

629
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:41,166
Is it a smile...

630
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,400
He totally laughed.

631
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,734
It's a double penalty.

632
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,600
Him and Takahashi?

633
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:50,900
Takahashi gets this.

634
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,400
Good, good.

635
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,700
Is this Yamauchi's first card?

636
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,033
It's my first, yes.

637
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,667
It may be your first,
but I have to give you this.

638
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,400
You burst into laughter.

639
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,533
That's harsh.

640
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,367
I think I got a big point.

641
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:08,133
-You did.
-Right?

642
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,200
Right? You're supposed to blow it hard...

643
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:16,934
Anything else?

644
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,667
-Who's that?
-I heard a knock.

645
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:21,967
-Come in.
-It arrived.

646
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,300
Oh, Mommy.

647
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,166
Hello.

648
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,800
-Mommy?
-Thank you.

649
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,600
That looks delicious.

650
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,500
Thank you very much.

651
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:32,400
Thanks.

652
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,633
-The order wasn't too weird?
-It was fine.

653
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Thank you.

654
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,100
May we have your name?

655
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,734
-I'm Tabuchi.
-Mr. Tabuchi?

656
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,300
You're not Mommy, are you?

657
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,734
No, I'm not.

658
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,400
What's in your fanny pack?

659
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,200
-Things I need to make deliveries.
-Like change?

660
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,600
Change and things like that.

661
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,867
No penis stickers?

662
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:51,033
Right.

663
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:52,767
Excuse me.

664
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,100
Thank you very much.

665
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,133
It looks delicious!

666
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,367
There's soy sauce.

667
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,734
It's exquisite.

668
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:01,900
It's amazing.

669
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,834
Who wants to play "Russian Isojin"?

670
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,400
-Russian Roulette with medical gargle?
-No way.

671
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:10,300
-Will the smell give it away?
-Put some in a dish.

672
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,300
How would it work? We dip sushi in it?

673
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,867
If they're the same color...

674
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,533
-It's the same!
-They'll use it instead of soy sauce.

675
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,633
-This is the soy sauce.
-You can't tell!

676
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:20,934
The color is a little...

677
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
Isojin is a bit paler.

678
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,100
What if you mix it with soy sauce?

679
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,734
Eikoh, why don't you try this?

680
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,967
Be the guinea pig.

681
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,033
Make an Isojin version of your gag.

682
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,867
-Yeah, it will work.
-"Iso-jin."

683
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,300
Iso-jin!

684
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,867
-It works.
-Pretty good.

685
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,700
Let's eat!

686
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,667
I'll have tuna belly first.

687
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,300
You should all try this.

688
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:50,500
-Looks delicious.
-It's super good.

689
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,967
The tuna belly's fat
should balance it out.

690
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,166
Yeah, I think so.

691
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:55,200
Looks yummy.

692
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,533
I'm going for it.

693
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,400
He dipped the rice, too.

694
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,233
What's wrong?

695
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,633
What is it?

696
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,633
He's scary.

697
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:20,300
-Is it that bad?
-Really?

698
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,533
That looks bad.

699
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,700
-Something black came out.
-What is that?

700
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,900
-What's that black stuff?
-What is this?

701
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,000
-It made a chemical reaction?
-It turned black!

702
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,233
-Creepy!
-So creepy!

703
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,066
-Why did it turn black?
-Show us.

704
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,867
The tuna had a chemical reaction.

705
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:38,000
It's black!

706
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,233
It's poison.

707
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:42,367
-How did it taste?
-Delicious.

708
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:43,667
It was delicious?

709
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,200
How can it be delicious?

710
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:55,200
It's a grotesque color.

711
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,433
-It's pitch black!
-For real?

712
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,600
-It's kind of purple.
-They held on.

713
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,500
Let's decide who goes next.

714
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,467
-Not after seeing that.
-For real?

715
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:05,433
-Not after that.
-No way!

716
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,633
Let's see what happens with sea urchin.

717
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,266
Every time I breathe through my nose,
I smell Isojin and fat.

718
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,567
Do they react with each other?

719
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:18,433
Maybe it's the fat.
Maybe that reacted to the Isojin.

720
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,300
-How did it taste?
-Delicious.

721
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,100
It was delicious?

722
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,934
Someone give it a try.

723
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:26,834
-How about the egg?
-The egg.

724
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,166
-E-G-G.
-Sounds safe.

725
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,734
-Easy?
-E-G-G and easy.

726
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,500
Easy? Then give it a try.

727
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,400
Huh?

728
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:34,200
-It's easy, right?
-Go for it.

729
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,533
-It's just the egg.
-There's no rice?

730
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,367
-But with Isojin?
-I know.

731
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,100
There's no rice underneath.

732
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,233
Oh, no.

733
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,734
Only egg. Wow, it turned red.

734
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,467
It's already reacting!

735
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,800
-Chemistry turned it red.
-It's already reacting, Shigeo!

736
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:55,433
Eat it!

737
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,967
Who said that?

738
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,333
Here it comes.

739
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,600
-This is not good.
-It slowly gets worse.

740
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:13,867
It's blackish.

741
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,400
-I told you.
-It really tastes gross.

742
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:23,834
That was plain egg.

743
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:25,500
It was yellow.

744
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,433
There was no chemical reaction.

745
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,800
How was the taste?

746
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,400
-Super delicious.
-Delicious?

747
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:31,934
You were waiting for that.

748
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
-It was written all over your face.
-Before the deed.

749
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,166
-What a turn off.
-It started way back.

750
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,367
But there was no chemical reaction.

751
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:42,133
-It didn't turn black.
-All thanks to the tuna.

752
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,433
Maybe it was Eikoh's mouth that caused it?

753
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,500
Eikoh makes it black.

754
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:48,767
It can't be.

755
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:50,767
Do you excrete ink or something?

756
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,633
But it really was purple...

757
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,800
Did you fart?

758
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,467
Was that you?

759
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,200
Yes.

760
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,400
That's how you timed it?

761
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,133
Yes.

762
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,734
How honest of you.

763
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,200
So...

764
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,533
Do you know who this belongs to?

765
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,333
-Is it a school uniform?
-No, it's a suit.

766
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,367
-Is that Dr. Hattori's?
-It is.

767
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,767
-That Hattori?
-The chef.

768
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,266
How did you get it?

769
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,467
Why don't we see who looks best in this?

770
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:30,033
I think that'll be me.

771
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,600
Yeah, it might suit him.

772
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,567
Having a strong build helps.

773
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,033
Size-wise, it's me.

774
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,433
I think so too.

775
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,500
-Is he still wearing the pink vibrator?
-Yeah, the whole time.

776
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:45,367
I bet he's smirking about it.
Turning it on and off.

777
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,834
-He turns it on and off?
-Probably.

778
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,500
He's trying to look like Hattori.

779
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,600
How's the food?

780
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,033
Dr. Hattori's celebrating the New Year.

781
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,066
How festive.

782
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:00,500
Happy New Year.

783
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,300
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

784
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,667
Happy New Year.

785
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,166
Yamauchi goes next.

786
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,667
-Okay.
-Yamauchi?

787
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:15,533
He should look good in it.

788
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:18,100
Yeah, maybe.

789
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:28,166
This sushi's good.

790
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:31,967
What are you drinking?

791
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:33,867
Breast milk.

792
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,533
No, seriously.

793
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,633
Calpis.

794
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,600
-He has tattoos.
-Dr. Hattori?

795
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:49,500
Yes.

796
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,300
-Are you really Dr. Hattori?
-Yes.

797
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:56,533
He had tattoos like that?

798
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,867
You have tattoos?

799
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,233
Yeah.

800
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,500
The culinary school president?

801
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,033
-The chef?
-Yeah.

802
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,533
Did you have a rough past?

803
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:08,734
In the past.

804
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:10,500
How about your back?

805
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:14,533
That's impressive!

806
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,533
-A koi.
-Is that a koi?

807
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,033
You can cook it.

808
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,367
Oh, a koi dish.

809
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,133
Your front has nothing to do with cooking.

810
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,300
It's a Prajna.

811
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,000
They're spread apart. Each one's separate.

812
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,767
Because I got them one by one.

813
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:32,100
From now on I'm always going to
imagine him without clothes.

814
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,400
Yeah, you're right.

815
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:37,266
I've been getting a tattoo
for each memory.

816
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,233
See this one?

817
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,633
It's when I crushed
all the teams in Osaka.

818
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,767
Teams?

819
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:46,600
-Motorcycle gangs. Crews.
-He must've been a member.

820
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,667
When did you get your back done?

821
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,700
When I opened the culinary school.

822
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,367
-As a memento?
-As a memento.

823
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,133
How about the one on your right chest?

824
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,867
This is the only one...

825
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:00,734
I got against my will.

826
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:02,834
Who did it?

827
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:04,233
Kawa...

828
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:06,567
Kawagoe.

829
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,734
The French cuisine chef?

830
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,133
Chef Kawagoe?

831
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,200
You had a falling out?

832
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:14,934
He came to your school once.

833
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,967
When he did, he did this to me.

834
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:18,200
He did that to you?

835
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:19,200
Sounds scary.

836
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,266
By force?

837
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,767
I'd say it was forceful.

838
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,967
When a bunch of French chefs got together.

839
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:28,834
Are French chefs that dangerous?

840
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,333
Be careful of French chefs.

841
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,000
Do you often have arguments among chefs?

842
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,567
No, they're not.

843
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:36,567
Don't you cook anymore?

844
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,934
I no longer cook at all.

845
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:44,166
I haven't for about 12 years.

846
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,300
Not at all?

847
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,233
He is so annoying.

848
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:50,700
Thank you.

849
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,266
I haven't eaten any.

850
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,700
I have a question.

851
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,600
What do you do with your pubic hair?

852
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:08,000
What do you do with your pubic hair?

853
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:09,834
-What do we do?
-Nothing.

854
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,166
You leave it on, right?

855
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,900
Most of the world views that
as being super unclean.

856
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,667
-I heard.
-Why?

857
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:19,367
Only Asians leave it on.

858
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,900
I hear only Japanese people
leave it on these days.

859
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:24,600
What do you do?

860
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:25,867
Actually...

861
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:29,266
I went all the way.

862
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,567
-When?
-What the heck?

863
00:44:32,734 --> 00:44:33,767
So...

864
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,900
Wanna try it?

865
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,367
Seiji does that too.

866
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,467
It's called a Brazilian wax.

867
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:42,967
He showed me. It was super clean.

868
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:45,834
-Right? It works.
-You could show this on TV.

869
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,734
-It's super smooth.
-But your skin's super rough.

870
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,633
I have a skin rash.
I've only just had it done.

871
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,400
-It's still rough.
-Should we connect the dots?

872
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:56,400
I think they might form a picture.

873
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:57,867
These dots?

874
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,533
Give me a pen.

875
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,033
Will you draw it for me?

876
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,800
-Maybe it's a secret message.
-Looks promising.

877
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,667
-I have MA, too.
-What's "MA"?

878
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:10,500
-"M"?
-"MA." Metal Allergy.

879
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:11,600
From your belt?

880
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,867
This looks awful.

881
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,166
It's because I have MA.

882
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:21,767
Don't you smoke anymore, Zakoshi?

883
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:22,834
I quit.

884
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,300
Why fart now?

885
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,033
That sounded like something else came out.

886
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,333
This is amazing.

887
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,834
-What?
-Let's all fart.

888
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,166
Can you see something?

889
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,467
Something has appeared.

890
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,200
Seriously.

891
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,333
-I just connected the dots.
-No faking?

892
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,300
No faking.

893
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,934
He connected all the dots.

894
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,467
Right? I seriously did.

895
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:51,333
-Suneo?
-It looks like Suneo.

896
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,967
I had Suneo on my belly.

897
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,233
It appeared naturally?

898
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,700
Something might be on your bellies too.

899
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,600
I keep my hair short, actually.

900
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,800
-You do?
-But I don't shave.

901
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,266
I brought some Brazilian wax.

902
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,533
But mine's short.

903
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,000
How do you do it?

904
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,300
Does it hurt?

905
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,300
-Mine's like...
-You cut it?

906
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:13,467
-I do.
-Why?

907
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,967
See?

908
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,767
-It's short.
-And thin.

909
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:17,867
It is.

910
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:19,967
Or we could do your armpits.

911
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,533
I keep mine short.

912
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,033
That's perfect.
It doesn't work if it's too long.

913
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,333
I'm well-groomed.

914
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,133
I can do this. Done it myself.

915
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,900
-It doesn't grow back for a while?
-That's right.

916
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:32,033
That sounds scary.

917
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,100
But yours is growing. How come?

918
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,700
It still grows, but there's less hair.

919
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:38,433
-That's scary.
-Scary indeed.

920
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,333
What is that?

921
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,333
-It looks like lube.
-I swear this takes hair off perfectly.

922
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,633
-You'll be moved.
-Yeah, it is like lube.

923
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,867
It comes right off?

924
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:49,900
Yes.

925
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,700
So scary.

926
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:55,500
It's just like mizuame candy.

927
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,767
That looks thick.

928
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:58,667
Is it supposed to be that thick?

929
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:01,266
It's so thick.

930
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,900
What do you do with that?

931
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,467
That must be enough.

932
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:06,233
Nori-ka.

933
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,300
-"Norika"?
-No, no.

934
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,867
You clearly said, "Norika."

935
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,600
-I meant, "Is that nori glue?"
-You still like her?

936
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:16,166
It reminded you of her?

937
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,266
Why would this remind me of her?

938
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,934
How do you remove it?

939
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,600
You put that much on?

940
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:24,567
What is this?

941
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,500
What a well-behaved penis.

942
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,500
It's a clever penis.

943
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,066
It's like mizuame...

944
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,700
What was that?

945
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,100
I'd totally forgotten about it.

946
00:47:37,633 --> 00:47:40,667
I was flattered that he called
my penis well-behaved.

947
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:45,800
-You laughed so heartily.
-That was a hearty laugh.

948
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,166
Really.

949
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:51,000
I was so happy he called
my penis well-behaved.

950
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,734
That was such a well-mannered laugh.

951
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:56,767
I was just happy.

952
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:58,433
So, Kobayashi...

953
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,533
-It's his first card?
-It is.

954
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,934
That was a big laugh.

955
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,166
It was.

956
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,300
It can't be!

957
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,233
-No, it's not.
-You scared me!

958
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,500
But I get an orange?

959
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,300
I guess that deserved orange.

960
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes. That was...
He laughed just like normal.

961
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,066
He got an orange.

962
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:21,800
But more importantly,

963
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:24,266
before that happened, there was Jinnai...

964
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,200
You said, "Norika."

965
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:28,533
-What a goof up.
-A total goof up.

966
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,066
That was awful of me.

967
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:32,633
-I want to give you a card for that.
-Wait!

968
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,233
-What did I say?
-"Norika..."

969
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,667
I said "Nori-ka" as in "Is that glue?"

970
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:38,633
-I was shocked.
-Sorry for that.

971
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,567
I almost lost it myself.

972
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:44,967
You put that much on?

973
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:46,000
What is this?

974
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:47,700
What a well-behaved penis.

975
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:51,533
What was that?

976
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,867
You looked so smug.

977
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,233
What a tender smile!

978
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:56,800
How can I put it?

979
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,900
It was nice to be praised.

980
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:00,533
You felt proud, right?

981
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:02,533
I took it as a compliment.

982
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:05,934
Are we all on our last chance?

983
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,066
-I am.
-Me too.

984
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,100
I've got one. I'm still on yellow.

985
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,734
Many are still on yellow.

986
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,834
-Except for Zakoshi.
-I have none.

987
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,767
Zero.

988
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,600
He has no cards
and he's scored some big points.

989
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:18,567
I have zero cards.

990
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:25,266
-It's ready?
-He can take it off?

991
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,300
It's ready.

992
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,400
It's gonna hurt?

993
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:31,166
It doesn't look good.
We left it on too long.

994
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:32,600
Let's go.

995
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:35,734
I'm in trouble? Then hurry up.

996
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:39,100
-Why don't you make it a "Harmonica Wax"?
-Good idea.

997
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:42,266
-With the Fartmonica.
-The Fartmonica.

998
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,367
Is he okay?

999
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,533
That looks painful.

1000
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,100
Will he be okay?

1001
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,633
-Won't that rip his skin?
-How does it work?

1002
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,166
-Is this safe?
-He has a lot of hair.

1003
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:53,433
This is scary!

1004
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,467
Ready?

1005
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,367
Who was that?

1006
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:06,900
-It had to be Tamura.
-Definitely Tamura!

1007
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:09,900
-That had to hurt.
-He's in pain.

1008
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:11,967
-That hurts real bad.
-Are you okay?

1009
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:13,233
That hurt!

1010
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,700
What did you do to me?

1011
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:16,100
That looked so painful.

1012
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:17,900
Who laughed?

1013
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:20,700
-That was the worst.
-Tamura has to take care of him.

1014
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,867
-Look at it hanging.
-That really hurt.

1015
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,834
-That hurt bad.
-No way.

1016
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,834
What happened?

1017
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,433
He did his bit and laughed at it,
all by himself.

1018
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,967
This could end up a red card.

1019
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:30,934
That's right.

1020
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
-At the moment...
-This can't be true!

1021
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,633
He has a yellow card.

1022
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,767
We'll see if he gets away with an orange,
or if he goes straight to red.

1023
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:40,834
-Let's take a look.
-But that was...

1024
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,166
Why did I even start that?

1025
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,133
No laugh, right?

1026
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:50,667
-I'm not laughing!
-Yes, you are!

1027
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:52,233
You were totally laughing!

1028
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,600
He completely was.

1029
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,567
He was smiling before that, too.

1030
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:56,633
That harmonica.

1031
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,867
You looked like Takuzo Kawatani.

1032
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:03,400
That chin.

1033
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,800
But you know what?

1034
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,633
With it looking so funny,
and sounding so funny,

1035
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,667
I totally lost track of
why I was even doing all this.

1036
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,800
Red!

1037
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,934
He got it!

1038
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,467
For real?

1039
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:26,800
-What happens now?
-That deserved it.

1040
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:29,934
It's like mizuame.

1041
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,734
So, guys, you need to do it for him again.

1042
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,633
-Do what?
-We don't know how.

1043
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,567
You stick this sheet on.

1044
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:38,033
And then...

1045
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,834
Yank it hard.

1046
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,734
-You'd better lie down.
-No way. I'm scared.

1047
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,400
-He should lie down.
-But look at you.

1048
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,066
You have no choice now.

1049
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,934
Someone needs to take over.

1050
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:52,300
There are so many bits I didn't get to do.

1051
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:57,367
You thought I had none left?

1052
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:00,367
Then why did you invite me?

1053
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:04,266
That was so quick. Was I the second one?

1054
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,367
Yes.

1055
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:10,533
I totally did it to myself.
I should've let someone else do it.

1056
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,100
Kobayashi's penis had been
so well-behaved up to that point.

1057
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,633
But when I yanked the sheet,
it popped out.

1058
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,767
I really wanted to stay a little longer.

1059
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,333
Just a little longer.

1060
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,700
Hey, somebody.

1061
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:34,967
Would any of you happen to have
a charger cable for this PSP?

1062
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,834
Did they date before having intercourse?
Or did they have intercourse, then date?

1063
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:47,934
Zombie Time!

1064
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,333
Zombie?

1065
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,367
The World Cup.
