1
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,500
Matsumoto-san, I don't think these guys want the money

2
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,220
- No no no
 - That's not true

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,330
That's what we feel like

4
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,200
You guys don't have that hunger from your youth

5
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,100
- No it's not like that

6
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,820
- Well if you put it like that
 - Kinoshita can you do it?

7
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,560
- I think these guys have the wrong technique for winning the money

8
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
- I think these guys have the wrong technique for winning the money
 - I see

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,070
If you think about it,

10
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,220
you should be putting on a show

11
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,740
You earn money by putting on a show

12
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,160
That's right, this is supposed to be entertainment

13
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,860
I used to dance when I was a teenager

14
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,160
So I want to recreate that time

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,400
We used to dance in front of the NAVIO in Osaka

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,920
So I want to dance for you guys and recreate that time

17
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,220
Aiming for the prize, onegaishimasu!

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,440
(... that's why he's in blackface?!)

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,260
He's not in sync

20
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,330
He's just getting started

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,420
Got a bad feeling about this

22
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,080
In front of the NAVIO, the NAVIO

23
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,120
Aim for the prize money

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,840
- He's having fun
 - The judges are ready

25
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,440
The whole time I was watching, all I could think is,

26
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,440
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

27
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,820
Not only can he not dance,

28
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,120
it's not even entertaining!

29
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,360
I will do some karate stone breaking

30
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,700
I think this might be it

31
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,000
In the past, I've broken 10 stones on this show (Special Skill Demonstration episode)

32
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,340
Today, I will do 15 stones

33
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,000
- Will this turn out okay?
 - Fujiwara make sure it's alrught

34
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,100
- Go at your own pace Fujiwara

35
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,700
There might be fragments, so I will wear these goggles

36
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,120
Regardless of if it breaks or not, the judges will decide if it's a success

37
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,720
We wanna see someone win the 30,000 yen

38
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,511
- Barely broke them
 - Write down his score

39
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:55,555
That's it?

40
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,560
He didn't even break 10

41
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,844
He broke 7 stones

42
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,977
All I can remember is his "Senya!"

43
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,511
That "Senya" is really embarassing, isn't it?

44
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,222
Most people would get 700 yen

45
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:28,666
Fujiwara, what happened?

46
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,600
It, genuinely hurts

47
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:59,209
This is something I've tried on other TV shows

48
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:03,755
I think I can win by tight-rope walking

49
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,088
That is certainly unique

50
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,555
I will cross this 7m rope (0.077 football fields)

51
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,511
You're not just messing around right?

52
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,688
No of course not

53
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:19,596
I think he can do this, since Tanaka is a serious boy

54
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,933
He takes this kind of thing seriously

55
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,355
- His clothes are lame though
 - His clothes <i>are</i> lame

56
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:28,244
C'mon focus

57
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,640
Please, allow me to focus

58
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,111
Tanaka-kun, proceed at your own pace

59
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:04,400
- That's ok
 - No problem you can do it

60
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,733
He's safe if he returns right?

61
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,955
Yeah he just can't fall down part way

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,555
Is it better to be slow, or fast?

63
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,660
Here he goes

64
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,488
- That's OK
 - He's still safe

65
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:44,622
That's all you can do!

66
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:49,000
- Let him focus
 - Focus, focus!

67
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:54,222
"Are you kidding me?" is all I can think right now

68
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,866
There's no way he can return now right?

69
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,155
What is this?

70
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,977
He <i><b>really</i></b> returned after that huh?

71
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,228
That "PAN!" was really loud

72
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,828
Why does his ass make a "PAN!"?

73
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:00,314
You're done man!

74
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,371
What are you doing?

75
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,514
- Get down!
 - He can do it!

76
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:08,342
It doesn't matter if he can do it

77
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:17,106
No hang on, why is he doing it again?

78
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,088
He's done!

79
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:04,600
Why did you keep doing it over and over again?

80
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:09,800
You're just entertaining yourself while mom makes dinner!

81
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,733
Until she says "it's ready!"

82
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,400
This is not supposed to be a way to kill time

83
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,600
What was that, seriously?

84
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:33,933
If I get another chance, I'd like to try again

85
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,822
Why would you get another chance?

86
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,355
No more chances?

87
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:40,000
Cause, man,

88
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,658
The rice is cooked already!

89
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,911
- Mom's done cooking?
 - The rice is cooked man

90
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,555
She's telling you to hurry up

91
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,311
Dad started drinking his beer already

92
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,422
What are you guys gonna do, seriously

93
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:05,466
- Can you still do this?
 - Please let us continue

94
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,555
30,000 is too much I think,

95
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,066
can we lower the prize amount?

96
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,977
Tell us then

97
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,396
Tell us, how much you are aiming for

98
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:23,400
Like "I'm aiming for 40,000"

99
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,200
I can make this cardboard box very quickly

100
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,444
Someone else should do it first so you guys understand how good I am

101
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,311
Tsukajiro-san, please try this out

102
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,911
Try this out, fold the carboard box

103
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:58,200
- Fast as you can
 - Into a box right?

104
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,815
He's fast!

105
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,288
He's an expert!

106
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,911
17 seconds

107
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,222
That's pretty quick

108
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,155
That is pretty fast,

109
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,000
but I can do it in half that time

110
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:33,169
How much is this worth?

111
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,844
15,000 yen

112
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:40,844
Wel'll start when you say OK

113
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,118
That seems like cheating

114
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,244
- Are you opening it?
 - No, no I'm not

115
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,240
What are you doing? Stop that!

116
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,511
I'm just checking the fold

117
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,355
- 9 minutes, 20 seconds
 - Thank you very much

118
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:21,044
It was pretty sloppy

119
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,111
If you set your own prize amount, and can't win it ...

120
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,311
Right?

121
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,444
This is tough

122
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,933
It wasn't even that funny

123
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,288
- You don't wanna hear that
 - Yeah that sucks

124
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:03,659
There used to be a TV talent show that gave you a white guitar for performing right?

125
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:07,555
While I was watching that show, I did the same thing they did

126
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:12,702
And that guy won that white guitar

127
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,066
So I want to perform that talent that won him a guitar

128
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,733
A white guitar is expensive

129
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,288
So I am aiming for 12,000 yen

130
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:32,822
I will my put my ear, inside my ear

131
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:43,088
"Put my ear ... inside ... my ear"

132
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,355
It's in!

133
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:02,952
None of us can do it right?

134
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:10,126
So close!!!

135
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,000
That was close desu ne?

136
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,466
That was certainly not something anybody can do

137
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,866
But you came close though

138
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,333
Next, Tsukajiro tried jumping rope 20 times in a row

139
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:52,644
Then, Fujiwara from LISCENCE performed his nose-mouth udon act!

140
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,488
- It's a walkway
 - Udon walkway

141
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,577
If you ask me,

142
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,844
this is a terrible day for all of us

143
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,295
Can you guys do it or not?

144
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:29,488
I still use a flip phone, even today

145
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,888
On this flip phone,

146
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,133
I can type out a text without looking at the phone

147
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:43,719
So if you guys give me a phrase I can just tap it out

148
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,688
- I can type that phrase, without mistakes

149
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,106
- I can type that phrase, without mistakes
 - How much is this worth?

150
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,822
1500 yen (~$15)

151
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,111
So cheap!

152
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,355
Well OK, it depends on the phrase

153
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:59,111
Write out "Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arrahende"

154
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:08,288
He's looking towards me

155
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,133
How did I do?

156
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,644
3000?!

157
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,711
He gave you 3000!

158
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,711
I thought it was worth that much

159
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,711
How do I put it, it's kind of an illusion

160
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,767
An illusion is a great idea

161
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,337
- Everyone, please look at that monitor screen
 - Again?

162
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,509
I am doing it live, but please view it on the monitor

163
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,111
I really want to win 4000 yen

164
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,355
In just a moment, you will see, in my mouth, an illusion

165
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,955
I present my "Mouth Water"

166
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:34,622
It is over in an instant, so please pay attention

167
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,600
With that said, here I go

168
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:03,044
"Mouth Water"?

169
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,933
But we've seen this before, you know

170
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,511
We've seen this before?

171
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,088
This TV show has been airing for a while

172
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,000
We've been doing this for 29 years

173
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,422
He's done this on a previous episode

174
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:38,177
What does this mean, I don't understand

175
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,622
I've seen this so many times

176
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,222
And during the drum roll,

177
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,101
you did it by accident

178
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,400
What do we do, should we leave it all up to Tanaka?

179
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,022
Please let me have my revenge

180
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,755
- Can you do it?!
 - YES, YES!

181
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:17,422
We've had enough fooling around

182
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,866
I have no choice here but to succeed

183
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,311
I will give us a good ending!

184
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,844
30,000 yen, that is what I want

185
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,400
So you're not changing the prize money

186
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,355
At your own pace

187
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,311
- You're alright
 - Focus!

188
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,355
The way he returned was not cool

189
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:26,911
Like he was about to advance

190
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,177
He's halfway there

191
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,377
This is tricky!

192
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:58,911
"This is tricky!"

193
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,911
Alright we're done!

194
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:14,133
Though the filming is over, some big news for Downtown?!

195
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:26,562
Hamada-san's Kyary Pyamyu Pyamyu - I mean Hamada Byamyu Byamyu

196
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:48,511
Kyary Pyamyu Pyamyu's producer,

197
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,133
wants to make song for Hamada-san

198
00:22:57,688 --> 00:23:02,400
So just forget about this 30K yen thing

199
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,622
This is a big chance for you

200
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:27,444
Your fate has really changed!
