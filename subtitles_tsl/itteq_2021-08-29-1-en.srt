1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:03,584
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:05,459
Today's first segment is...

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,292
Daisuke Miyagawa's
Way to Japanese Festivals.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,375
A certain day.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,876
Here it is.

6
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:15,999
You startled me.

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,500
I hit it.
 Ow.

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,500
The season of festival
has come this month.

9
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:20,876
You'll be surprised.

10
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,667
Do you feel like you're older
or you've become weaker?

11
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,876
It's sad, but I do.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,209
I turn 49 this September.

13
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,584
I'm 49.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,083
Of course... of course
I've got many things.

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,375
I have various old wounds too.

16
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,792
When the rainy season comes,

17
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,417
the old wound I got from
the Cheese Rolling Festival...

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
It's my medal.

19
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,042
Where's that?
 My neck.

20
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,334
You say that all the time.

21
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,709
Even 15 years after
the Cheese Rolling Festival.

22
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:55,876
It's true.

23
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,584
No matter which osteopathic clinic
I go to,

24
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,500
they say my neck is bad.

25
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:03,667
They ask if I've had an accident,
I'd say, "I haven't."

26
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,626
"Had it been subjected
to impact, then?"

27
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:10,167
"Oh, the Cheese Rolling Festival.
I guess that's it."

28
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,751
The stages this time are Hokkaido
and Hiroshima Prefecture.

29
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,667
Okay, let's go!

30
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,417
Hokkaido, Hiroshima, here I come!

31
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,584
What kind of festivals
await him this time?

32
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:31,584
"The Quest"

33
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,375
Welcome to The Quest.

34
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,500
Today, it's Daisuke Miyagawa's
Way to Japanese Festivals,

35
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:40,417
and Asako Ito's Mystery Tour.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,667
Wasshoi!

37
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,709
"Morisanchu"

38
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,667
Hello...

39
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:44,709
Hello!

40
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,042
Hello, everyone.

41
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:47,626
"Daisuke Miyagawa's fishing trip"
"Scallop fishing &amp; bicycle race"

42
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,417
I'm impressed by the champion!

43
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,626
It's so difficult.

44
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,542
It's what chimpanzees ride.

45
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,999
Who's this person? Go away! No!

46
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:00,292
It's coming... No!

47
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,999
It hit my crotch!

48
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,500
Daisuke Miyagawa's
Way to Japanese Festivals.

49
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,083
He has come to Toyoura Town
in Hokkaido.

50
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:10,792
Wasshoi!

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,500
The place I have come to

52
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:17,292
is Toyoura Town in Hokkaido.

53
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,334
Have a look at this.

54
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,626
Unfortunately, it's cloudy,

55
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,375
but this is a nice place.

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,125
Festival Guy in Hokkaido,

57
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:27,751
bring it on!

58
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:28,999
Hello.

59
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,584
Our guide is...

60
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,250
Funkawan Toyoura Tourism
Association's Directorgeneral,

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,250
Mr Takamitsu Okamoto.

62
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,667
Is this festival dangerous?

63
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,334
It isn't dangerous, but...

64
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,000
It isn't, but?

65
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,125
You need observation skills.
 Observation skills?

66
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,626
Quick response.
 Quick response?

67
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,209
And irritation.
 Irritation?

68
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,417
It depends on how much irritation
you can give.

69
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,417
How much irritation I can give?

70
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,209
I am the one who irritates?

71
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,918
I'm not on the receiving end?
I'll irritate?

72
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,959
How do you do it?

73
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:04,500
Like this.

74
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,292
A whip! It's a whip!

75
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,584
It's like this,

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,209
or like this.
 What?

77
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:12,876
You kneeled. On the other knee?
 What's this?

78
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,459
On one knee.

79
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,999
On one knee?

80
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,042
On both knees.
 Both knees!

81
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,417
What's that?
It's like some technique.

82
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,709
It's done at the championship.

83
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,667
You'll irritate something when you
compete in this world championship.

84
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:25,626
Wait, I don't get it.

85
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,709
It's a world championship?
 Yes, it is.

86
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,751
Has the champion been
winning consecutive years?

87
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,792
Someone had won
three years in a row.

88
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,375
Will that person come today?

89
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,834
Please give me some time.

90
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,042
They go to the venue this time,

91
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,792
Toyoura Town
Regional Exchange Centre.

92
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,792
Mr Miyagawa,
please have a look at that.

93
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,292
What did Miyagawa see there?

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,083
It's men pulling up scallops.

95
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,500
Wait a minute. It's scallop fishing?

96
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:01,709
This is Toyoura World
Scallop Fishing Championship.

97
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,334
What?

98
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:07,918
In the Toyoura
World Scallop Fishing Championship.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,834
Participants will pull up scallops
in the tank within the limited time,

100
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,000
and see who gets the biggest number.

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,584
Toyoura Town here faces Funkawan,

102
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:19,959
the culture of scallop thrives,

103
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,626
and it has more than 50 years
of history.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,375
The Scallop Fishing Championship
was cancelled in 2020 and 2021,

105
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,500
so everyone is looking forward
to it being held again.

106
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,042
It's like this.

107
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:36,083
Put the needle in the place
you find to irritate it.

108
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,876
Startle it, so that it closes.
 That's right.

109
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:42,042
Here it goes...

110
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,375
It falls if it doesn't bite firmly.

111
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,876
Is that so?
 Yes.

112
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,959
Like him... Oh, he's skilled.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,500
When you take it off...

114
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,167
Quick response. That's it.

115
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,542
Yes, this.

116
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,709
Everyone, that looks a bit like...

117
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:59,542
the prowrestling group's colouring.
But it isn't, right?

118
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:00,500
We didn't copy it.

119
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, you did.

120
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,375
We didn't copy it.

121
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,584
Isn't it New Japan Prowrestling?
 No...

122
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,000
You copied it.

123
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,167
No. Not at all.
 You didn't?

124
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,792
Is that so?
 Yeah.

125
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,959
Wait, that's NJPW!

126
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,918
Now, he'll practise the real thing.

127
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,292
Please tell me the official rules.
 Okay.

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,125
There are healthy scallops
in the water tank,

129
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:25,334
you'll catch as many as you can
in three minutes.

130
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,834
Three minutes.
 Yes.

131
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:30,250
He'll use a fishing rod
specifically for scallops.

132
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,834
It's a stretched curtain rail.
 Yes.

133
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,375
How do you know?
 Yeah.

134
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,584
There's a red part on the rod,

135
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,751
you must not hold or touch
any part other than that.

136
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,125
When you're fishing,
do not touch the line.

137
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,751
People tend to do that,
but it's not allowed.

138
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,167
If you focus on the scallops
too much,

139
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,626
you might wrap the line
around the rod's tip.

140
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,083
Yes, you might.

141
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,167
It's easier to fish if it's shorter.

142
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,459
Yes.
 If it wraps around the tip once,

143
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,459
it's not allowed.
 I see.

144
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,709
There's something I'd like you
to pay attention to most.

145
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,209
It's against the rule
to say anything insulting

146
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,584
about Toyoura's scallop.

147
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,334
"What's this stupid scallop?"

148
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,417
I can't say that?
 No, you can't.

149
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,000
We're using the scallops
fishermen cultured with love

150
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,584
for the competition,

151
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,292
so treat the scallops with love.
 Makes sense.

152
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,959
If violation like this is found
by the judge,

153
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,667
it's a yellow scallop.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,417
He just wanted to do this.

155
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,375
If you get one, you'll be suspended
for 15 seconds.

156
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,209
Wow, it costs a lot.
 It does.

157
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,459
You have a red one too?

158
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,083
Leave at once?
 Leave at once!

159
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,000
It's insult towards the judge.

160
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,751
I see. "That one counts, idiot!"

161
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,375
No, not allowed.
 It's not allowed.

162
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,959
It's going to be lively.

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
Very.
 It's funny before it starts.

164
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,959
He tries scallop fishing
based on these rules.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I put it here like this,

166
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,834
put it in like this.
 Yes.

167
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,375
irritate it here.

168
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,709
Irri... oh.

169
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,250
It came out.

170
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,459
I see. When I irritate it,

171
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,083
it might come out.
 Yes.

172
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,209
I'll go here like this...

173
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,542
Where I let it bite matters too.
 Yes.

174
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:12,876
Instead of the chipped part,
put it at the edge...

175
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,709
Put it here, pull, and caught it.
 Well done!

176
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:17,918
And the quick response.

177
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:18,999
Is this okay?

178
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,709
Yes, hold it and pull it out.
 Hold, and the quick response.

179
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:22,959
That's what I do?
 Yes.

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,918
He's so good at it!

181
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:28,417
Now Miyagawa demonstrates his talent
in scallop fishing.

182
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,584
Is this okay here?
 Yes.

183
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,500
I see.

184
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,667
At this time, this is okay, right?

185
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,209
You're good at it.

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,792
This champion
for three years in a row,

187
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:45,834
how many scallops did he catch
in three minutes?

188
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,209
It's a world record.

189
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,542
The champion caught
15 in three minutes.

190
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,375
15 scallops?

191
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:56,667
In other words, the champion caught
one scallop every 12 seconds.

192
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,918
Oh? Maybe I can do it.

193
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,334
Really? One per 12 seconds.

194
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,792
Count 12 seconds for me.

195
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:04,459
Ready, start.

196
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,042
One, two, three, four, five, six...

197
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,876
A scallop that has opened
doesn't always bite.

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,751
10, 11, 12.

199
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,626
Wow, I'm impressed by the champion!

200
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,500
If the position of this is right,
it enters easily,

201
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,334
but it might become straight
when I put it in.

202
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,667
This one is the one
that bothers me most.

203
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:34,042
I want to go for this one
when I get impatient,

204
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,000
but it hasn't bitten even once.

205
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:41,292
It has only been doing...

206
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:44,250
There probably is a trick to it.

207
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:45,834
In the scallop fishing circle...

208
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,500
Scallop fishing circle?
 Yes.

209
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,626
He hasn't become a champion yet,

210
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,083
but he is just as good
as the champion,

211
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,918
and he has come here
to teach you today.

212
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:58,167
He's called the scallop fishing
circle's Unfinished Great Talent.

213
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,584
The name makes me feel sorry
for him.

214
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,876
I wish you wouldn't tell him
if that's the case.

215
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,125
Our unfinished great talent,
Mr Fumihiro Kobayashi.

216
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,125
Yay!

217
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,918
That's right, he is...

218
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:14,834
Mr Kobayashi, who has the ability
but hasn't become the champion.

219
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,751
Would you teach me
how to target them,

220
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,042
or irritate them...

221
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,417
Oh, you kneel on one knee.

222
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,334
I can only kneel
on one knee physically.

223
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:29,459
You start from finding your scallop.

224
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:33,000
The compatibility of the direction
of the hook and the scallop.

225
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,125
I see!

226
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,918
It's already started.
 I see.

227
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,876
Instead of matching the scallop,
it's the hook.

228
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,542
When you've put the hook in,
irritate the scallop.

229
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,959
We call it Beat Fishing.

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,876
Give it the beat, then pull it up.

231
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,125
Okay...

232
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,167
You call this irritation
"Beat Fishing?"

233
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:55,250
It's a wellknown technique
among the scallop fishing circle.

234
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,250
Beat Fishing.
 Beat Fishing.

235
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,999
You do Beat Fishing,
then Mach Detaching.

236
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,667
Mach Detaching?

237
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,000
You didn't pull it out like this
just now. What is it?

238
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,751
Beat Fishing...

239
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:08,209
Knock, knock, knock.

240
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,584
Pull, pull, pull.
 Okay.

241
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,834
Mach Detaching.
 Mach Detaching.

242
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,584
It's like... Mum's laundry.

243
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,167
You pull them down in one go.

244
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,999
Beat Washing.
 That's Beat Washing?

245
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,751
There isn't a name like that.

246
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,292
Hang on.

247
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,792
You can improvise.

248
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,375
Brilliant.

249
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,918
We don't wait till it turns to us,

250
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,375
we put it inside, let it bite.

251
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:33,999
Beat Fishing.

252
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,375
Let it bite.

253
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,417
And then...

254
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,751
Mach Detaching.
 Mach Detaching.

255
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,999
Amazing!

256
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,083
Have you done it before?

257
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,626
No, I haven't.

258
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,167
You successfully did something
I just taught you.

259
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,876
If I can keep doing this, I can win!

260
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll fill up the bucket
in three minutes.

261
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,834
Miyagawa's performance
will be amazing, starting now.

262
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,999
Ready, go.

263
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:57,542
Put it in, then...

264
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,999
I'll give this up.

265
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,083
I'll match this
and insert it like this.

266
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,626
Do Beat Fishing.

267
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,042
Pull it up,

268
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,375
Mach Detaching.

269
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,834
What's this?

270
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,751
Put it in like this.

271
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,834
Then Beat Fishing.

272
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:14,626
When it bites, pull it up.

273
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:15,751
Mach Detaching.

274
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,167
I can do it!

275
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,751
Miyagawa has grasped the gist.

276
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,083
Like this. Beat Fishing.

277
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,167
And then pull it up,

278
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,584
Mach Detaching.

279
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,167
He learnt it with
a terribly fast speed.

280
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:31,918
Okay.

281
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,626
Mach Detaching.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,999
He's so skilled!

283
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,834
Mach Detaching.

284
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:39,918
Mach Detaching.

285
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,375
I think I can fight like this.

286
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,375
Lastly, when I compete
against the champion,

287
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,709
please give me some advice.

288
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,209
When you catch scallops,

289
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,584
you can each use one water tank.
 Yes.

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,584
Use as much of it as you can.
 I see.

291
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,959
Mr Kobayashi, you want to defeat
the champion too, right?

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,876
I do.

293
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,667
I'll carry your wish,

294
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:03,292
and defeat the champion!
 Thank you!

295
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:06,292
The time of battle has come.

296
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:07,626
Call the champion!

297
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,292
The World Scallop Fishing
Championship's

298
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,584
three times champion,

299
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,042
Ms Sasagawa!

300
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,500
So cool!

301
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:17,542
What?

302
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,876
What...

303
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,751
They got the wrong one?

304
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:22,709
What?

305
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,292
That's right,

306
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,375
this is the threetime champion

307
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,042
of the World Scallop Fishing
Championship,

308
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:32,334
the absolute champion in
the hall of fame, Harumi Sasagawa.

309
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,459
I assumed it was a gentleman.

310
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,542
I thought it was an old man.

311
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:37,751
People always say that.

312
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,250
When did you participate
for the first time?

313
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:43,209
It was in 2011.
 2011.

314
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,709
You participated for the first time,

315
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,000
and became the champion?
 Yes.

316
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:47,959
What?

317
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,292
Why are you so good
at fishing scallops?

318
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,375
I practised secretly,

319
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,792
I think nobody else practised
at that time.

320
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,167
How do you practise?

321
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:04,375
I restore the scallops I've eaten
to their original state...

322
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,999
But isn't it difficult?
It doesn't bite.

323
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:12,000
The shell opens to a certain extent,
doesn't it?

324
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,834
I make some easy ones,

325
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,959
and some that are closing
and difficult to catch,

326
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,626
and practised by inserting the hook.

327
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,584
Wow... that's impressive!

328
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,584
We're on different levels.

329
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,042
Let's do it.

330
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,334
Toyoura Scallop Fishing
World Championship,

331
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,500
special version,

332
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,000
starts now.

333
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:39,751
The Toyoura Scallop Fishing
World Championship has started.

334
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,709
If Miyagawa wins, he'll get
a year's worth of scallops.

335
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,999
If the champion wins,

336
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,500
she'll get a happi vest
with Miyagawa's autograph.

337
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,417
The match will kick off soon.

338
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,250
You'll have three minutes.

339
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,709
Ready, fight!

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,542
It starts now!

341
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:01,167
First, Miyagawa goes for
a small scallop.

342
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,000
Wow, he already pulled one up!

343
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,792
What about the champion?

344
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,083
She pulled one up.

345
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:13,542
But Miyagawa is catching
scallops too! He's in the lead!

346
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:16,709
He wants to put a gap between them,

347
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:19,375
Miyagawa doesn't go for
scallops that don't react.

348
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,626
A good tactic!

349
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,876
Oh! It came off!

350
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,042
Stay calm.

351
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,918
The venue is enveloped in silence.

352
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,876
The champion is catching up
to Miyagawa.

353
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,834
Do your best!
 You can do it!

354
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,500
But she's caught one!

355
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,334
Miyagawa isn't beaten!

356
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,999
Miyagawa is currently in the lead.

357
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,167
How about this?

358
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,834
He pulled this up!

359
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:44,042
I'm impressed.

360
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,959
Will Miyagawa go for one more?
Can he?

361
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,959
Oh, it came off!

362
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:51,375
The condition is good.

363
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,292
One minute passed.

364
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,584
One minute passed.

365
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,834
Don't get impatient.

366
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,918
The champion is catching up too.

367
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,876
The advanceandretreat continues.

368
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,959
It's a good match!

369
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,751
Miyagawa wants to catch one more!

370
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:05,667
You can do it!

371
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,083
Beat Fishing,

372
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,542
then Mach Detaching!

373
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,042
He made it!

374
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,209
It's amazing.

375
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,167
But the champion is catching up.

376
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,584
No wonder she's the champion.

377
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:19,417
Miyagawa puts the hook into
the scallop's opening carefully.

378
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,584
This is the difficult part.

379
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,876
It bit! It bit!

380
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,542
Ah! It dropped!

381
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,876
But who would've thought
this would happen?

382
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,459
Miyagawa is cornering the champion.

383
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,876
He caught another one!

384
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,459
Champion... Oh, it dropped!

385
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:41,167
Now, Miyagawa has a chance to win!

386
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,375
The champion caught one.

387
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,709
Miyagawa does Beat Fishing!

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,584
Beat Fishing, and...

389
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,959
Mach... Oh, he can't take it off!

390
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,292
It's stuck there!

391
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,834
There's less than one minute left.

392
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:59,626
At whom will the goddess
of victory smile?

393
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,584
The champion caught one again!

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,167
Miyagawa's hand is shaking!

395
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,250
His hand is shaking and can't put
the hook into the scallop well.

396
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,417
My hand is shaking.

397
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,667
It's shaking, as you can see.

398
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,709
Can he catch it?

399
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:16,834
He pulled it up!

400
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,792
30 seconds left.

401
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,209
It's the last spurt!

402
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,125
Now the champion pulls one up!

403
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:30,209
That's why she is called a legend.

404
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,375
And then...

405
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,834
Two in a row!

406
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,751
Miyagawa's hook doesn't go in!

407
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:38,709
10 seconds left.

408
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:39,792
He's panicking.

409
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:43,834
Instead of Miyagawa,
the champion catches up quickly.

410
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,751
The champion caught one again.

411
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,000
The match is over now.

412
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:52,417
I don't know...

413
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,292
It was a good match.
 What's the result?

414
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,626
Did I lose?

415
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,250
No idea. No idea.

416
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,709
We'll announce the result.

417
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,834
Champion Sasagawa
caught 12 scallops.

418
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:06,751
Impressive.

419
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,999
The champion caught 12 scallops.

420
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,626
And Miyagawa...

421
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,918
Mr Miyagawa's record is...

422
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,125
eight scallops.

423
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,000
It's so frustrating!

424
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,626
The champion won!

425
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,542
Oh? Oh?

426
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,792
I feel so frustrated!

427
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,626
Champion, what does festival
mean to you?

428
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:33,083
It didn't occur to me I could be
the champion three times in a row,

429
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,459
so I thought the effort I made
wasn't wasted.

430
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:39,542
Indeed, it's important
to make effort and practise.

431
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,792
That shows in the real match.

432
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,584
Our town's fishermen spend
their lives nurturing the scallops,

433
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,000
that's why we can use them
to hold the championship.

434
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,959
Our whole region will use
the festival to tell the world

435
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,292
how good Toyoura Town is,

436
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,167
we'll continue to do our best.

437
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,167
That's right.

438
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,959
Thank you so much.

439
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,876
It was a wonderful festival.

440
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,709
The next place he goes to is...

441
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,125
Wasshoi!

442
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,334
The place I have come to

443
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:12,292
is Innoshima, Onomichi City,
Hiroshima Prefecture.

444
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,500
This place is wonderful!

445
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,459
Our guide

446
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,959
is Oyama Shrine's chief priest,
Mr Takashi Makihata.

447
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,834
Is this a dangerous festival?

448
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,876
It isn't dangerous,

449
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,250
but the ability to balance
is important.

450
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,751
I only have a bad feeling
about this.

451
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:36,500
They go to Oyama Shrine,
the stage of the battle.

452
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,209
Mr Miyagawa.
 Yes.

453
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,042
Have a look at that.

454
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:42,918
What?

455
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,250
What did Miyagawa see there?

456
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,417
Mr Miyagawa.
 Yes.

457
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:49,999
Have a look at that.

458
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,792
What?

459
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:56,334
What did Miyagawa see there?

460
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,167
What?

461
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,167
A man riding a bicycle
slowly on a board.

462
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:05,250
This is
the Bicycle Shrine Festival's

463
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,209
Slow Log Bridge Race.

464
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:12,209
Participants cycle slowly on a board
without falling,

465
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:14,459
and they'll compete their time
against each other's.

466
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,876
Oyama Shrine here

467
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:20,959
is the oldest shrine in Innoshima,
it was built in 773.

468
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,042
It brings safety to traffic,

469
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,459
and cyclists who cycle around
the Seto Inland Sea visit here,

470
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,500
so it is called Bicycle Shrine.

471
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:36,542
The Bicycle Shrine Festival is held
annually to celebrate the deity.

472
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,792
It's here.

473
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:41,250
It's eight metres long.
 Eight metres.

474
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:45,918
The log bridge is eight metres long,
which is good luck in Japan.

475
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,542
It is about 25 centimetres wide.

476
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:54,000
How slowly did the last time's
champion cycle?

477
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,125
It was 8.63 seconds.

478
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,709
8.63 seconds.
 Yes.

479
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,999
So it's one metre per second?
 Yes.

480
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,125
It's quite difficult.

481
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:05,876
Is that so? After what you said,

482
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,667
I thought maybe I could do it.

483
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,792
Now, he will practise.

484
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:16,000
We prepared four kinds of bicycles
for him this time.

485
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,375
Can I try them one by one?

486
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,542
He'll start from the city bicycle.

487
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:26,626
Miyagawa tries the Slow Log Bridge
the first time.

488
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,167
Will he be able to do it?

489
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:32,999
Oh, it's difficult.

490
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,584
It fell down the board.

491
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,209
The shrine has a bit of a slope.

492
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:42,125
I'm climbing up slightly.

493
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,292
It's so hot.

494
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,584
The temperature is 35 degrees,

495
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,834
and he tries the other bicycles too.

496
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,542
This is difficult.

497
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,584
Wow, it's so difficult.

498
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,709
It's so difficult!

499
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,375
Wow...

500
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,209
It's what chimpanzees ride.

501
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,792
By the way, this bicycle...

502
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,584
is the Chief Priest's granddaughter
Aoi's bicycle.

503
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:12,542
But this bicycle will make
an incredible record.

504
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:13,876
It's amazing.

505
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,999
Isn't he doing well?

506
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,167
Wow.

507
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,584
Isn't this good?

508
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:21,918
9.50 seconds.

509
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:26,584
He made an unprecedented record
of 9.50 seconds.

510
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,876
It's surprisingly easy
to balance on this.

511
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,334
Even if I pedal,

512
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:34,042
the wheels are small,
so it doesn't go forward much.

513
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,459
I can do it by finetuning this.

514
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:39,959
But...

515
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:44,167
If I use this and win,

516
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,626
won't I look bad?

517
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:51,292
Which bicycle will Miyagawa use
in the race?

518
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,626
The time of battle has come.

519
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,584
I'm getting exhausted in this heat,

520
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,042
but in the final match,

521
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,209
I'll cycle slowly once.

522
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,542
Please ask the champion to come.

523
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,709
Champion of Slow Log Bridge Race,

524
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:12,792
Mr Ichimura!

525
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,876
Here he is! Wow!

526
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,125
He is tanned.

527
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,375
Nice to meet you.

528
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:25,167
This is the record keeper of
the longest time on the log bridge,

529
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,834
Champion, Osamu Ichimura.

530
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:32,375
Do you usually ride a bicycle?

531
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:34,209
I cycle every day.
 Every day!

532
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,459
Do you participate every time?
 Well...

533
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,209
I happened to participate
and happened to win.

534
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,125
Wow!

535
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,999
Today, safety comes first too.

536
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,292
Looking forward to it.
 Okay, let's have a match.

537
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,876
I'm looking forward to it.

538
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,918
Let's do it. Slow Log Bridge Race,
special version,

539
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
starts now.

540
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,999
Let's do it. Slow Log Bridge Race,
special version,

541
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,459
starts now.

542
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,918
I will explain the rule.

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,334
On the eightmetreslong board,

544
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,042
they'll compete to see
who cycles more slowly.

545
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,459
If Miyagawa wins,
he'll get a Setouchi cyclewear.

546
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,334
The champion will go first.

547
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,542
How will he cycle?

548
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:16,500
Do your best.

549
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,292
It'll start
when the taiko drum stops.

550
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,584
It's a moment of nervousness.

551
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,792
Now, start!

552
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:29,999
He got on the log bridge.
It's fast too!

553
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,876
He brakes and holds out.

554
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,000
Alright.
 He reaches the goal now.

555
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,918
His record is 4.08 seconds.

556
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,709
Is he nervous?

557
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,876
Miyagawa, this is your chance!

558
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,125
Okay, let's go!

559
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:46,042
The champion's time
was only half of last time's.

560
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,999
But there's also a chance he'll fall
from the board and be disqualified.

561
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:53,584
Which bicycle will he choose?

562
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,500
Oh, it's Aoi's bicycle!

563
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,042
Aoi, I'll borrow this!

564
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:01,876
Besides his victory, he also wants
to achieve a great record.

565
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,959
After all, the champion's time
was four seconds.

566
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,667
The video will be boring
if he just wins.

567
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,334
Now, Miyagawa...

568
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,334
Now, it's the fateful start!

569
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,375
He's slow!

570
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,292
He gets on the board.

571
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,459
He's keeping his balance.
 It's over if he falls.

572
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,167
Will he get a miraculous 10 seconds?

573
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,375
Can he?

574
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:26,417
Don't fall!

575
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,792
Miyagawa just crossed the goal!

576
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:29,959
How was it?

577
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:32,918
The result is...

578
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,667
How was it?

579
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,584
7.62 seconds.
 Yay!

580
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:41,167
7.62 seconds, Miyagawa wins!

581
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,667
But there was nothing
worth mentioning.

582
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,459
Thank you.
 Thank you.

583
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,542
Thank you.
 I admit defeat.

584
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:54,209
This time,
it's one win and one loss.

585
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,999
Thank you, everyone!

586
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:57,959
You know, Champion...

587
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:02,000
We were boring
when we were competing.

588
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,959
That's all for
Way to Japanese Festivals.

589
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,999
Thank you.

590
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,209
It looked like you met an uncle
you haven't seen for a while

591
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,209
and cycled with him.

592
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,292
No!

593
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:16,626
The champion was very nervous.

594
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:19,167
We were surprised too.

595
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,792
His speed...
 We were watching,

596
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:23,334
and were wondering
how much time we should give him,

597
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:25,417
but he just went
and cycled on the board.

598
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,209
When the champion's time
was four seconds,

599
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,584
I thought you'd choose
another bicycle.

600
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:35,125
No, because I lost
the scallop match.

601
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,959
The scallop match too!

602
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,167
What?

603
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,584
Hold on, you have to complain
about the scallop too?

604
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,250
Well...
 What?

605
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,876
The video was edited like you were
going to win till halfway.

606
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,626
You were catching them quickly,

607
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,834
and when they lined
the eight scallops up,

608
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:52,834
Mr Degawa and I went,
"I think he caught more?"

609
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,792
"I think he caught more?"

610
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,709
It... it wasn't me,

611
00:25:56,792 --> 00:26:00,000
complain to the director
who did the editing.

612
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,167
But that's a television show.

613
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:05,292
If you show the actual video,

614
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,459
I was losing in the last minute
in the second half.

615
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,375
My opponent was making
sounds like "Boom! Boom!"

616
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:15,667
I heard the sound of scallops
going into the bucket many times.

617
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,667
I knew she caught more than me.

618
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,834
There's nothing to complain about.

619
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:22,999
But your hand shook.

620
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,417
You weren't irritating it,
your hand was shaking.

621
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,751
No...

622
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,417
No, I was doing the Beat Fishing.

623
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,918
You've been Beat Fishing
before you put the hook in.

624
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:37,417
He's been Beat Fishing
before putting the hook in.

625
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,500
You caught them quietly.

626
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:42,250
No sign of getting a yellow scallop.

627
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,167
Just quietly.

628
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:47,083
You went, "I can do it..."
and caught them.

629
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,542
I wanted to play games like that.

630
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:51,584
They have so many things to say.

631
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,584
I feel frustrated.
 And you, Tetchan?

632
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,167
Well, the conclusion is,

633
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,834
even I can win
in the bicycle festival.

634
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,292
Three hours by bullet train
and car from Tokyo,

635
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,667
Asako Ito's Mystery Tour in Nara.

636
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:09,709
Hey.

637
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,542
You must be wondering!

638
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,999
Speaking of wondering,

639
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:16,918
the other day,
Miss Okubo said to me,

640
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:19,999
"Oh, Asako,
your "society's window" is open."

641
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:23,083
I looked, and it was open,
so I went, "Oh no!"

642
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,834
I glanced when I was zipping it,

643
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,999
and saw Miss Okubo's
"society's window" was also open.

644
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,000
You must be wondering!

645
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,792
Explanation of Asako's
dead language, "society window."

646
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:38,834
People from the Showa era describe
the state of an open zipper

647
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,959
as "the society's window is open."

648
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:45,334
She has come
to the World Heritage in Nara,

649
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,250
Todaiji Temple, as everyone knows.

650
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,792
It's so cool!

651
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,334
It's so overwhelming.

652
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:58,209
The statue is 14.98 metres tall,
it's Nara's Great Buddha.

653
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,459
It's really impressive.

654
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:01,709
In the Nara period 1,300 years ago,

655
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,042
an actual seven years
were spent to erect this.

656
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,375
So cute! So cute...

657
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,542
She talks to the monk, Mr Tsutsui.

658
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:12,709
It's said that at that time,

659
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:16,375
the number of people involved
in building this Todaiji Temple

660
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,584
was 2.6 million.

661
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,334
2.6 million?
 Yes.

662
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:22,500
It's about half of the population
at that time.

663
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:25,292
Half of Japan's population
gathered at Nara?

664
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,209
Yes.

665
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,459
Maybe your ancestor

666
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,751
was also involved
in building the Buddha statue.

667
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:34,999
So we'll give you a quiz
on the Buddha.

668
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:39,626
Have a look at the Buddha statue.
At the centre of its forehead,

669
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,709
there's something like
a mole or a wart.

670
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,999
What is it?

671
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,459
Mr Degawa, please answer.
 What?

672
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:49,375
Me?

673
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:53,375
Well... something like
Ultraman's Colour Timer?

674
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:55,959
We'll now announce
the correct answer.

675
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,918
It's white hair called Urna.

676
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,999
Its kanji character
is the difficult version.

677
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:04,959
When he was thinking hard about
how to achieve enlightenment,

678
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,584
his hair here hardened
and became that shape.

679
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:11,500
The hair on his head also hardened
by wisdom in the same way,

680
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,042
and it is called Rahotsu.

681
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:18,667
My curly hair gets more and more
curly every year,

682
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:21,292
and it's gradually getting frizzly.

683
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:23,876
It shows that you have wisdom.

684
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,083
There are many theories.

685
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,999
The Mystery Tour in Nara starts!

686
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:35,209
Go wild! Pupils from the whole
country rush to this training hall.

687
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,292
This is the training hall.

688
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,375
What? Souvenir shop?

689
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:41,417
Hello.
 Welcome.

690
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,292
He has the scooper in his hand
when he welcomes me.

691
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,667
This is a goldfish scooping
training hall.

692
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:52,959
Yamatokoriyama City here is
a big production area of goldfish.

693
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,792
So goldfish scooping thrives,

694
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:58,334
a world championship
is held every summer.

695
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:00,000
Wow!

696
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,834
It currently has over 400 pupils.

697
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:06,417
Among them, there are strong people
who are ranked.

698
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:10,375
They are the Ito Sisters, who are
1stdan and 3rddan respectively.

699
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,918
Do you both like goldfish scooping?

700
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:13,834
Yes.

701
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:16,626
Let the rank holders
show us their true abilities.

702
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,375
How many can they scoop
in three minutes?

703
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:20,709
They're so calm!

704
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,751
What? They're so calm!

705
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,751
Why doesn't the scooper break?

706
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:29,584
Even in the goldfish scooping
world championship,

707
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,125
the Ito Sisters rank high.

708
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,584
They polish their skill
at the training hall every day.

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,709
Three, two, one, stop.

710
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:43,209
They scooped this many
in three minutes.

711
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,959
Let's count the number.

712
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,292
44.
 Wow.

713
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,459
44.

714
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,792
Oh, it's the same!

715
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:52,626
They can scoop one
every four, five seconds.

716
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,375
When Asako tries to scoop...

717
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,083
If it breaks in the centre,
it shows you're bad at it.

718
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,667
Aren't you harsh on someone
who does it the first time?

719
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:08,334
They teach us the basics
of goldfish scooping.

720
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,334
When you put the scooper in water,

721
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:11,999
do it at an angle,

722
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:13,918
which won't strain the paper.

723
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:17,250
Put it in at an angle,
go under a goldfish,

724
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,959
make it flat, then you can catch it.

725
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,042
When you lift it up,
do it at an angle.

726
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,626
That's all for the basics.

727
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,125
If you can do this, you can scoop
so many goldfish that it's funny.

728
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:33,792
Ms Ito, you want to scoop
the goldfish so much,

729
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:36,042
that they can feel the frenzy.

730
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,751
Don't say it's frenzy.

731
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,709
Asako will try to do the firstdan
certification examination.

732
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:46,626
She'll pass if she can scoop
10 in one minute.

733
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,334
It'll be boring if you just do it,

734
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:50,417
so if you can't pass,
you'll bungeejump.

735
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,667
That's awful!

736
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,918
Come on,
they're two different things.

737
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,834
It's awful, right?
You feel sorry for me, right?

738
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,959
Tell him you feel sorry for Asako.

739
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,167
Ready, go.

740
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,918
Miss Asako, do your best!

741
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,083
She's ranked as a comedian.

742
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:11,000
Let's do it, then!

743
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,417
Ready, go!

744
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,999
You can do it!
 Do your best!

745
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,209
Asako has a good start
and scooped one.

746
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:18,709
Then the second one.

747
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,083
You can do it!

748
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,792
Three in a row.

749
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,459
She hides her frenzy
and scooped the fourth.

750
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,584
Wow...

751
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,709
She becomes firstdan
if she scoops 10.

752
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,876
If she can't, she'll bungeejump.

753
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:33,751
At that time...

754
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,334
Ah! No! No!

755
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:42,250
Please let me do it once more!

756
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,751
They feel sorry
for the middleaged lady.

757
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,999
She can't scoop anymore.

758
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,918
It's over.

759
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,584
I practised so much...

760
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:54,167
No! I don't want to do this!

761
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:56,042
I look forward to watching the show.

762
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,999
You must be wondering...

763
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:03,959
So...

764
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,292
I won't look down.

765
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,542
Really?

766
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,459
Asako is at...

767
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,042
30 metres above the ground,

768
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,375
the only Bridge Bungee in Kansai
built on the approach to a shrine.

769
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:19,500
It's called Goodluck Bungee.

770
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,083
You can do it!

771
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,417
They're nice. They're all so nice.

772
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:29,167
The whole audience
is cheering for her.

773
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:31,834
Can I do it?
 You can!

774
00:33:31,918 --> 00:33:33,459
Five, four, three, two, one.

775
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,751
She jumped.

776
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,709
The Goodluck Bungee is successful!

777
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,876
The whole audience praises her.

778
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:45,125
Sorry for taking up your time.

779
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,500
Thank you.

780
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,375
You measure your weight?

781
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,751
Why?
 It's pointless!

782
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:53,417
The whole audience teases her.

783
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,459
I thought I lost weight after that.

784
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,834
We'll now introduce
the wonderful traditional culture

785
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,999
of the neighbouring
Wakayama Prefecture.

786
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:03,959
We've come to Kitayama Village.

787
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,918
On the water, it's a cedar raft
that looks like a train.

788
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,042
It's 30 metres long in total,

789
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,209
this is Kitayama Village's
traditional rafting.

790
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:17,000
Originally, it was a way
to transport timber,

791
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,792
and go down this river.

792
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,250
In the Edo period,

793
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:24,584
Kitayama Village was a major
production area of Japanese cedar.

794
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:29,334
Rafting is a traditional culture
that has existed for 600 years.

795
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,876
Rafter Asako will experience
the wonderful skill.

796
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,042
It suits her.

797
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:37,584
She encountered the rapids
right after it started.

798
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,209
Is this okay? What should I do?

799
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:43,167
The 30 metres long raft charges.

800
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,584
I'm scared...

801
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,209
Be careful. Hold it... It's coming!

802
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,500
It's coming! No!

803
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:52,959
It hit my crotch!

804
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,999
No!

805
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:56,959
It hit my crotch.

806
00:34:57,626 --> 00:35:00,709
The raft weaves its way
through the rapids.

807
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,250
It's coming again...

808
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,292
Be careful.

809
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,999
No!
 The drone is doing a good job.

810
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,000
It's amazing!

811
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,167
The men in front
are controlling the raft.

812
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:22,000
He skilfully handles the tiller

813
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,542
and controls the raft.

814
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:27,500
They go past a sharp turn
without bumping into it.

815
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,876
The raft behind follows,
just like a train.

816
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,626
It's a proficient skill
against mother nature.

817
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:42,500
There is a secret spot
at the valley in Wakayama.

818
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,417
The mysterious valley
where people yell.

819
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,709
Ooh!

820
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:49,709
Oh?

821
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,042
It's something that
I mustn't go near.

822
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:57,626
Next, it's a mysterious valley
where people yell.

823
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:59,751
Ooh!

824
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:00,792
Oh?

825
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:03,876
It's something
that I mustn't go near.

826
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,667
This is the person
who made the sound.

827
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,626
Hello.

828
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,792
Why did this gentleman yell?

829
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:17,083
It's the place you hear echoes
most beautifully in Japan.

830
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,083
Oh, indeed!

831
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,209
That's right.

832
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:24,042
"The place in Japan where
echoes come back most clearly."

833
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:28,167
This is Tsubakiyama Dam
in Hidakagawa Town,

834
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:32,292
it's the place in Japan
where echoes are the clearest.

835
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,459
Asako yells at once.

836
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,375
Yoohoo!

837
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:37,667
Yoohoo!

838
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,500
Wow!

839
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:43,125
It echoed three times!
I was on the opposite side!

840
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,667
I was there!

841
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:45,834
I was there!

842
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,125
Wow!
 Isn't this amazing?

843
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:49,250
Isn't it amazing?
 Interesting!

844
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,209
It's different from
the echo I imagined.

845
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,125
The words are so clear.

846
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,375
Echo occurs when sound is reflected
by mountains or valleys.

847
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,542
The requirements for a clear echo

848
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:03,125
are that there should be no obstacle
in front of the target,

849
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:05,584
and the distance
should be 300 metres.

850
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:09,834
Also, if the target
is a parabola like this,

851
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:11,626
it collects sound effectively.

852
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,667
This is the "Yoohoo point"
that fulfils both requirements.

853
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,417
One day!

854
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,959
One day!

855
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,584
In the forest!

856
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,999
In the forest!

857
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:23,667
I met...

858
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:25,083
I met...

859
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:26,709
A bear!

860
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,209
A bear!

861
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,292
It's sung beautifully in rounds.

862
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:35,417
But Asako is careless
and forgot to check something.

863
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:38,459
It's going to be a basic question.
 Yes.

864
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,042
Who are you?

865
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,375
Me?
 Sorry, I forgot to ask.

866
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,000
I just talked normally.

867
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,167
Well, it's a sad story.

868
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,751
There's an Echo Competition.

869
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:50,834
What's the standard?

870
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,417
Is it how beautifully it echoes?

871
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,667
Yes, that's the first thing.

872
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:55,626
And there's one more thing.

873
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,459
It's the comedy element.
You need a sense of humour.

874
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,792
Humour!

875
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,959
I'm the first runnerup.

876
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,667
Isn't it sad? I'm not the winner.

877
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:08,667
Mr Kobata, will you show us
your ability as the first runnerup?

878
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:09,709
Okay, I'll do it.

879
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:13,292
The head judge was over there.

880
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,459
The mayor?

881
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,959
His head was shiny.
 Shiny. Okay.

882
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:19,792
Bright and shiny!

883
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:21,876
Bright and shiny!

884
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:25,751
He got the second place
without making the mayor smile.

885
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:30,459
Then they started to shout what was
on their own mind at that place.

886
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:33,626
My waist is...

887
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,999
88.8!

888
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:40,918
It's an auspicious number.

889
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,459
It's what Wakayama Prefecture's
people think during the pandemic.

890
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,876
I want to visit Osaka!

891
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,417
I want to visit Osaka!
 A yell from his heart.

892
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,792
You want to go to Osaka?
 Yes.

893
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,167
But I can't.

894
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,792
Then, it's Assistant Producer
Morikawa's turn.

895
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,834
I want to go back
to my parents' home!

896
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:02,542
I want to go home!
 Nice.

897
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:04,834
It's desperate.
 It is.

898
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,334
Then, our cameraman Yamamoto.

899
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,792
Blood pressure, go lower!

900
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,959
Blood pressure, go lower!

901
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,417
Is it a bit high?
 It is.

902
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,667
It's about 150 over 100.
 It's high!

903
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,375
Each of them is high.

904
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,375
Get my pension this year!

905
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,125
Get my pension!

906
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,042
Get what?
 My pension.

907
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,375
Oh, Gramps, is that so?

908
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,709
Oh, wow!

909
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,209
Then, it's
Assistant Director Iwai's turn.

910
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,542
I want a boyfriend!

911
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,542
It doesn't echo for some reason.

912
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,250
So weak! Your voice is so weak!

913
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,250
You used a megaphone!

914
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:46,918
Next, it's technology in Nara.

915
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:48,751
Most advanced!

916
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,334
A research laboratory
that makes tools of the future.

917
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:56,209
We've come to Nara Institute
of Science and Technology.

918
00:39:56,751 --> 00:40:00,083
This laboratory mainly uses VR

919
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,292
to study how to deceive
the human five senses.

920
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,250
Student, Mr Yoshimitsu
will tell us about it.

921
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,459
The goal of this
is to relieve stress,

922
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,959
it's a research on the sense
of touch to tickle yourself.

923
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,292
It's a serious research

924
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,999
that studies how to tickle yourself
to get rid of stress.

925
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,709
It's called...
 Tickle Me.

926
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:23,709
Tickle Me.

927
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,250
The nuance is suddenly different.

928
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,459
When you wear the VR goggles,

929
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:32,292
a girl comes close to tickle you.

930
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,375
Combined with the sound
and the video,

931
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:37,999
the glove that expands and shrinks

932
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,999
can let you tickle yourself.

933
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:44,083
Many people want to be tickled
like this.

934
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,209
She is ready.

935
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:50,918
I don't feel anything yet, though.

936
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,751
Let's begin, then.
 Okay.

937
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,417
But in Asako's case...

938
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:56,709
Oh!

939
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,751
"Tanma..." I'm scared!
 What's wrong?

940
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,918
She's tickled like this by the girl
without using the gloves.

941
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,709
You're too close! No!

942
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,918
What's wrong with her? Go away!

943
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,918
No!

944
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,292
Stop saying "tickle!"

945
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:16,000
The gloves they did much research on
are crying.

946
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,083
Someone... oh?

947
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:20,999
It's over.

948
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:22,250
It's over.

949
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:24,876
What?
 Miss Asako.

950
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,918
The girl came straight to me.

951
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,999
Miss Asako, that's not the purpose.

952
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,626
She got too close
and I don't like it.

953
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:35,999
I don't want anyone in my area.

954
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:39,918
That girl went, "Tickle, tickle..."

955
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,292
What do you think about the result?

956
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,709
It's too unique.

957
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:45,667
What?

958
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:48,626
Here, we'll explain
Asako's dead language again.

959
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,999
"Tanma"... I'm scared!

960
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:55,918
People in the Showa era say "tanma"
when they mean "wait a minute,"

961
00:41:56,209 --> 00:42:00,584
One theory says it was derived
from "time out" said with an accent.

962
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,918
Tanma... I'm scared!

963
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:07,584
Lastly, it's a robot that holds
a Guinness World Record.

964
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,042
Regular participant of the National
Technology College Robot Contest,

965
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:13,918
Nara National Institute
of Technology has the robot.

966
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:16,751
Nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.

967
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,250
They are the students.

968
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:22,167
This is the robot.

969
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,292
It's so cute!

970
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,751
The Guinness World Record
he holds is...

971
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:35,375
Hang on! It's more impressive
than I thought!

972
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:37,709
It's long rope jumping.

973
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:41,918
Its record
is 106 times in one minute.

974
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,792
It's a penguin robot
made for jumping.

975
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:48,334
Its name is Jumpen.

976
00:42:48,918 --> 00:42:50,209
How does he jump?

977
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:52,459
It detects the skipping rope,

978
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:53,459
stretches his leg...

979
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:54,959
Oh, it stretches!
 Yes.

980
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,834
After that, it's pulled in suddenly.

981
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,584
The sensor in the upper part
detects the rope.

982
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:04,500
Instead of jumping, the stretched
leg brings the body up,

983
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,584
then crosses the rope
by pulling the leg back suddenly.

984
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:11,042
The level of completion is brilliant
and was highly praised.

985
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:14,209
Instead of people matching a robot
that jumps singlemindedly,

986
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,459
he senses the rope and moves.

987
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,999
Now, they'll try
to create a new record.

988
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:24,500
I don't think there's a record
of a person jumping with a robot.

989
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,209
There isn't any yet?
 No.

990
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,042
Probably the world's first,

991
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:31,584
a person and a robot will try
long rope jumping together.

992
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,042
Asako and Jumpen.

993
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:36,125
How many times can they jump?

994
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:37,125
Do your best!

995
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:42,459
Five, four, three, two, one.

996
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:43,918
Start.

997
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:47,751
Wow...

998
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,417
Look, in human history,

999
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,292
this is the first time a person
is skipping rope with a robot.

1000
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,209
Amazing.
 He's cute.

1001
00:43:57,918 --> 00:43:59,000
A bit to the front.

1002
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:02,042
But actually,
before they come this far,

1003
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:04,542
it had been a series
of twists and turns.

1004
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:05,709
Start.

1005
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:08,709
"Practising"

1006
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,500
Wait, I'm sorry...

1007
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:13,876
The timing Jumpen and Asako jump
are different,

1008
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:15,417
so it's difficult to sync.

1009
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,417
I see.

1010
00:44:17,209 --> 00:44:18,125
Oh, sorry.

1011
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:21,792
What should I do? I'll be too late
if I jump twice in between.

1012
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:26,375
If it's once, it hurts my knees
and it's painful.

1013
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:28,542
To match Jumpen's pace,

1014
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:32,083
Asako jumps slightly
in between each jump,

1015
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,999
but it hurts her knees greatly.

1016
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,626
Don't make it sound so serious.

1017
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:38,834
My bone... my bone...

1018
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:40,876
It hurts my bone.

1019
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:43,918
I can't stand...
 Not "Kite."

1020
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,375
It isn't "Kite" here!
 Thank you.

1021
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:50,459
Jumpen will be full of energy again
after the battery is changed,

1022
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:54,500
but Asako's knees won't be back.

1023
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:55,626
Oh, there!

1024
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:58,042
Thank you, Gramps.

1025
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:00,209
We need you to do your best.

1026
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,375
An old person caring for another.

1027
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,999
They practised for two whole hours.

1028
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:08,667
"Making the record"

1029
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:12,667
30 seconds after it started,
Asako can't lift up her knees.

1030
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:13,918
You can do it.

1031
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:18,042
Now it depends on how long
Asako's battery will last.

1032
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,042
Don't use "Kite" here!

1033
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,209
Oh, sorry!

1034
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,584
It's over here.

1035
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:32,042
How many times?

1036
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:34,334
What is the record?

1037
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:35,751
It's 51 times.

1038
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,334
51.

1039
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,125
Thank you.

1040
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:43,999
Oh, that's my age.

1041
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,292
This is auspicious.

1042
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,500
Thank you.

1043
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:49,584
Don't use it like that!

1044
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:50,999
I jumped the number of times
of my age.

1045
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,209
Don't use that song!

1046
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:56,250
That's all for Asako's Mystery Tour.
