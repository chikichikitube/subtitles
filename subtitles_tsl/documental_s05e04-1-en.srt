1
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:17,867
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:22,233
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:28,567
When a comedian gets married,
the reception gets really lively.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,100
Everyone tries their best
to make the guests laugh.

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,100
Say cheese!

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,266
Okay!

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,066
Can I have one more?

8
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:42,500
But for some reason,
I don't do well in situations like that.

9
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:46,800
This show is like a wedding reception,
but the people who usually laugh,

10
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,333
the bride and her family, aren't there.

11
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,000
Nori-ka?

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,700
-"Norika"?
-No, no.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
That's his ex!

14
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,467
You definitely said it.

15
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:00,467
I've seen every season of this show.
I love ego searching.

16
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:06,100
People always write about who they want
to see in the next season of Documental.

17
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,567
My name always pops up.

18
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,500
Apple pen!

19
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,333
I couldn't understand why
I wasn't called up earlier.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,467
Well, here I am.

21
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,834
Here I am!

22
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,700
I usually play off other people
to create my humor.

23
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,834
So I imagine that's how
it will work here, too.

24
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,033
Whenever somebody does something,

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,467
or whenever somebody does something wrong,

26
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,133
I'll be there to join in.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,433
Since you like fishing,
do you prefer fish sausages?

28
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,867
-I guess so.
-Yes, I do.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,367
-You do?
-Rather than German ones.

30
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,400
You prefer fish?

31
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,200
All I want
is for people to think I'm funny.

32
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:03,066
That's the tough thing
about this competition.

33
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:07,533
You pay a million yen to be in a room
where nobody ever says you're funny.

34
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:21,200
CONTESTANTS ELIMINATED SO FAR:
JIMMY ONISHI, KENJI TAMURA

35
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,133
He got me.

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,200
Orange card!

37
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,233
"Don't put your arms...

38
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,600
around my waist."

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,834
That's a double penalty.

40
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,100
-You put that much on?
-What is this?

41
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,867
What a well-behaved penis.

42
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,600
It's a clever penis.

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,567
Red!

44
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,266
Are we on?

45
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,467
Don't you need more?

46
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:25,934
-Do I?
-The leftover wax is enough?

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,867
The leftover wax should be enough.

48
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,667
-It works better with more wax.
-You're kidding.

49
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,100
But it's too hard now.

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,300
Really?

51
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,033
The paper won't stick to it.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,166
I see.

53
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,100
That hurts!

54
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,133
Ow, ow, ow.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,967
No way. That must be painful.

56
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,433
May I cover this?

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,600
May I cover this?

58
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,900
Like a Chinese zombie.

59
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,734
It's starting to look better now.

60
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,033
It hurts?

61
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,767
How could Tamura leave it so unfinished?

62
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,266
What a parting gift.

63
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,100
Next you stick the sheets on,
then rip them off.

64
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,233
Hold his hand.

65
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:12,600
Does it hurt?

66
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,567
Will that work?

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,166
-It doesn't feel like it'll work.
-I think it will.

68
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,667
-We have to try.
-Do it in one swift pull.

69
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,400
Here I go.

70
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,333
Ready...

71
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,200
Look at that!

72
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,000
So much hair came off!

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,667
"The Harmonica of Joy."

74
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,333
Hurry up and pull the other sheet.

75
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,100
-So much came off.
-It sure did.

76
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,533
That harmonica makes a beautiful sound.

77
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,000
But they did remove a lot.

78
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,767
That'll turn into a rash.

79
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,500
Does it hurt? Or not?

80
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:54,734
It hurts?

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
It hurts?

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,467
You said, "It hurts"?

83
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,533
It doesn't hurt?

84
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,133
"It hurts."

85
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:02,667
"It hurts."

86
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:03,667
Should we stop?

87
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,333
"Don't stop"?

88
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,800
-That's "Don't stop."
-Keep an eye on Takahashi.

89
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,166
You want us to do it?

90
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:11,800
"Do it"?

91
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,300
"Do it."

92
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,467
-Should we add more?
-You think so?

93
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,500
"Add more."

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,166
This is going to hurt, Koba.

95
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,600
What idiots.

96
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,333
You're putting it on his penis.
Is that okay?

97
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,266
-It's all over his penis.
-Don't wait too long.

98
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,700
Ready to try again?

99
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,633
Here goes. Ready...

100
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,767
Wait. You're grabbing his hair.

101
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
Is that okay?

102
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:37,800
He said "No!"

103
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,834
But it won't just go away.

104
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,200
Can he grab it?

105
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,633
"Just one pull."

106
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:46,967
"Just one pull."

107
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,166
"Just one pull, okay?"

108
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,533
"Just one pull, okay?"

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,867
-Let's finish this.
-Go for it.

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,567
Ready...

111
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,500
His voice skipped the harmonica
and came out as a groan.

112
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,700
Why don't we put the vibrator here?

113
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,000
If we turn it on, he'll focus on that.

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
-Wouldn't that be less painful?
-It can distract him.

115
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,667
Zakoshi is up to something.

116
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,834
Here it comes.

117
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,266
It's working.

118
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,433
-It's working.
-Yeah.

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,533
Are you ready?

120
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,667
-Ready?
-Wait. Zakoshi's here.

121
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,066
Havin' fun?

122
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,066
With this?

123
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,233
Havin' fun?

124
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,200
He freezes.

125
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,500
He suddenly freezes.

126
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,200
Hey, touch here.

127
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,600
Touch it.

128
00:07:58,734 --> 00:07:59,900
-Touch it?
-Yeah.

129
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,166
-Why?
-Just touch it.

130
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
I'm about to come.

131
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,300
Touch it.

132
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,033
Touch it.

133
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,734
I'm about to come.

134
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,233
I'm about to come.

135
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,533
I came.

136
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:37,700
He came?

137
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,934
I'm about to come.

138
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,433
I'm about to come.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,800
-Is he laughing?
-I'm about to come.

140
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,066
I'm about to come.

141
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,467
I'm about to come.

142
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
This is good.

143
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Keep going.

144
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:23,700
Keep going.

145
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm about to come.

146
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,467
That was intense.

147
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,667
Why didn't he let me come?

148
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,100
Junior never actually came.

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,967
May I make a phone call?

150
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,166
Ordering food?

151
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,834
Actually, I was supposed to call somebody
before the show started.

152
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:10,266
In this season, we'll try a new rule
that I've been contemplating for a while.

153
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
They can use a Helper.

154
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,500
Did something happen?

155
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,967
They can bring in one person.

156
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:20,033
We'll see a complete outsider
come into that space.

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,834
The Helpers will be like
Windom in Ultraseven.

158
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,633
"Capsule monsters."

159
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,767
They get to use one "capsule" each.

160
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,433
He's been asking me for advice.

161
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,367
Hello?

162
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,333
-Hello?
-Thanks for calling.

163
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:39,300
As I texted you before,
I don't think you should do it.

164
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,500
But I want one more try.

165
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,433
Who is it?

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
I don't think you can do it.

167
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,300
I think I still can. I want one more try.

168
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,166
It's too much.

169
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,767
-I can do it. I'm sure of it.
-You're the only one who thinks that.

170
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,100
I can do it. Please hear me out.

171
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,600
Can you come now?

172
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,967
Yes, I'm nearby.

173
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
My seniors are here.

174
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,600
You'll have to make it quick, okay?

175
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:05,633
-Okay.
-But I doubt I'll change my mind.

176
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,066
-I'm on my way.
-Okay. Bye.

177
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,734
-Sorry about this.
-Who is it?

178
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,467
-This guy wants my advice.
-You want him to quit?

179
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,266
I told him to give up.

180
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,300
-But he wants to do it?
-Yes.

181
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,300
Can he come in for a moment?

182
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,333
-Somebody's here.
-Who is it?

183
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
He really should give up.

184
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,734
FORMER WORLD CHAMPION BOXER IN
THREE WEIGHT CLASSES - HOZUMI HASEGAWA

185
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,467
Let me fight, just once more.

186
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,066
-You can't do it.
-I'm sure I can.

187
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,166
Listen to me.

188
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,500
We're the same age, so I know.
Our bodies have a limit.

189
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:47,567
But I still think I can do it.

190
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,567
Just once more.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,567
Then show me how well you can move.

192
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,066
Why is he asking Yamauchi?

193
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,800
I'll check your reflexes to see
how they're holding up.

194
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,166
If they seem okay, I'll think about it.

195
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,800
-Ready?
-You'll use that?

196
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,967
That's how that other boxer trains.

197
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,667
This does nothing.

198
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,367
There's no point training like this.

199
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,300
That's enough.

200
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:21,934
There's no point at all.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,500
It doesn't train anything?

202
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,000
-It's pointless.
-Pointless?

203
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,667
-Kameda always did it.
-You can still move.

204
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:30,000
Next, show me your punches. Come here.

205
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,200
One-two combo.

206
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,133
-Was Yamauchi a boxer?
-I don't think so.

207
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,100
One-two, okay?

208
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:39,834
That's it.

209
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,400
Okay.

210
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,900
Next, do a one-two, then a body blow.

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,934
Let's see if you still have it.

212
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't hold back.

213
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,767
-One-two, body blow.
-That must hurt.

214
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,133
He's hurting.

215
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:06,667
One-two, body blow.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,900
I think that's enough.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,166
-Stop it, Yamauchi.
-Yamauchi, I think--

218
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,967
I think you should let him
make a comeback.

219
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:34,967
Yamauchi?

220
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,200
Yamauchi, that's...

221
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,400
You've taken quite a beating.

222
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,066
You've made some ground.

223
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,734
-Do I still have it?
-I think you do.

224
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,567
I'll give you a call.

225
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,266
Let's talk more about making a comeback.

226
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,567
I'll be waiting.

227
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,233
Sorry for the interruption.

228
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,000
Goodbye.

229
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,633
That was Hozumi.

230
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Did you do boxing?

231
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,433
No, I didn't.

232
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,900
-Never?
-No.

233
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,600
He's nearly back in form.

234
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,967
You don't know what he was like
in his prime.

235
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,200
He wants to make a comeback.

236
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,867
This isn't a studio?

237
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,834
Sorry?

238
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,967
-A studio?
-I may have made a mistake.

239
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,734
Well, this is a studio.

240
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,467
Sorry. Who are you?

241
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,600
But this isn't a recording studio, is it?

242
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,567
-No, it's not.
-Is that so?

243
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,233
You see, I'm a musician.

244
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,433
Okay.

245
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:39,166
But you aren't musicians?

246
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,834
-No.
-We're not.

247
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,166
Is that so?

248
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:46,100
You see, I'm a freelance artist,
all the way.

249
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,767
-Okay.
-I'm not with any agency.

250
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,567
I sing whatever comes to mind.

251
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,200
You're a singer-songwriter?

252
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,934
Have you released any songs?

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,767
I have a song about order.

254
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:58,900
Order?

255
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,633
"The Song of Order."

256
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,900
-"The Song of Order"?
-It questions the proper order of things.

257
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,100
-That sounds unique.
-Maybe I know it.

258
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,000
"Do you date before having intercourse?
Or have intercourse, then date?"

259
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,100
It's about that.

260
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,667
Could you sing it for us?

261
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:17,266
Do you date before having intercourse?
Or do you have intercourse, then date?

262
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:22,600
Do you date before having intercourse?
Or do you have intercourse, then date?

263
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,000
It's about order. And the tempo.

264
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,433
Do you date before having intercourse?
Or do you have intercourse, then date?

265
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,200
"The Song of Order." The order of things.

266
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,200
-Is there more to it?
-There's more.

267
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,934
I tell a number of people's stories.

268
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,767
-You sing about order?
-I do.

269
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:46,333
Do you date before having intercourse?
Or do you have intercourse, then date?

270
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,000
-Is that the chorus?
-Exactly.

271
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:50,567
-Are there verses before and after?
-Of course.

272
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,200
What did you do after you started to date?

273
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,900
After we started dating,
we went to a hot spring

274
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,166
What did you do after the hot spring?

275
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,834
After the hot spring, we went to an inn

276
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,367
What did you do at the inn?

277
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,033
We went to the inn and had a drink

278
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,533
What did you do after having a drink?

279
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,133
You guessed it, we had intercourse

280
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Do you date before having intercourse?
Or do you have intercourse, then date?

281
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,667
It's "The Song of Order."

282
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,800
Is there a message to the song?

283
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,734
I was just wondering whether people
had intercourse before they dated or not.

284
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,567
I wondered what people do.

285
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,700
I think both cases happen, don't they?

286
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:31,700
I put all that in a song.

287
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,266
Like which do you put on first?
Jeans or a shirt?

288
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,567
Just like that.

289
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,633
-Do you have a clothes version?
-I have a clothing song.

290
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,934
A clothing song?

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,667
-It's all about clothing.
-Jeans and shirts?

292
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,867
Do you put on jeans, then a shirt?
Or a shirt, then jeans?

293
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,567
Is it jeans, then a shirt?

294
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,200
Or a shirt, then jeans?

295
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:53,967
Is it jeans, then a shirt?

296
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,500
Do you put on a shirt, then put on jeans?

297
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,834
Is it jeans, then a shirt?

298
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,967
Or do you put on jeans
after you put on a shirt?

299
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,266
That was powerful.

300
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,600
I see.

301
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,834
So, what do you guys do?

302
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:08,667
Well...

303
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,433
We're comedians.

304
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,600
There was a time when
I wanted to be one, too.

305
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,567
-A comedian?
-You wanted to be one?

306
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,333
Did you go from comedy to singing?

307
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Or did you sing before trying comedy?

308
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,200
I wanted to do comedy,
then I became a singer

309
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,834
After I became a singer, I had intercourse

310
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,066
Intercourse?

311
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,667
You see, I love it.

312
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,033
-Intercourse?
-Yes.

313
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,667
Do you write the melody, then the lyrics?

314
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,767
Or do you write the lyrics,
then write the melody?

315
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,166
What happens after I write the lyrics?

316
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,734
Of course, I make the melody

317
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,266
What happens after I write the melody?

318
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,767
Of course, I record the song

319
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,266
What happens after I record the song?

320
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,567
You guessed it,

321
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,266
I have intercourse!

322
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,166
You sure like intercourse.

323
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,033
Go away.

324
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:03,800
Go.

325
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,266
Hey, somebody!

326
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Hey!

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,133
Somebody!

328
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,633
Hey, somebody!

329
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,900
"Hey, somebody"?

330
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:20,567
Would any of you happen to have
a charger cable for a PSP?

331
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,734
What do you want?

332
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:27,000
Would any of you happen to have
a charger cable for this PSP?

333
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,200
-No, we don't.
-Sorry.

334
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,033
Oh, my.

335
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,734
What game were you playing?

336
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,000
Me?

337
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:37,667
Well, I had the good fortune
of playing Tetris.

338
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,166
-Tetris?
-Yes.

339
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:43,333
Our musical theater troupe,
the Takarazuka Revue, are playing nearby.

340
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,133
In between shows,
I had been enjoying... a game.

341
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,533
You're with Takarazuka?

342
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,266
-So you're a woman?
-Yes, I am.

343
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,567
Allow me to introduce myself.

344
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,967
I am a member of the Takarazuka Revue.

345
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,600
My name is Kaoru Osuda.

346
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:57,800
Kaoru Osuda?

347
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,633
Please call me "Oskar" for short.

348
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,667
-You're a woman?
-Which troupe are you in?

349
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:07,633
The North Troupe.

350
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:08,900
The North Troupe?

351
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:12,033
Don't the troupes have names like
"Moon," "Flower" and "Star"?

352
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,967
We have North, South, East and West.

353
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,467
-We are...
-You are?

354
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,100
-However, Takaraz... kazu...
-"However"?

355
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,233
We're the Takara-revue-zuka.

356
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,500
Does nobody have a charger?

357
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,333
-Not on me, sorry.
-We don't have one.

358
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:27,900
Devastating.

359
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,300
How shall I spend my break?

360
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,300
Well, I guess I have no choice.

361
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,367
All I can do now is dance with joy.

362
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,467
Would you please join me?

363
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,066
But I don't know a thing about Takarazuka.

364
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,734
-Don't worry. Just follow my lead.
-Let her lead you.

365
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,233
-Have you ever danced before?
-No, never.

366
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, let my...

367
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,734
-Please stand.
-What?

368
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,333
-Please stand.
-"Let my" what?

369
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,667
Let me lead you.

370
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,233
I'm worried.

371
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,567
Light and hope...

372
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,734
and dreams

373
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:12,500
We each have our

374
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:15,000
Dreams

375
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:19,400
But when you're feeling down,
what does your heart tell you?

376
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,533
-I...
-They will become

377
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,767
Our precious memories

378
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,867
In times of sorrow and pain

379
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:42,967
We must always look ahead

380
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:49,734
And walk on

381
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:03,100
Thank you for helping me pass the time.

382
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,967
I truly am grateful.

383
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:11,200
If anybody happens to have
a charger cable for a PSP,

384
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,633
please bring it to our gig.

385
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,934
Your gig?

386
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,567
We're doing a national tour.

387
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,700
It's called "Weekend Takarazuka."

388
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,367
Like "Weekend Yoshimoto"?

389
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,834
You do that? We do "Weekend Takarazuka."

390
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,066
Yoshimoto has a weekend show
called "Weekend Yoshimoto."

391
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,000
We do a similar thing at Takarazuka.

392
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:32,300
If we play near you, please do come.

393
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,633
I must leave now.

394
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,934
He made a big move there.

395
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,333
He sure did.

396
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Akiyama, look at this.

397
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,367
Me?

398
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
-What is it?
-Tell me who it reminds you of.

399
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,867
-Should I turn it over?
-Yeah.

400
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:54,934
Who it reminds me of?

401
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,700
DRIVER'S LICENSE
ATSUSHI TSUTSUMISHITA

402
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,767
-He had a gold license.
-How is that possible?

403
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,367
He had a clean slate until then.

404
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,567
-He had a gold license?
-He had no driving offenses.

405
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
-You borrowed it from him?
-Yeah.

406
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,934
Do you know he changed
his social media icon?

407
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:27,033
-He did?
-Yeah.

408
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,800
-What is it now?
-Pipo-kun.

409
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,834
-The police mascot?
-Yeah.

410
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,934
-That's provocative of him.
-Wow.

411
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,333
Eikoh has never been
with Yoshimoto, right?

412
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,533
That's right.

413
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:40,700
Want to see what a Yoshimoto pay stub
looks like?

414
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,500
-Whose pay stub?
-Yoshimoto--

415
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,200
-It's a real pay stub.
-Is it?

416
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,400
It's real.

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,433
-Whose is it?
-I wonder.

418
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,800
-Is it okay to open?
-It's January's pay.

419
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:52,867
Whose is it?

420
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,300
It's not something you show people.

421
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,133
-This is scary.
-Hide the amount.

422
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,867
It's Tsutsumishita's!

423
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,333
What month is it for?

424
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,600
-January.
-January?

425
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,500
There are a lot of items.

426
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:07,934
Look at each amount.

427
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,533
"Minus 5,400 yen."

428
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,600
"Talent Expenses, November"?

429
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:16,800
What's that?

430
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:20,567
He earned 25 yen in royalties from
the DVD sales of Ametalk! Vol. 6.

431
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,467
How did he contribute so little?

432
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,400
-Since he's on leave now?
-Right.

433
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:27,633
-He only gets royalties from DVD sales?
-Exactly.

434
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,400
The Lincoln: Sports Day Special was...

435
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:31,600
"One yen."

436
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,867
One yen?!

437
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,967
-How do you even transfer that amount?
-It's too low to be taxed.

438
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,600
So what's the total amount?

439
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,633
Is that a "nine"?

440
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,100
"Nine thousand, five hundred
and thirteen yen."

441
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,533
Tsutsumishita hit the big time.

442
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:48,967
Really big time.

443
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,734
With zero hours of actual work.

444
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,800
How much did you earn
while on leave, Eikoh?

445
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,400
-Zero.
-Zero?

446
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,834
It was the same for me.
I was just getting DVD sales, and...

447
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,100
So,

448
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,633
shall we bring out a zombie?

449
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,633
-Zombies?
-Zombies.

450
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,266
Here they come.

451
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,533
It's time.

452
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,633
-We have to stay strong.
-Jimmy's coming, right? And Tamura.

453
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,100
-Jimmy and Tamura.
-This will be dangerous.

454
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,400
He looks exactly the same as when he left.

455
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,266
He had hours.

456
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
He hasn't changed one bit at all.

457
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:35,834
The World Cup.

458
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,033
Give me a minute.

459
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,300
Just a minute.

460
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,867
Singa-pole.

461
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,967
It's a pun about the center being a pole.

462
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:11,533
-"Shin-ga-pole" and "Singapore"?
-Singa-pole.

463
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,266
That hurts.

464
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,867
-Is he naked?
-He attached it directly.

465
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,900
That hurts!

466
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,200
That hurts.

467
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,467
-I said that hurts!
-You're neatly shaved.

468
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,667
Where did you find that?

469
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,100
Where did you find it?

470
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,333
An online shop.

471
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,066
For 1,980 yen.

472
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,300
1980.

473
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,700
Was it sold like that?

474
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,166
Was it sold like that?

475
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,667
You didn't alter it?

476
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:43,633
-You didn't alter it?
-I didn't. It came like this.

477
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,166
-Does it come off?
-Huh?

478
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,834
He never understands the first time.

479
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:52,300
If you lift it up by the chin,
it slips right out.

480
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,300
Singa-pole.

481
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,033
You tied it on?

482
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,066
-Is that okay?
-I tied it on.

483
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,600
Singa-pole.

484
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,734
Today, I...

485
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,867
I was...

486
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,333
Ouch.

487
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,100
I was on the train... Ouch!

488
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,300
-How is this attached?
-Stop touching me.

489
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:13,400
It hurts.

490
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,233
It hurts my private parts.

491
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,166
On my way here today...

492
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:18,467
Ow.

493
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,867
Can I take this off?

494
00:26:19,934 --> 00:26:20,934
No.

495
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,367
-It hurts.
-You can't.

496
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,400
But...

497
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,767
It... Ouch.

498
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,900
-It's killing the tip of my toes.
-Your toes?

499
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,367
I didn't mean my toes.

500
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,200
-The tip of your toes?
-Your toes?

501
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,967
-That's what he said.
-It's not my toes.

502
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,367
The tip of...

503
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,800
The tip of my...

504
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,166
-The tip bit.
-Tip bit?

505
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,367
The tip bit.

506
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:43,200
It hurts as if it's being pinched
by a zipper.

507
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,066
-That must hurt.
-It really does.

508
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,233
Is it erect?

509
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,867
It's not erect.

510
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,000
-It's pinched?
-It's pinched. That's why I'm in pain.

511
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
What can we do?

512
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,700
I have really tight foreskin.

513
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,533
That was a bold revelation.

514
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,967
We can't help you there.

515
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,734
That's not important now.

516
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:04,367
It's not?

517
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,133
It's not important now.

518
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,400
Anyway,

519
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,433
on my way here today,

520
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,800
I rode a bullet train.

521
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,533
And at Hamamatsu Station,

522
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:18,934
my hands got stuck in the door.

523
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:22,500
That's why there's blood under my nails.

524
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,166
-It wasn't just my hands.
-It wasn't?

525
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,033
My feet too.

526
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,033
-Your feet too?
-My feet too.

527
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,433
How were you stuck?

528
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,433
People can't get stuck like that.

529
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,133
I got stuck like this.

530
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,300
-That's impossible.
-I was like this.

531
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,600
Both feet.

532
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,700
I got stuck with both feet like this.

533
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:45,633
-That's why your nails are red?
-The pressure--

534
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,066
His testicles are so round.

535
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,066
-How round.
-Hey.

536
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,567
Watch out. I'm gonna fall!

537
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,567
I have blood under my nails.

538
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,233
His testicles are so round.

539
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,233
And you have terrible bunions.

540
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,233
You can laugh, Jimmy.

541
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,200
You're allowed now.

542
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,567
I am?

543
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,734
-You're already a zombie.
-Zombies can laugh?

544
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,867
Sorry about that.

545
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Want to play Russian roulette?

546
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,934
-That's scary.
-We have no idea what's in that.

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,467
Should I go first?

548
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,166
I'll go first.

549
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,200
You guys pass it around. Russian roulette.

550
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,133
-That's too scary.
-What will happen?

551
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:27,467
It's the kind of thing that kills people.

552
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:28,967
I don't want to die.

553
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,133
It just goes bang?

554
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,967
-How many bullets are there?
-Huh?

555
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:34,867
-Why don't you ever get it the first time?
-12 bullets.

556
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:37,066
-It doesn't hold that many.
-It couldn't.

557
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,800
-Isn't it six?
-Six bullets.

558
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,934
One out of six.

559
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,700
-Is a real bullet?
-Yeah.

560
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,333
Does it go bang?

561
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,233
-Does it go bang?
-What other noise would it make?

562
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,600
-He's mad at you.
-Does it fire anything?

563
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,734
I'm sorry. Does it fire something?

564
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,734
Stop making them repeat themselves.

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,400
Will it go bang?

566
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,600
It will go bang.

567
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,767
Do you need that cap?

568
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,467
It doesn't do anything.
It's for fire safety.

569
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,633
You go first, Jimmy.

570
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,467
Okay. I'll go first.

571
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,433
Here I go.

572
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,033
I lost.

573
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Get those bunions taken care of.

574
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:20,567
You can laugh, Jimmy.

575
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,834
That was close.

576
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,100
-That Singa-pole was dangerous.
-It sure was.

577
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,200
Jimmy's face is so funny
when he tries not to laugh.

578
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:38,567
The fact he hadn't changed was funny, too.

579
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,734
What are you doing, Zakoshi?

580
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm gonna take a bath.

581
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,233
-What?
-A bath.

582
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,834
-Check the water temperature.
-You're all bathing?

583
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,734
-You're taking a bath?
-I am.

584
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,834
-We want to freshen up.
-Yeah.

585
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,266
-This is too hot.
-Where is the bath?

586
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,000
Now it's perfect.

587
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,400
-Will you fit?
-Yeah.

588
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,166
-You won't fit.
-I need a bath.

589
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:11,633
-Can it take his weight?
-It will break.

590
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,467
-Won't it break?
-It's okay.

591
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,900
-You won't fit.
-I can fit in this bath.

592
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,600
-It's totally the wrong size.
-Is the table okay?

593
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,433
-Think it will break?
-Definitely.

594
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,934
Do it on the floor.

595
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,400
What are you doing?

596
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,033
Akiyama's taking a bath too.

597
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,667
He's totally having a bath.

598
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,533
They both chose to have a bath?

599
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,467
Okay.

600
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:00,500
How is it?

601
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,467
It's just the right temperature.

602
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,166
Is that so?

603
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,834
Each has his own style.

604
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:09,567
-Actually, it's a little hot.
-It's too hot?

605
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,800
How about Akiyama?

606
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,867
-He's washing his whole body.
-Let him dip too.

607
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,333
-May I?
-Sure.

608
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,600
-It's a little hot.
-It is, right?

609
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:22,433
I thought so too.

610
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,734
-It's a little cold out here. May I?
-Sure.

611
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,433
It's a nice bath, isn't it?

612
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,867
It's quite warm!

613
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,233
-A little hot, actually.
-Right?

614
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
-Is that how you take a bath?
-Yeah.

615
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,166
You have a unique method.

616
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,800
I want to dip it all the way.

617
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,266
I like dipping it to the very base.

618
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,834
-You'll catch a cold.
-That's why I go deep.

619
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,500
Didn't Gauguin do a painting like that?

620
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:58,533
He has his own approach.

621
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,133
He sheathed the whole lot.

622
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,500
That's how you put the whole lot in?

623
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,600
Did he wash off the suds?

624
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,000
-Then you switch to the cold water?
-Yes.

625
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,100
This feels so good.

626
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,266
Thank you.

627
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,867
Shall we release Zombie Tamura?

628
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:26,333
Okay, let's go.

629
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,100
That always scares me.

630
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,467
Really? It looked like fun?

631
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,400
It looked like great fun.

632
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,734
-Really?
-Yeah.

633
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,900
-I was pretty confident about that.
-I can see why.

634
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,033
-It's hugely popular in Osaka now.
-I was wondering why.

635
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,567
The Fartmonica.

636
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,533
Everyone, Jimmy wants to try it.

637
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,500
-Could you line up on that side?
-Again?

638
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,066
And if you hear anything,

639
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,600
tell us.

640
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,633
If we hear what?

641
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,166
A sound from the harmonica.

642
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:06,166
With the Fartmonica,
you lose if you make a sound.

643
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,433
-Jimmy's going to play it?
-Right.

644
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,433
He's still wearing that thing.

645
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,467
-What?
-His Singa-pole.

646
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,800
He's still wearing it.

647
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,467
-Are you?
-No.

648
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,734
-Yes, he is.
-We can see it.

649
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,633
-Why is he laughing?
-What's so funny?

650
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,767
-Use your hands, Jimmy.
-Here we go.

651
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,233
If you make a sound, you lose.

652
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,467
Ready?

653
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:33,367
Here I go.

654
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,300
Where did it go?

655
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,033
-He broke it.
-It broke off!

656
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,533
My Singa-pole...

657
00:33:57,834 --> 00:33:59,700
-What happened?
-It's coming out!

658
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,500
His Singa-pole is peeking out.

659
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,533
That was unexpected!

660
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,066
F.

661
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:18,667
F?

662
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,066
He has absolute pitch.

663
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,266
Was that an F?

664
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:25,900
F.

665
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,066
F?

666
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,233
That one sounded different
from the first one.

667
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:36,734
F.

668
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,300
-Play a C, please.
-C?

669
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:44,367
C, please.

670
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:47,667
What was that?

671
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,700
-C.
-Say, "F"!

672
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,233
You need to say, "F."

673
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,934
Play anything but a C,
and say "F," no matter what.

674
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,967
We're leaving.

675
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,233
I've been alone with him for too long.

676
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:04,934
Ouch.

677
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,967
That was close!

678
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,533
So close!

679
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,734
That was a dirty move!

680
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,734
That was close! I couldn't take any more.

681
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,166
That was like revisiting
the very origins of comedy.

682
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,633
-We stuck at it.
-You sure did.

683
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,934
I think two of you laughed.

684
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,367
Who?

685
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,600
I think it was Takahashi and Jinnai.

686
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
I think Takahashi laughed,

687
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,000
but I held it in.

688
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:42,066
Let's see.

689
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,333
I've been alone with him for too long.

690
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,834
Ouch.

691
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:52,300
That was only as much of a smile
as Junior made before!

692
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,800
-There's no difference!
-You sprayed a laugh.

693
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
He did.

694
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,500
You're both out!

695
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,767
All right!

696
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,000
-They're both out? This is big.
-It is big.

697
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,033
You're all on thin ice.

698
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,633
All except Zakoshi.

699
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,000
-Zakoshi.
-He has zero cards.

700
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,500
At this rate, he'll win.

701
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:17,734
I have zero cards.

702
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,633
But Zakoshi is making a lot of moves.
He's really going for it.

703
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,000
-So nobody can complain.
-Right?

704
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,667
If I was playing it safe,
they could complain.

705
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,333
So for now,

706
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,266
-we're going.
-Good job.

707
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,533
How can I put it?

708
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,367
It was bizarre in there. It really was.

709
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,867
What did you do after having a drink?

710
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,467
You guessed it, we had intercourse

711
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:46,433
Do you date before having intercourse?
Or do you have intercourse, then date?

712
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:51,400
It was even more bizarre in that room
than I could have imagined.

713
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,567
Well, what can I say?

714
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,600
It's frustrating.

715
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,266
It's like...

716
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,600
Yeah.

717
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,800
Jimmy was just too much.

718
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:05,967
Ouch.

719
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:11,133
You can't help but laugh.
Sooner or later, he gets you.

720
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,333
Well...

721
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,233
That was fierce.

722
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:20,266
So, how is this going to turn out?

723
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,233
Here we go.

724
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:30,133
Zakoshi, can you go over to that sofa
and do something for me?

725
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,100
Nobody's ever laughed at this.

726
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,300
Your impression of Masanobu Kurisu.

727
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,500
All right.

728
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,800
-Who?
-Masanobu Kurisu.

729
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,266
-But Junior doesn't know him.
-So what? Nobody laughs anyway.

730
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,700
-What's the name? Masa...
-Masanobu.

731
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:46,467
-Who is he?
-A pro-wrestler.

732
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:47,700
A bald one.

733
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,166
Not even pro-wrestling fans laugh at it.

734
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,734
Go do it in the corner.

735
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,467
What the hell were you doin'?

736
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:02,033
Why didn't you jump in
and stop the referee?

737
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,433
What were you doin'?

738
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,934
Get that camera outta here!

739
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:11,133
I told you to get out!

740
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,266
Get outta here!

741
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:15,400
What the hell are you doin'?

742
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,066
What's this?

743
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,266
What's this?

744
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,233
What's this?

745
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,300
-What?
-What?

746
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
What the hell are you doin'?

747
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:29,734
What the hell are you doin'?

748
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,066
It's a tag match!

749
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,567
It's a tag match!

750
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,667
Why didn't you jump in and stop him?

751
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,700
Why didn't you jump in and stop him?

752
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:40,767
Get outta here!

753
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:42,000
Get outta here!

754
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,533
I said go!

755
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:45,133
I said go!

756
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,800
-What are you doin'?
-What are you doin'?

757
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,133
That was a tag match!

758
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,100
That was a tag match!

759
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,100
That's a funny sight.

760
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:17,500
-That was amazing!
-Yeah, that really hit the spot.

761
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:19,934
What is this toy?

762
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,867
That was too much.

763
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:23,500
Magnificent.

764
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:26,133
That was magnificent.

765
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:29,333
-That monkey is amazing.
-Whose point was it?

766
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,567
Kano, for bringing it.

767
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,700
Or Junior, for handing him the harmonica.

768
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,800
The point belongs to one of them.

769
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,533
Akiyama, you're out!

770
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:53,567
You fought a good fight, but...

771
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,567
Just over one hour to go.

772
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:03,533
We're down to the last hour.

773
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Zakoshi is so tough.
He was closest to the monkey.

774
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:10,367
I saw it coming,
but I just couldn't dodge it.

775
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:12,667
I'd never laugh at a normal harmonica,

776
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:15,967
but that monkey came back
with exactly the same melody.

777
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,767
I laughed with a clear conscience.

778
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,667
My bag is still full of things
that I wanted to do today.

779
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,867
But I still have enough time
to create fun as a zombie.

780
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:31,467
So I'll switch modes and do my best.

781
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,166
Here we go.

782
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,600
Now then, Zakoshi.

783
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,934
Do that bit which bombs at every theater.

784
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Your impression of Hiromichi Fuyuki.

785
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:47,600
Fuyuki gets laughs!

786
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,333
Hiromichi Fuyuki?

787
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,667
-When he's with Chono.
-Okay. Well...

788
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,900
Imagine Chono is standing here.

789
00:40:56,033 --> 00:41:00,166
But Hiromichi Fuyuki is a wrestler
who doesn't speak very clearly.

790
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:02,133
He says to Chono,

791
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,467
"If we teamed up,
we'd be invincible. Right?"

792
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,367
But he's so unclear,
this is how it sounds.

793
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
Right?

794
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Right?

795
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,266
When will he start the impression?

796
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:24,767
He's already doing it.

797
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,633
-I'm doing it.
-That was it?

798
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,033
I'm still doing it.

799
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,567
OK, here we go.

800
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:34,734
It scared me again.

801
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,033
Zombies, eh?

802
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,066
That was close.

803
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:44,033
He came straight back as a zombie.

804
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,834
Well, you know.

805
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,567
I guess it's age.

806
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,567
I'm getting way too flabby.

807
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,467
So I've started doing
"formation gymnastics."

808
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:56,200
Since it can't be done alone,

809
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,767
I've started doing it
with members of the public.

810
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:02,834
And going to the gym is a bit, you know...

811
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,934
Do you mind if I bring someone here?

812
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,567
Please come in!

813
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,667
-Hello. It's nice to meet you.
-Hello.

814
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:15,533
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for inviting me.

815
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,533
Do you know who I am?

816
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:20,233
Yes, I'm a big fan of yours.
Of course I do.

817
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,767
I selected you from
a number of applicants.

818
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:24,500
-Thank you.
-The pleasure's mine.

819
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:27,100
Did you hear we'll be doing
gymnastic formations?

820
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,600
That's all I've heard.

821
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,967
-We'll be exercising.
-I see.

822
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:32,400
This way, please.

823
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:33,934
Thank you.

824
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:37,967
We'll be choosing formations
at random from this box.

825
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,433
How should we do this?

826
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:43,033
-Thanks for coming.
-Not at all.

827
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,000
Right?

828
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,900
Okay, let's go with this one.

829
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,266
"The Kaminarimon in Asakusa"!

830
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,633
Okay, let's go with this one.

831
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,100
"The Kaminarimon in Asakusa"!

832
00:42:57,734 --> 00:42:59,900
The famous gate outside that temple.

833
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,400
How shall we do it?

834
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:04,233
What shall we do?

835
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,033
We have to make a formation.

836
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:07,500
Okay.

837
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,033
Could you widen your stance a bit?

838
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,400
Please spread your legs more.

839
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,000
You'll be the gate.

840
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:16,266
I'll be a tourist at the gate.

841
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:19,266
Okay. Please spread them a little wider.

842
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,567
Perhaps this will do.

843
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,700
Oh, my. Is this Kaminarimon?

844
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,233
Oh, my.

845
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,533
Okay.

846
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,467
Today's my lucky day.
I'm going through the gate.

847
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:38,266
You're a very small Kaminarimon!

848
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,333
Yes!

849
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:42,333
-A narrow Kaminarimon!
-I'm teeny.

850
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,433
What?

851
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
I'm teeny!

852
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,600
This is a little different from
the Kaminarimon I know.

853
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm teeny!

854
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,333
-But what a great view!
-Thanks!

855
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,834
What a fantastic view!

856
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,834
Great.

857
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:00,567
I think that went well, didn't it?

858
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:01,900
What's next?

859
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,600
Let's see.

860
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,967
I can't believe they aren't laughing.

861
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:09,633
"A piano performance"? What shall we do?

862
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:12,300
Since you're a lady,
you can be the pianist.

863
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,900
Okay, I'm the piano. Start.

864
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,700
Please play me!

865
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:18,300
More!

866
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,433
That's it! Plink, plank, plunk.

867
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,967
Classical music!

868
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:29,900
Play a bit more down there. A higher note.

869
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,133
That higher note.

870
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:34,000
Isn't the key a bit lower?

871
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
The key.

872
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,533
No...

873
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,367
Where is the key?

874
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:44,166
Play the key. Where's the key?

875
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,767
-Where's the human key?
-There's no key here.

876
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:49,433
Something's not right.
Are you ignoring one key?

877
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,533
-I am!
-I thought so!

878
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,867
You're ignoring one spot, right?

879
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,600
She's definitely ignoring one spot.

880
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,600
Okay, let's try another.

881
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,333
This one?

882
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,633
"Driving a bulldozer"!

883
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:10,100
How do we drive a bulldozer?

884
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,300
What shall we do?

885
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,567
Can you drive?

886
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:13,800
No, I can't.

887
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:15,900
Well then, let's do this.

888
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:17,533
It moves like this.

889
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,600
-Like this?
-Hop on here.

890
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,233
-Like this?
-Sit down or it'll never work.

891
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,166
Sit here.

892
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:25,400
I have to sit there? Why?

893
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,033
-You have to--
-That's too embarrassing.

894
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,767
-Come on. Sit here.
-That's too embarrassing.

895
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,000
-You can't drive standing up.
-No.

896
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:36,667
-I chose you out of all the applicants.
-Okay.

897
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,500
-Not just anyone will do.
-Okay!

898
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,700
No, it isn't!

899
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:40,734
Sit here.

900
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,166
-It's embarrassing!
-Sit right here.

901
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:45,734
-Sit here. Like that.
-Okay.

902
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,967
Further up.

903
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,800
Sit further up.

904
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,233
You have to sit here, or there's no point.

905
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,734
-This is the seat.
-The seat? Okay.

906
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:55,200
Drive me.

907
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:03,967
-You have to come further up!
-But it's embarrassing!

908
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,734
-Why?
-It just is!

909
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,233
What's with that?

910
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:09,633
Man.

911
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,767
What's this?

912
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:13,300
It says "69."

913
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,667
Sixty-nine?

914
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:18,500
That's my age.

915
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,200
Your age?

916
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:31,934
That was close!

917
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,000
So close!

918
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,600
He got me again.

919
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:39,967
Again...

920
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,700
She had just the right level of shyness.

921
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,200
Thank you.

922
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,834
I think the fact she wasn't
completely into it was wonderful.

923
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:55,467
Yamauchi came very close.

924
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,266
But he scraped through.

925
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,266
Kobayashi!

926
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,700
You totally laughed, right?

927
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:03,667
-I did.
-You totally laughed.

928
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:05,000
Let's take a look.

929
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:08,500
What's this?

930
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:09,867
It says "69."

931
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,400
Sixty-nine?

932
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,266
That's my age.

933
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,934
Your age?

934
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:20,667
That's hard to describe.

935
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:24,033
It was a happy moment.
I laughed out of happiness.

936
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,667
-It was heartwarming.
-Yes.

937
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:27,834
So...

938
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,900
You're out.

939
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:39,033
Part of me wanted to see you do a 69.

940
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:43,600
You are the last four.

941
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:47,967
Well, you know,

942
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,633
this may sound like an excuse,

943
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,300
but personally, I think the casting
for this season was terrible.

944
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:57,834
How so?

945
00:47:57,934 --> 00:48:01,533
I went in ready for war,
but the room was full of my friends.

946
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:12,800
The moment I saw the other members,
I thought, "What am I going to do?"

947
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:17,600
But in the end, I was simply wrapped up
in a blanket of warm laughter.

948
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:20,734
I laughed twice,
but the same thing happened both times.

949
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,233
The moment I felt my heart warming up,
a laugh slipped out.

950
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,867
You put that much on?

951
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:26,934
What is this?

952
00:48:27,066 --> 00:48:28,633
What a well-behaved penis.

953
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,900
It's a clever penis.

954
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,800
I went in wanting to tear the place down,

955
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:39,867
but I just had a nice and enjoyable time.

956
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,133
Here we go.

957
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,533
That scares me.

958
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,266
May I take these out?

959
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:55,900
May I?

960
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,233
-You still have them?
-They look painful.

961
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,834
-They look scary.
-Really?

962
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:04,233
Could you do it?

963
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,233
No way!

964
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,967
You can't touch other people's eyes!

965
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:10,900
But...

966
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,066
To be honest, today is the first time
I've ever worn contact lenses.

967
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:19,734
-But you can't touch people's contacts.
-Really? Is it illegal?

968
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,433
I wouldn't say it's illegal.

969
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,100
Legally, there's no problem.

970
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,433
-It's about hygiene.
-It's unhygienic?

971
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,734
Fingers are dirty.

972
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:32,567
You won't?

973
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,567
With a tissue?!

974
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,266
But when I was rubbing them before--

975
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,800
You can't do that.
Pinch them with your fingers like this.

976
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,900
You're nearly there.

977
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:47,667
Nearly there.

978
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,433
I have to touch my eye?

979
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,133
Hey! Wait a minute!

980
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,867
Hold on!

981
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,433
What am I doing
laughing at somebody's balls?

982
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:53,433
-He laughed.
-Are you out?

983
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,667
Do you have one more chance?

984
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:56,767
That was nasty.

985
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,166
-They ganged up on me!
-They sure did.

986
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,900
But rules are rules.

987
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:05,667
You totally cracked up laughing.

988
00:51:05,734 --> 00:51:06,867
Let's take a look.

989
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:09,767
I have to touch my eye?

990
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,700
Hey! Wait a minute!

991
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,166
-You laughed hard!
-Sorry.

992
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:26,333
You're out!

993
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:28,934
After making it this far.

994
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,734
-Zakoshi is too tough.
-He sure is.

995
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,100
No, I wouldn't say that.

996
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,667
He doesn't even seem to be
holding it back.

997
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,467
I'm so frustrated.

998
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,767
I'm sure you are.

999
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:46,367
I wish you all well.

1000
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:49,667
There were only 40 minutes left.
Just 40 minutes.

1001
00:51:50,266 --> 00:51:52,300
I'd earned some points too.

1002
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,166
It's so frustrating!

1003
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:58,500
I've watched all four seasons so far,

1004
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,900
but it's totally different
when you're actually there.

1005
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:03,633
Everyone is so talented,

1006
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,200
I started feeling embarrassed about
doing the bits I'd prepared.

1007
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:09,667
It takes guts to perform in front of them.

1008
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:11,066
Even when you're prepared.

1009
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:15,233
Would any of you happen to have
a charger cable for this PSP?

1010
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,400
-No, we don't.
-Sorry.

1011
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:19,133
Oh, my.

1012
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:23,000
But I'm amazed I held out until
there were only 40 minutes left.

1013
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:26,233
I'd like to pat myself on the back
for that.

1014
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:29,033
Yeah.

1015
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,567
Here we go.

1016
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,367
Do you mind if I call my Helper now?

1017
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:44,633
-You have that left too?
-Yeah.

1018
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,266
-Of course.
-Okay?

1019
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:47,367
Come in!

1020
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:49,567
Here comes Zakoshi's Helper.

1021
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,266
He's my junior.

1022
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,133
-He's with the same agency?
-Yeah, Sony.

1023
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,433
It's Jiro, from the duo Charming.

1024
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,467
He's here?

1025
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,800
Come in!

1026
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,600
-Hello.
-Hi.

1027
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,767
-Jiro, do your thing.
-What thing?

1028
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,333
Your onnagata.

1029
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:15,166
Like in kabuki,
when a male actor plays a woman?

1030
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,834
But that takes time to prepare.

1031
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,133
Don't tell me you need time to prepare
at this stage!

1032
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:23,066
Sorry, but it really takes time
to prepare for that.

1033
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,800
There's no time to prepare!

1034
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,567
Okay, there's space back there.
Go get ready.

1035
00:53:27,633 --> 00:53:29,900
-A kabuki actor playing a woman?
-Yeah.

1036
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,967
-My onnagata?
-Do your onnagata.

1037
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,433
And hurry up. Don't take too long.

1038
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:37,133
A male kabuki actor playing a woman.

1039
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,533
-Onnagata?
-Onnagata.

1040
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:45,700
I'm a woman!

1041
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,367
I'm a man!

1042
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:49,166
I'm a woman!

1043
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:50,800
I'm a man!

1044
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:01,533
Way to go, Jiro!

1045
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,433
Well, he did laugh.

1046
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:05,667
More than anything, I was surprised.

1047
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,500
How fast did he undress?

1048
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,066
-That was all about speed.
-He's super fast.

1049
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:12,667
That speed... Nice to meet you.

1050
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:14,166
Nice to meet you.

1051
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:17,800
I've never seen you clothed,
but nice to meet you.

1052
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,367
That speed was lethal, right?

1053
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:22,700
Well, I was surprised.

1054
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,767
He's fast.

1055
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:25,934
That's what it was about.

1056
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,133
-Let's take a look.
-Give me a break.

1057
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:30,967
Do your onnagata.

1058
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,000
-My onnagata?
-Do your onnagata.

1059
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:36,200
-Hurry up. Don't take long.
-It was such a basic setup.

1060
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:38,367
A male kabuki actor playing a woman.

1061
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:42,200
After waiting to come out for so long,
he went backstage again...

1062
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,367
I'm a woman!

1063
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,333
I'm a man!

1064
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,033
What's done is done.

1065
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:57,900
-I'm going one-on-one with Zakoshi?
-Thanks.

1066
00:54:57,967 --> 00:55:00,700
-It's just the two of us? Me and Junior?
-Right.

1067
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,066
Really? All right!

1068
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,100
Yamauchi put up a great fight, but...

1069
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,433
After coming this far, I wanted to win.

1070
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,066
But the moment he appeared,

1071
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:16,467
I thought,
"He doesn't look like a comedian at all."

1072
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:18,467
That was funny for one thing.

1073
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:22,400
I thought he looked like a writer,
or maybe a researcher.

1074
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:25,300
Onnagata? But that takes time to prepare.

1075
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:29,367
After leaving the room he got butt naked
with such incredible speed.

1076
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:33,266
Then he came out,
and it had nothing to do with kabuki.

1077
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm a woman!

1078
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:36,867
I'm a man!

1079
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,133
I wanted to hold out a little longer.

1080
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:43,100
I hate to admit it,

1081
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,734
but Zakoshisyoh is such a strong opponent.

1082
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,200
I can't believe they're not laughing!

1083
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:59,834
NEXT EPISODE

1084
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:06,734
Here come the zombies.

1085
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,533
Give me your underwear!

1086
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:17,266
The best feel-good massage.

1087
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,400
Me too, please.

1088
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:26,667
It was exhausting even just to watch.

1089
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:29,567
I'm worried about
how sore I'll be tomorrow.

1090
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:30,633
Really worried.
