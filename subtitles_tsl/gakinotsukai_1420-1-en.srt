00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,520
The 1st Gaki no Tsukai Arahende chikichiki

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,320
Dance until you spread on social media~!!

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,240
Well...

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,660
is everyone aware of the temperature outside?

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,140
It's a nice day today.
- Yes, it's easily over 95°F. The heat is really intense!

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,540
Regarding today's plan...

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,300
let's go around drinking delicious iced-coffee around town.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,900
That's drastically different from what was said.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,400
"Dance until you spread on social media."
- Oh is that so?

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,140
I didn't get a chance to communicate with the staff.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
Get that part right.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,440
Things spread on social media so fast. So-and-so did this. So-and-so did that.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,960
And we won't be playing against each other, but...

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,040
right now, one-by-one, we'll dance somewhere in public.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,720
And you can't stop until you get on social media.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,660
Rule 1: With no visible film crew, dance by yourself in the park.

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,200
Rule 2: Until someone tweets about it, you can't stop.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,700
But today is a heat wave above 104°F!

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,520
Ueno Park as the stage, the curtains open up to a harsh environment.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,580
These are the dances.

21
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:29,765
There's lots.

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,580
Tako Dance...they have to mention the dance too.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,260
"Endo is doing the Para Para."

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,855
So it has to have those two words.

25
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:42,485
It's about 2:30, right now.

26
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:45,340
The temperature is going up and up.

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,600
Let's finish this quck.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,940
What should we do about the order?

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,380
One-by-one, right?

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,380
Let the young guys go first.

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,660
We're not that young though.

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,740
We're 47.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,980
This is Japan now.

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,300
With that, the young, Tanaka attempts.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,980
His dance is?

36
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,380
When you think Tanaka, you think "Loach Scoop".

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,420
So Loach Scoop? I understand.

38
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,260
Better not pretend to faint.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,760
If you're gonna fall, fall forward. Backwards is fainting.

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,420
(Ueno Park in front of the water fountain)
- Where is he at?

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,720
Ahh! He's walking. Left. Left.

42
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,620
No one's following with cameras so...

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,860
it looks like Tanaka's private time.

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,060
Tanaka does a solid job.

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,140
Chopsticks.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,120
Do that and carry that.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go!!

48
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,960
The chopsticks...

49
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,900
might make it harder to recognize that it's Tanaka.

50
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,880
Maybe he shouldn't have used them.

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,520
This is bad. They think he's weird so nobody wants to get closer.

52
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,140
They're watching and laughing from afar.

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,180
I mean, if that was there, would you go?

54
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,680
Some sightseers...

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,620
are doing something.

56

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,440
A lot of tourists!
- This is bad!

58
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
Your movements are too slow.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,960
You don't look like your scooping loaches.

60
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,540
Cleaner.

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,120
Do it for real!

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,180
Yea, yea, yea...

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,080
You'll pass out in 10 minutes.

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,460
You're not showing up at all.

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Not showing up at all?

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,120
Please, hurry up.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,820
How many loaches did you catch?

68
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,300
Right now, I caught 3.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,540
Caught 3, did ya?

70
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,980
That's a lot!

71
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,620
It's been 10 minutes.
- It has been 10 minutes.

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,300
This is a disaster.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,100
Nothing's showing up.

74
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:17,615
Is that so?

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,020
What do you wanna do?
- It's cus no one's watching.

76
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,800
There isn't even a tweet regarding Tanaka, is there?

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,320
Oh he's doing something.

78
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,600
Is he waving?

79
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,995
They just came to look.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,060
But maybe he...

81
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,260
inputted to them that Tanaka is loach scooping so.

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,760
But they just nodded and left.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
I wonder what they're thinking.

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,240
This is tough.

85
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,880
Wanna bring him back?
- Bring him back.

86
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,620
Tanaka, wanna come back one time?

87
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
This is impossible.

88
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll come back.
[Challenge Time 15:16]

89
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,780

No, nothing.

- Not even "Cocorico Tanaka".

Nice job.

How was it?

95
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:14,675
Um...

It doesn't matter how long.

97

You're sweating.

98

We were all saying...

99
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,020
another hour and it'll be good.

100

No way!

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,880
No way. I'll pass out before then.

102
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,820
Let's try someone else.

103
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,640
Please, please. Someone else go.

Who? Who's goin?
- Emperor!

106
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,160
Ahh! Dahama-san, right?

107
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,960
If it doesn't work here for Dahama-san, then it's impossible.

108
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right! If it's impossible for Downtown then it's impossible.

109
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,460
Next challenger is Hamada

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,980
His selected dance is?

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,700
I can do the Twist.

112
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:01,725
Ehhh?

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,400
This feels super exhausting.

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,260
The familiar the dance, the better.

115
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
They'll know what the Twist is.

116
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,880
Please, Hamada-san!

117
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880

118

while on standby, a guy recognized him...

119
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,120
and took out his cellphone.

120
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,560

He does the Twist fast.

124
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,740
Was the Twist that fast?

125
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,195
Even the Twist experts don't go that fast.

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,760
They're coming!

127
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,400
Wow, you're right! Incredible!

128
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,420
Agh! Did he pull his back?

129
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,480
What's wrong?
- He probably pulled his back.

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580

131
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,580
It's flashy.

183
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,500
Next, Endo attempts with the Samba!

184
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
Will he get tweeted!?

185
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,900
(Ueno Park in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum 93.9°F)

186
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,120
He's a man who knows the Samba.

187
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,820
I think Endo will do it.

188
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,600
There he goes.

189
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,700
Nice, nice. It's the Samba.

190
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,720
Can he keep this up?

191
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,480
Is this the rhythm of the Samba?

192
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,615
It's working.

193
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,880
What happened?

194
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:57,685
What's wrong?

195
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,425
How bout her?

196
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,685
Is that her cellphone? Did she take a picture?

197
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,880
Endo, what's wrong?

198
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
It's hot!

199
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,900
It's hot!

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,300
It's not that hot!

201
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
It's super hot.

202
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,920
You're fine.

203
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,860
There's no sense of the Samba.

204
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,700
Really?

205
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
It feels like Samba here.

206
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
Smile more.

207
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,280
Like you're having fun time.

208
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll show more fun.

209
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,120
Nice! Nice!

210
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
What's this rhythm?

211
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,140
I've never heard of this rhythm.

212
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:53,205
Endo reaches the limit of his all-out Samba.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And then!

214
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,120
[Cocorico's Endo is at Ueno Park with feathers and dancing the Samba.]

215
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
YES~!

216
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,820
Thank you very much!

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,420
Man, I'm tired.

218
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,220
I wonder who it was.
- I have no idea.

219
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,800
Probably a college girl.

220
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,180
Amazing, Endo.

221
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,380
Except...

222
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,920
...what is that?

223
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
That's not Samba, is it?

224
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,940
Wasn't that in a commercial?

225
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:42,285
It's the Ippon Manzoku.

226
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,795
Maybe that came out.

227
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,520
So who's next?
- Ain't that you?

228
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,560
Shall we?

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,980
Of course it is.

230
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:56,815
That's fine. I'll do it. But there aren't any more dances.

231
00:12:56,935 --> 00:13:00,085
Do Wotagei.
- Wotagei?

232
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,925
I've never done that.

233
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,025
I've never done it.

234
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,380
No "dying" out there.

235
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,560
None of that.

236
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,380
He just falls back.

237
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,380
No "dying" and running away?

238
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,220
If you please!

239
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Wotagei.

240
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,460
(Ueno Park National Science Museum 93.6°F)

241
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,520
Here he comes.

242
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,160
There's people in front.

243
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,700
He's already getting attention.

244
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,000
They gave him something.

245
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,780
Pen lights.

246
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,560
Oh fast.
- What's he doing?

247
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:53,095
What's he doin?
- That ain't Wotagei.

248
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,095
What's he doin!?

249
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,640
This ain't Wotagei.

250
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,300
He's not doing it at all.

251
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,080
People notice him, right?

252
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,140
Everyone's looking at the weirdo.

253
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,600
Makes sense.

254
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,180
They're scared.

255
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,300
Maybe the uncomfortable people will tweet something.

256
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,680
You're sluggish.

257
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,940
What is that? What are you doin?

258
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Wotagei.

259
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,465
I don't know Wotagei.

260
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,200
Is it faster?
- Faster.

261
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,140
Faster?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,800
Faster?

263
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,160
The speed's gone up.
- Nice, nice. It's cleaner.

264
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,080
No tweets?

265
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,900
But people are watching.

266
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,320
The people around you are watching.

267
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,840
This is tough. This is tough.

268
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,780
This is tough.

269
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,835
Maybe they're foreigners.
- Maybe.

270
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,580
That whole family's staring.

271
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,340
Right in front of the stage.
- Those are good seats.

272
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,800
You don't get to see Matsumoto like this.
- That's true.

273
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,400
Everyone's playing with their smartphones.

274
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,260
Are they filming him?

275
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,540
Is he playing the music?

276
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,955
Yea, try it with the music.

277
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:23,935
Here we go.

278
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,400
They're looking.

279
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,340
The family is taking pictures.

280
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,920
What kind of movement is this?

281
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,920
People are gathering.

282
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,900
Until now, this is the most people.

283
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,360
Now, if they'll just tweet it.

284
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,185
He's shutting down.

285
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,740
They're taking pictures.

286
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Matchan, do your best~!

287
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,320
"Do your best", the kids are saying, Matsumoto-san.

288
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,880
It got faster.

289
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Matchan, do your best~!

290
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,500
What's goin on here?

291
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,620
If this many people are watching and taking pictures, you should get a tweet soon.

292
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,780
Do your best, Matchan~!

293
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,540
Wanna come back, one time?

294
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,060
Comin back.
[Challenge Time 11:05]

295
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,860
This should get some.

296
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,260
They might come later.

297
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,215
Look, he's tapping away.

298
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:04,405
He is tapping away.

299
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,660
They're not posting cus you were still there.

300
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:18,805
And the kids were cheering you on.

301
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:24,165
I've never wasted so much energy in my life.

302
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,660
There's a high possibility. A lot of people were typing.

303
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,300
No way. I should get something.

304
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,460
Anything?

305
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,060
Something came.

306
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,380
[I got a picture of Matchan falling over.]

307
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,220
Except there's no "Wotagei".
- That's true.

308
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,260
What the hell is Wotagei?

309
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,440
I don't know it.
- That's not our fault! That's what it is.

310
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,080
There were so many people! There were so many smartphones...

311
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,300
Something?

312
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,820
[Matsumoto Hitoshi-san was doing Wotagei at Ueno.]

313
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,820
That's complete! That's complete!

314
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,640
Wow, wow, wow...

315
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,100
There's even a picture!
- That's perfect!

316
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,920
Complete! Complete!

317
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
That's perfect.
- You even have a picture!

318
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,020
You did better than Endo.

319
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,560
It feels good when you get it.
- It does feel good when you get it!

320
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
Next, Housei attempts.

321
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,780
He picks the Tako Dance.

322
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,040
Here?

323
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,240
We're changing spots.

324
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,440
If you can, go deep.

325
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,340
Like an alley or something.

326
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,740
Not an alley.

327
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,660
Someplace with a lot of people.

328
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,000
You can wander around the alleys.

329
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,020
Like an octopus.

330
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,220
Find a narrow alleyway and just...

331
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,840
Moving to a popular evening, sightseeing spot, to Odaiba we go.

332
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,540
Can Housei get tweeted doing the Tako Dance?

333
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,700
(Decks Tokyo Beach Center Deck 90.5°F)
- There he is!

334
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,320
Quietly enters the scene.

335
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,700
No movement as of now.

336
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,960
Counting on you.

337
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,540
They see him.

338
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
Nothing at all!

339
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,080
Like Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense.

340
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,140
No one can see him.

341
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,740
It's not like he's dead.

342
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,780
But people are watching.

343
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,500
People are gathering!

344
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Show them the octopus.

345
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,120
You gotta do the kissy sounds.

346
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,295
Oh, from her bag...

347
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,140
She's taking something out.

348
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,660
She took out her cellphone!

349
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,160
Makeup touch-up.
- Sorry, it was a compact.

350
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Makeup touch-up.

351
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,960
Nevermind.

352
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,660
Stopped?

353
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,940
Did the octopus stop?

354
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,380
Can I do the Samba? They'll come if I do the Samba.

355
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,460
Can he do the Samba?

356
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,240
Ah, nice.

357
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,120
He's bringing a different rhythm.

358
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,340
He's out of breath...

359
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,120
Anyway, people are watching.

360
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,960
With all of your energy show us one more strong Samba!

361
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Nice!

362
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,580
Nice!

363
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,720
Gimme more!

364
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,520
Here it comes!

365
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,060
He's outta breath.

366
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,260
We're checking right now.

367
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,280
I have a feeling, it's coming.

368
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,080
They're gonna think a bird died.

369
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,920
Animal Control is gonna come.

370
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,620
Something big died.

371
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,320
Housei reaching his limit, ends his challenge.

372
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,320
He's back.

373
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,780
We're checking right now.

374
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,180
People were watching.

375
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,060
How was it?
- Um...no movement yet.

376
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,740
[Yamazaki Housei-san was at Odaiba. He was moving very strangely.]

377
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
"Moving strangely" is no good.

378
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,640
But there was mention of me. Yamazaki Housei is awesome!
- No, no, no...

379
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,240
So strict.

380
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,660
Afterwards, Tanaka who has yet to clear, does the Para Para.

381
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,320
He's flag signaling.

382
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,215
Look! The kids.

383
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:58,435
The kids are copying him.

384
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,980
This scene is fascinating.
- This is interesting.

385
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,300
Look! Look! Look!

386
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,300
What's going on?

387
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,580
What's goin on?

388
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,860
It turned into a kid's show.

389
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,120
Then Hamada attempts with the Awa Dance.

390
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,720
If they tweet now, that would be the best.

391
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,700
You're becoming more like Oka Hachiro.

392
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,300
However...

393
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,160
[Downtown's Hamachan was at Odaiba.]

394
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
No tweet of the dance name.

395
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,500
With that, here are the results.

396
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,460
Matsumoto and Endo only clear.

397
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,060
It's unfortunate but, the only one not to get their name tweeted was Tanaka.

398
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,220
Tanaka, batsu game.

399
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,680
Inverted crucifixion.

400
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,580
Inverted crucifixion?

401
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,280
I've never even heard of that.

402
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,120
Kimu has always been dealing with the record boss, Oozaki.
