1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,516
The following program was produced with
the utmost consideration toward safety

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,084
and features dangerous activities which
were supervised by stunt professionals.

3
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,687
Do not attempt to reenact any
of the activities performed.

4
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,160
The final round in this great battle

5
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,262
between Hamada's and Junior's armies
is about to begin.

6
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,163
Last Round

7
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,931
It will decide whose army
will reign supreme.

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:37,905
You Will Die,

9
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,407
round four.

10
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,176
Sumo Death!

11
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,411
YOU WILL DIE, ROUND 4
SUMO DEATH

12
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,278
What?

13
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,113
-"You will die"?
-We're definitely going to die?

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,681
They're telling us we'll die.

15
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,751
Wrestle each other with your cars

16
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,620
and push the opponent out of bounds

17
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,455
or force them to retire.

18
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,390
Really?

19
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,858
He was eating steak earlier.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,796
-Really?
-Let him eat whatever he likes.

21
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,631
-You were watching him eat?
-Yep.

22
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:04,932
"Sumo Death Laws"

23
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,201
The competitor who pushes their opponent
out of the square

24
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,870
or forces them to retire
will be victorious.

25
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,708
The two armies will use their remaining
battle cars in a judo-style tournament.

26
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,043
The army that annihilates
the other army's battle cars

27
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,778
will be heralded as the victors.

28
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,346
The losing army

29
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,017
must sacrifice the life
of one of their foot soldiers.

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,588
-One of us is getting killed?
-Killed?

31
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,356
What do you mean we're getting killed?

32
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,258
One foot soldier will be killed.

33
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,060
By foot soldiers, they mean us right?

34
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,261
We're the foot soldiers.

35
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,130
-They're going to kill us?
-What do you mean?

36
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,531
We're getting executed?

37
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,468
Here are the battle cars
for Junior's army.

38
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,635
Junior's Army
Battle cars

39
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,971
In the "Road to Hell" round...

40
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:48,175
Look at that. The front of the Jaguar
is falling apart!

41
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,010
The front of Matsuoka's car is damaged.

42
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,112
The Jaguar was forced to retire.

43
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,952
At the end of the Romantic Flight round,
the Audi had to be retired.

44
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,557
Once the cars take flight,
they are automatically forced to retire.

45
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,394
Plus, since they lost
the Romantic Flight round,

46
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,397
they had the Mercedes taken away
by Hamada's army.

47
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,266
Junior's Army

48
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,834
This means they now
have five cars remaining.

49
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,872
They must fight the pervert barbarian
from Osaka with this fleet of battle cars.

50
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,007
Volvo V70, BMW 330i, Mercedes-Benz S320,
Alfa Romeo Alfa GT, Lincoln Navigator

51
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,677
Here are the battle cars
for Hamada's army.

52
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,679
Hamada's Army
Battle cars

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,549
Due to the fierce battle
during the Road to Hell round,

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,789
the Toyota Century was forced to retire.

55
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,760
The front of the Century has sustained
a lot of damage.

56
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,265
In the same Road to Hell round...

57
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:50,304
He can't stop. He can't stop!
Is he okay?

58
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,840
The car is on its roof! Is Sata okay?

59
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,479
Yamamoto's beloved Beetle
was also retired.

60
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,550
Plus, in the Romantic Flight round...

61
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,920
Whoa! That was amazing!

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,188
It bounced off the other cars
to cover more distance!

63
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,725
The Nissan Fairlady Z was retired
at the end of this round.

64
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:14,728
Hamada's Army

65
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,330
Now they have six battle cars remaining.

66
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,331
Nissan Fuga, Toyota Celsior,
Nissan Skyline,

67
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,198
Honda Crossroad, Toyota Corolla Van,
Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Kompressor

68
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,567
They have a numerical advantage
over Junior's army.

69
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,602
But Junior's army has...

70
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:22,870
Monster

71
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,838
...a monster in their army.

72
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,316
We've got the Volvo, Alfa Romeo,
BMW, Mercedes,

73
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,884
and the Lincoln remaining.

74
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,119
We've still got the Lincoln.

75
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,155
The Lincoln will do well here.

76
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:41,922
Lincoln Navigator
Weight 2500kg - 304 hp

77
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,290
It's really powerful.

78
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,759
It's a matter of
who will drive the Lincoln.

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,528
Right.

80
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,929
But up until now...

81
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,498
Mr. Muto's been driving it thus far.

82
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,534
The driver's seat is on the left as well.

83
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,136
I think it would be hard
if you weren't used to it.

84
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,673
However, I might be able to beat
all of their cars all by myself.

85
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,841
All right, then!

86
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:01,909
It's fine, let's go!

87
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,611
That's fine. Let's do that.

88
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,113
Why don't you all go have some tea then?

89
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,247
Yeah.

90
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,415
You'll pummel them all, then.

91
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,216
Right.

92
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,150
Lincoln Navigator
New car price 10 million yen

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,952
The giant from Junior's army,

94
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,988
the Lincoln Navigator.

95
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,956
It weighs 2.5 tons.

96
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,361
It's such a sturdy car that it is
often used to move VIPs in the U.S.

97
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,464
It is, without a doubt, the strongest
weapon that Junior's army possess.

98
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,466
Engine 5.4L V8DOHC / 304 hp / AWD / AT / 2500kg

99
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,302
We have six cars
compared to five for them.

100
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,036
Right.

101
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,372
It would be troublesome

102
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,240
if they bring out that car
from the outset.

103
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,742
You mean Muto's Lincoln?

104
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:35,509
Yeah.

105
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:38,278
If that happens, we'll need to pummel
that car in the first half

106
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,981
so we can end up winning in the end.

107
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,483
By the way, Nagisa...

108
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,217
Yes?

109
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,451
About your car,

110
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,987
do you want to fight in it personally,
or give it to someone else?

111
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,288
The Fuga.

112
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,089
Right.

113
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,159
It doesn't matter who drives the car,
so...

114
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,360
Yes...

115
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,665
I do want to drive it myself, but...

116
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,399
Right.

117
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,267
I really want to win this battle.

118
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,068
I see.

119
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,202
That being the case,

120
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,872
I want to let the person who's been saying
they wanted to drive the Fuga

121
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,407
from the beginning drive it.

122
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,509
-Mr. Ozawa?
-Me?

123
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,343
Yes.

124
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,246
What will you do, Mr. Ozawa?
They are Nagisa's feelings, after all.

125
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,647
He was saying that all along.

126
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,615
Are you sure?

127
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,051
In that case, I'll deliver the final blow
using your car.

128
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,853
What do you mean by final blow?

129
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,854
You need to win first.

130
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:21,622
You just have to win.

131
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,823
I'll win.

132
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,325
They're going to bring out
Muto's Lincoln first.

133
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,494
I've lost two in a row
to the Lincoln today.

134
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,196
Right, you can't lose for a third time.

135
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,798
I need to give a good final performance.

136
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,499
Hey!

137
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,169
What are you going to do?

138
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,539
What do you mean? We're going to fight!

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,008
Are you giving up?

140
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,710
Of course not!

141
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,478
We've already decided.

142
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,280
We're going with

143
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,349
the Lincoln.

144
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,319
There, see!

145
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,289
We're starting off with the best!

146
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,492
Seriously?

147
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,827
But they're finished if we defeat him.

148
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,428
That's true.

149
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,563
Are you sure?

150
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,630
Yes, the Lincoln.

151
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,364
All right!

152
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,632
We're going to trample your team.

153
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,701
Nagisa, are you okay to send the Fuga?

154
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,636
Yes, let's send the Fuga!

155
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,571
Really?

156
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,272
The Fuga?

157
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,307
Yes, the Fuga.

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,710
You've already lost the fight!

159
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,079
No, no.

160
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,681
We don't know that yet.

161
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,583
The driver is

162
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,551
the man with a face that could kill!

163
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,955
The Century broke down, so...

164
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:28,722
It's not Mr. Hamada?

165
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,857
Lincoln Navigator
New car price 10 million yen

166
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,892
Representing Junior's army, Keiji Muto.

167
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,260
His battle car is

168
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,928
the Lincoln Navigator.

169
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,164
Engine 5.4L V8DOHC / 304 hp / AWD / AT / Weight 2500kg

170
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,098
Nissan Fuga
New car price approx. 5.7 million yen

171
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:38,966
Representing Hamada's army,

172
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:39,767
Hitoshi Ozawa.

173
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,136
His battle car is Nagisa's car,

174
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,504
the Nissan Fuga.

175
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,605
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1680kg

176
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,306
That is a Nissan Fuga.

177
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,074
Fuga.

178
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,378
Nagisa was duped into buying
the Nissan Fuga by Hamada's army.

179
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,414
It's really similar to the car

180
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,150
that my ex-boyfriend had,

181
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,584
so it feels really familiar.

182
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,887
It feels natural and comfortable.

183
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:04,258
Now, through this smoke-like dust,
the small red Mercedes tries to catch up.

184
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,860
The back of the Fuga
is still under attack!

185
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,930
Only one month after being purchased,

186
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,066
the Fuga that has worked hard for Hamada

187
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,069
is now up against
the strongest opponent there is.

188
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,972
-Hey, Nagisa.
-Yes?

189
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,542
Sorry your time with it was so short.

190
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,210
It really was.

191
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,178
You've only driven it twice, right?

192
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,413
I've only driven it twice.

193
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,483
It's only been a month since I bought it.

194
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,920
You must have been so excited
before you went to bed last night.

195
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,789
That's right.

196
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,991
I was really enjoying it
this morning, too. The weather was great,

197
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,793
so I thought it would be
a great day to go for a drive.

198
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,731
For the ending of our show, Tokyo Drive,
I was planning

199
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,567
to go to my hometown in Amagasaki.

200
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,734
I see.

201
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,772
Lincoln Navigator versus Nissan Fuga.

202
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,274
The difference in weight is 820 kilograms.

203
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,211
Nissan Fuga
(Hamada's army, 1680 kg, 280 hp)

204
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,078
Lincoln Navigator
(Junior's army, 2500 kg, 304 hp)

205
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,047
Will Hamada's army annihilate
their opponents

206
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,682
and take Junior's castle?

207
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,017
This is the final round.

208
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,352
You Will Die, round four.

209
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,553
Sumo Death!

210
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,224
Out of all the battle cars
that competed in previous rounds,

211
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,460
this round will be fought by the cars that
managed to survive the first three rounds.

212
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,561
The unbeatable Pro Wrestling Master
Keiji Muto

213
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,796
Muto will be up first.

214
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,731
I think the one who stomps
the accelerator wins.

215
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,236
But the one driving the other car
is Mr. Ozawa.

216
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,372
Yeah, he's a big fan
of the frontal assault.

217
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,375
Come on.

218
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,109
Here's Ozawa.

219
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,510
The man with a face that could kill
Hitoshi Ozawa

220
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,879
Just you wait.

221
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,616
I'll fight with everything I've got.

222
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,819
I will pummel him.

223
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,754
Bring me my weapons!

224
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,957
I wonder if he's up
to his old tricks again.

225
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,894
Ozawa's got a bazooka.

226
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,061
What?

227
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,865
What's that on his left shoulder?
It's a bazooka!

228
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,134
Now he's armed himself with a bazooka!

229
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,038
I can't win unless I use
all the weapons I've got.

230
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,808
He doesn't get the point of this battle,
does he?

231
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,049
Wow, it's so big.

232
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,017
Come on.

233
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,886
It's got a lot of presence.

234
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:13,954
It really does.

235
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,155
Mr. Muto.

236
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:15,889
Yes?

237
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,791
How do you feel facing him?

238
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,726
I feel very confident
after seeing their car.

239
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,460
I see.

240
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,931
Please chat amongst yourselves.

241
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,366
I see.

242
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,736
Please don't be so aggressive
that you hurt yourself.

243
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,570
Just hang on.

244
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,606
You mean he might get away from me?

245
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,842
The field isn't too wide,
I don't think that's going to happen.

246
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,576
Because you're close to each other?

247
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,311
Yes.

248
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,680
This leopard print thing
is really annoying.

249
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,150
Can you take it off?

250
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,852
What's your strategy?

251
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,722
I'll avoid hitting him head on.

252
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,557
-I see.
-Right.

253
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,593
I'll avoid him, then attack
with grenades and the bazooka.

254
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:55,996
As expected.

255
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,565
Then I'll attack from behind!

256
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,703
As expected, they're familiar
with the ways of battle.

257
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,906
Keiji Muto is used to being in battles.

258
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,674
Let's go!

259
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,177
-Come on!
-All right!

260
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,412
The battle between
the Lincoln Navigator...

261
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,714
Stare-off.

262
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,217
...and Ozawa in Nagisa's Nissan Fuga
begins now!

263
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,919
Ready, fight!

264
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,689
Ozawa has gone left.
What does Muto do?

265
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,691
He doesn't slam into Ozawa.

266
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,793
He pushes Ozawa slowly.

267
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,628
Slowly.

268
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,697
You're doing well!

269
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,566
Push, push!

270
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,268
One loses when a tire goes out of bounds.

271
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,371
Muto's Lincoln Navigator

272
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,573
shows us the power
of a four-wheel drive vehicle!

273
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,646
You can't let him push you!
Reverse, reverse!

274
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,883
What's that? It's a grenade!

275
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,287
He's already using a grenade on him.
Ozawa's laughing! Such an evil laugh!

276
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,556
It hasn't exploded yet. Now it does!

277
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,759
It exploded underneath the Lincoln.

278
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,260
Did he do it?

279
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,229
It exploded!

280
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,530
Go! Go!

281
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,631
That's dangerous!

282
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,769
In the meantime, Ozawa has reversed

283
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,204
and nudges Muto's side.

284
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,841
They're laughing!

285
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,677
Now Muto has taken the center position.

286
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,050
Wow, the front of Nagisa's white Fuga

287
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,985
is getting more and more damaged.

288
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,386
Let's go, Muto!

289
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,120
Go, go!

290
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,455
Come on!

291
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,693
Will he run or turn around?
He has turned his back!

292
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,096
Muto's going to push him out.

293
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,465
Will Ozawa be beaten by the power
of the four-wheel drive?

294
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,001
He's turned the steering to negate that.

295
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,171
It seems to have little effect
against this monster.

296
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,174
He's managed to escape!
They exchange positions.

297
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,142
Can he take the back position? No...

298
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,678
Wow, it has sustained more damage!

299
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,850
Mr. Ozawa!

300
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,552
Come on!

301
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,122
Muto tries to reverse to get into position
to push Ozawa out.

302
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,191
But Ozawa tries to block him.

303
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,459
Muto nudges the side of Ozawa's car.

304
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,596
Muto's going for it now.

305
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,599
A battle between a 54-year-old
and a 55-year-old.

306
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,134
He's brought out the bazooka!

307
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,736
The bazooka exploded in the car!

308
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,472
And Muto pushes Ozawa out of bounds!

309
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,307
WIN Lincoln (frontal push out)
Nissan Fuga

310
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,613
The bazooka exploded in the car!

311
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,182
What the hell happened?

312
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,283
Useless bazooka.

313
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,419
What happened?

314
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,620
What just happened?

315
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,622
It exploded in the car!

316
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,057
Come on!

317
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,927
Junior's army wins.

318
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,129
Muto wins!

319
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,700
Once again,

320
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,069
Ozawa has experienced
an explosion in his car.

321
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,170
SENTOSHA

322
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,173
Here, Ozawa takes out his bazooka

323
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,075
as he tried desperately
to turn the tide of the match.

324
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,209
But, unfortunately...

325
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,446
Right there!

326
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,716
It has worked against him again!

327
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:10,590
Therefore, Muto from Junior's army
wins the first battle.

328
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:12,893
SENTOSHA

329
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,100
The bazooka exploded in the car.

330
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,135
That'll impair your vision.

331
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,373
Why did it explode in the car?

332
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,508
He could've gotten away
if he hadn't used the bazooka.

333
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,043
Are you okay to keep going?

334
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,878
No problem at all!

335
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,547
I can keep going till the end!

336
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,948
Go ahead!

337
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,350
I'm not going to worry
about making the show dramatic,

338
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,818
and just keep winning, okay?

339
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,453
-That's fine!
-Right.

340
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,490
-It's still alive, Nagisa.
-Right.

341
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,424
You can still drive it.

342
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,926
You can drive home in it.

343
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,060
You can drive it home today.

344
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:47,794
Yeah.

345
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,496
But it looks so battered.

346
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,231
My weapons didn't work for me today.

347
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,567
You fired a bazooka in my car.

348
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,202
That really was amazing.

349
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,672
From this battle, Hamada's army has lost
one of their battle cars.

350
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,408
The two armies begin the second battle
with five cars each.

351
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,777
SENTOSHA
5 vs 5

352
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,649
What are we going to do?

353
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:14,120
How about we keep slamming Muto
on the driver's side?

354
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,889
And then we'll get Muto...

355
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,992
We'll kill off Muto first.

356
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,127
That's too cruel.

357
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,029
Let's smash them, okay?

358
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,130
Yeah!

359
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,031
Yeah!

360
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,468
Why are you making him do it?

361
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,837
That's a phrase he made famous!

362
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,571
Yeah!

363
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,874
Iwahashi, what do you want to do?
Do you want to drive yourself?

364
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:40,714
I'd be happy to let anyone drive
if they wanted to...

365
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,084
But it's your car full of family memories.

366
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,819
You should drive it yourself.

367
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,387
You've driven over someone already.

368
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,121
Right.

369
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,689
What's with that?

370
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:50,724
Just get on top.

371
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,458
I'll do it.

372
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,693
Do it for us.

373
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,429
You just need to get on top
of the Lincoln.

374
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,998
Do you have any advice for me?

375
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,165
Rather than taking him head on...

376
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,533
I should attack him from the side?

377
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,434
Yes.

378
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,971
Like Ozawa did earlier,
you can squeeze past to get around him.

379
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,339
I see.

380
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,874
Ozawa got around him a few times.

381
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,509
The rest is up to horsepower.

382
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,377
Okay.

383
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,279
We're going with...

384
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,214
Iwahashi!

385
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,182
No problem!

386
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,484
We'll call a doctor.

387
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,918
Think we can't win?

388
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,921
We'll take on anyone or anything!

389
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,190
We're sending out the Honda Crossroad!

390
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:25,859
Awesome.

391
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,593
A four-wheel drive?

392
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,561
He'll do it for his family!

393
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,529
Honda Crossroad
New car price 2.9 million yen

394
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,431
The uncontrollable hitman,

395
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,400
Yoshimasa Iwahashi.

396
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,001
His battle car is

397
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,004
the Crossroad packed
full of family memories.

398
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,773
Engine 1.8L SOHC / 140 hp / 4WD / Weight 1480kg

399
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,510
I want to keep it well maintained.

400
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,945
I really want to drive it
for a very long time.

401
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:46,746
A very long time?

402
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,748
Yeah, my wife loves this car as well.

403
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,150
Is that so?

404
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,217
Yeah.

405
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,521
Iwahashi was also duped into
joining Hamada's army.

406
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,123
But, as the competition progressed,

407
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,526
Iwahashi awakened as a battle car racer.

408
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,095
Iwahashi attacks from behind!

409
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,032
He's driving up the side of Shoji's car!

410
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,967
Iwahashi completely drove
on top of Shoji's car!

411
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,437
Damn it!

412
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,240
Although they are both
four-wheel drive cars,

413
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,744
the difference in weight
is 1,020 kilograms.

414
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,715
Is it a four-wheel drive, too?

415
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,717
It's a four-wheel drive!

416
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,952
These kinds of cars are tough!

417
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,055
He might climb on top of that car again.

418
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,993
Muto, please be careful
of their sideways attack.

419
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,262
Yeah, I know.

420
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,664
He'll be coming to get you on the inside.

421
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,398
Right.

422
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,701
This is his own car, isn't it?

423
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,869
Don't worry about that.

424
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,137
I don't have to worry?

425
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:44,871
No, you don't.

426
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,005
I understand.

427
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:46,740
Yeah!

428
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:47,741
Yeah!

429
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,642
You shouldn't do that!

430
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,578
It makes me feel sorry for him.

431
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,747
I clocked up 30,000 kilometers
in two and a half years.

432
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:54,848
The uncontrollable hitman
Yoshimasa Iwahashi

433
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,082
I've got a lot of memories in this car.

434
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,052
I took my family to the Atami hot springs
in this car.

435
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:03,089
I drove my wife's parents
in this car as well.

436
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:10,697
Salary.

437
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,265
Zero.

438
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,302
If we could just get rid
of that Lincoln...

439
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:22,342
This is a battle between Muto
in the American car with a powerful engine

440
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,779
versus Iwahashi in the Honda Crossroad.

441
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,581
Here, Muto sits proudly
in his Lincoln Navigator.

442
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,954
Thank you!

443
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,490
Iwahashi shows his appreciation
for his car

444
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,692
full of wonderful memories
with his family.

445
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,129
He must have realized this could be
the end for this car.

446
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,798
Muto, on the other hand,
looks very confident.

447
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,770
Now, Iwahashi prepares himself

448
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,606
to risk his life with the Crossroad.

449
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,210
Come on!

450
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,879
-It's his own car, right?
-Right.

451
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,282
Yeah, it's his own car.

452
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,083
Muto might be in trouble if he gets hit
from the side.

453
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:06,786
Honda Crossroad
(Hamada's army, 1480 kg, 140 hp)

454
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:07,587
Lincoln Navigator
(Junior's army, 2500 kg, 304 hp)

455
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,989
Have a look at them,
they are both four-wheel drives.

456
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,692
It's like a lightweight champion
versus a giant.

457
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,527
Their size difference is quite evident.

458
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,229
We're now ready for battle.

459
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,900
Stare-off.

460
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,770
Ready...

461
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:24,571
Go!

462
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,772
Fight!

463
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,908
Now, Iwahashi turns to the left.

464
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,077
Iwahashi has exposed his side
for Muto to attack!

465
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,012
The door is getting pummeled.

466
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,547
Tough it out!

467
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,286
Will Muto finish him off in one go?

468
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,388
The Lincoln Navigator
is pushing him steadily.

469
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,692
The left wheel!
The left wheel goes out of bounds.

470
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,759
Junior's army wins.

471
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,627
WIN Lincoln (frontal push out)
Honda Crossroad

472
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,929
Muto pushes Iwahashi out of bounds.
That's two wins in a row for Muto!

473
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,966
Yeah!

474
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,934
That was quick!

475
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,668
Really quick!

476
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,769
Yeah!

477
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,438
Such a quick victory!

478
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,474
He was waiting for us to make a move.

479
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,809
Yeah.

480
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,377
He's watching us carefully.

481
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,012
You can't let him take you from the side.

482
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,547
That's right. That's it.

483
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,117
He stopped after going to the left
and let him attack from the side.

484
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,087
He should've kept going
and taken him from the other side.

485
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,489
Shit!

486
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,159
SENTOSHA

487
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,263
From the outset,
when Iwahashi turned to the left,

488
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,532
he exposed the right side
of his car to Muto.

489
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,100
This ultimately led to his defeat.

490
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,770
Along with the memories of his family,
the Crossroad starts to crumple up.

491
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,740
In the end, it couldn't withstand
the sheer force of the Lincoln

492
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,710
and the left rear wheel went out of bounds
and the match was over.

493
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,280
Muto and Junior's army win two in a row!

494
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,582
Junior's army wins.

495
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,651
SENTOSHA

496
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,254
The opponents are getting weaker
and weaker.

497
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,493
Hamada's army now has four cars remaining.

498
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,397
Is it impossible to defeat
this monster vehicle?

499
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,364
SENTOSHA
5 vs 4

500
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,632
How about you, Yamamoto?

501
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:00,633
All right!

502
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,834
Shit.

503
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,436
I'll take the Corolla.

504
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,805
The Corolla, right?

505
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,906
You don't know what will happen.

506
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,141
It's hard if he doesn't let you
take him side on.

507
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:08,908
I'm not sure what to do.

508
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,511
Can you take him from underneath?

509
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,412
Yamamoto, maybe.

510
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,247
I'll wait and see what he does.

511
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:14,981
Good.

512
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,850
That's right.
We always make the first move.

513
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,119
I'll think about what to do
after he makes his move.

514
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,020
That's a good idea.

515
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:21,988
We'll see what Muto wants to do.

516
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:22,789
Right.

517
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,057
Making him surrender would also work.

518
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,992
Toyota Corolla Van
New car price 1.5 million yen

519
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,728
Resurrected after ten years,
the Golden Boy,

520
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,430
Keiichi Yamamoto.

521
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,865
His battle car is the Toyota Corolla Van.

522
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,034
Engine 1.3L I4 DOHC / 82 hp / FF / 4MT / Weight 930kg

523
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,271
The weight difference between the two cars

524
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,139
is an astounding 1,570 kilograms.

525
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,613
This delivery van

526
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,281
is Yamamoto's battle car

527
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:53,219
which defeated Harada's Audi
in the Road to Hell round.

528
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,592
Yamamoto had his beloved Beetle wrecked.

529
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,062
Now, his Beetle is destined
for the scrap heap.

530
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,163
Resurrected after ten years of silence,
the Golden Boy, Keiichi Yamamoto

531
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,268
Sata's back.

532
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,003
Hey.

533
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:10,870
How is everything?

534
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,374
Sata, who underwent
a medical assessment returns.

535
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,677
We were worried about you.

536
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,078
I've just got some bruising.
I'm okay because I work out a lot.

537
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,279
Yamamoto's going to fight now.

538
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,948
Who's fighting?

539
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,651
We're up against the Lincoln.

540
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,020
Sorry, but, can we use your car?

541
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:27,754
No way!

542
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:30,490
It's not happening!

543
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:35,161
Have a look at this.
The difference in power is evident.

544
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,996
Does that delivery van even have a chance?

545
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,698
The cars are so different.

546
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,000
The cars are too different.

547
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:45,938
I have no intention
of taking him on directly.

548
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,106
Yeah!

549
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:53,379
Yamamoto, let's wait and see, okay?

550
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:54,714
Understood.

551
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,315
Thank you.

552
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:58,851
Hamada!

553
00:21:58,918 --> 00:21:59,719
Yeah?

554
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,588
You're going to fight us with that car?

555
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,025
Just look at it.

556
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,260
It's a delivery van.

557
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,729
You never know!

558
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,265
It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger
versus Danny DeVito.

559
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,134
You can't underestimate a Toyota.

560
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,904
How's Keiji Muto's knee holding up?

561
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,907
Isn't he giving up already?

562
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,743
Don't make fun of his knee!

563
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,680
Then let's do it even more.

564
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,751
Now, this is literally

565
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,253
David versus Goliath.

566
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:35,755
Yes.

567
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,157
It's okay if I win in one move
like last time, right?

568
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,259
Muto, how are you feeling?

569
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,627
I'm very confident.

570
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:42,562
Yeah!

571
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,296
Yeah!

572
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,631
Stop it! It's sad!

573
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,901
Toyota Corolla Van (Hamada's army, 930 kg, 82 hp) vs
Lincoln Navigator (Junior's army, 2500 kg, 304 hp)

574
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,269
It's time for the battle to commence.

575
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,774
Wait and see. Just wait and see.

576
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:55,508
Watch.

577
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,577
It's scary if they get desperate.

578
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,481
Stare-off.

579
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,850
Ready.

580
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,218
Go!

581
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:05,952
Come on!

582
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:06,619
What will he do?

583
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:09,555
They start slowly this time.

584
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,691
Muto attacks straight on!

585
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,195
He pushes and pushes.

586
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,264
Muto takes Yamamoto out of bounds
in one big push!

587
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,398
He pushes and pushes.

588
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,601
Muto takes Yamamoto out of bounds
in one big push!

589
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,735
He pushes and pushes.

590
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,737
Muto takes Yamamoto out of bounds
in one big push!

591
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,272
Junior's army wins.

592
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,507
Yeah!

593
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,574
WIN Lincoln (frontal push out)
Corolla Van

594
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,343
It really is something else.

595
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,077
It's the strongest!

596
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,779
It's done!

597
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:34,814
Instant death!

598
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,618
It's three wins in a row for Muto!

599
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,087
There was nothing Yamamoto could do.

600
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,356
The front has crumpled up, too!

601
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,992
You're kidding!

602
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,562
This keeps on happening!

603
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:50,830
This is impossible!

604
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,399
It's like Goliath.

605
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,400
We're up against a heavyweight!

606
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,636
How could that happen?

607
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,207
SENTOSHA

608
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,976
In the beginning,
Yamamoto steered to the left

609
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,445
and tried to go around Muto,

610
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,381
but Muto took no notice of that
and attacked straight on.

611
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,083
This is just the difference in ability

612
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,785
between a four-wheel drive
and delivery van.

613
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,288
The difference in power is evident here.

614
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,191
To protect Junior's castle,
the monster wreaks havoc!

615
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,725
It's three in a row for Muto!

616
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,196
They're so weak!

617
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,797
The Lincoln is so strong.

618
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,767
Three cars left, right?

619
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,904
The champion Lincoln wins three in a row.

620
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,440
Hamada only has three cars left.

621
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,042
SENTOSHA
5 vs 3

622
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,045
A grand battle

623
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,546
between battle cars.

624
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,849
This battle will conclude

625
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,450
when one army
has no battle cars remaining.

626
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,321
Your turn, Juichi.

627
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:49,789
Let's go.

628
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:50,623
It's gotta be you.

629
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,226
What's our strategy?

630
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,896
Can you start really quickly and go around
to his driver's side?

631
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,930
I see.

632
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,766
We couldn't do anything last time,
when we waited for him to attack.

633
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,634
Right.

634
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,035
We have to make a move.

635
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,036
So we go around to the driver's side?

636
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,005
That's the left side, right?
So, I go forward...

637
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,841
I go left then go around to the right.

638
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:09,709
I see.

639
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,777
It was impossible.

640
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:12,511
Yeah, we know.

641
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,579
I was watching him...

642
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,816
He had a smile on his face when
he was driving straight at me.

643
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,887
I tried to avoid him
but there was nothing I could do.

644
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:21,787
It was hopeless.

645
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,056
He came slowly at me, laughing.

646
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,425
It's impossible.

647
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,028
I'll try to avoid him as much as possible.

648
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:29,762
Right.

649
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,530
I'll give it a good go.

650
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,899
Good luck!

651
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:34,133
Nissan Skyline
New car price 3.1 million yen

652
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,702
The best driver in a thousand years
according to himself,

653
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,070
Juichi Wakisaka.

654
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,238
Engine 2.5L I6 DOHC / 200 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1400kg

655
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,173
His battle car is a Nissan Skyline

656
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,009
with bamboo-spear mufflers,

657
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,610
it's a car modified to suit hooligans
from Chiba and Ibaraki.

658
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,415
The difference in weight
between the Skyline

659
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,484
and the Navigator is 1,100 kilograms.

660
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,954
Nissan Skyline
(Hamada's army, 1400kg, 200 hp)

661
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:55,821
Lincoln Navigator
(Junior's army, 2500kg, 304 hp)

662
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,258
Junior's army's champion,
the Lincoln Navigator, keeps picking off

663
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,993
the battle cars from Hamada's army
one by one.

664
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:04,497
The next driver, Juichi Wakisaka,
is one we have high expectations from.

665
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,766
There's not much I can do

666
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,334
The best driver in a thousand years
(according to himself) - Juichi Wakisaka

667
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,702
if he catches me from the side.

668
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,837
I can't help it.

669
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,675
Here's Muto in his Lincoln Navigator.

670
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:17,510
Look at him.

671
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,912
He looks very much like
a sumo wrestling champion.

672
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:20,980
The unbeatable pro wrestling master
Keiji Muto

673
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,683
I'll make it a good battle.

674
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,656
He does look confident, Juichi Wakisaka.

675
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:32,792
Mr. Hamada?

676
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:34,560
Yes?

677
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,529
The Lincoln is really big!

678
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,533
Of course, we knew that.

679
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,169
We've been saying how cute you are,
Mr. Muto.

680
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,370
Really?

681
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,039
Did Akina say that, too?

682
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,407
No, not Akina.

683
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,475
She didn't?

684
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,577
Akina is the only one who hasn't.

685
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,112
It's just Akina.

686
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,681
Only Akina? That's a shock.

687
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,516
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

688
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,954
Muto has just been sitting in his car.

689
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:02,688
Yup.

690
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,390
He just needs to step on
the accelerator a little, and that's it.

691
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,124
Yup.

692
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,727
There's not much damage
to his knee either.

693
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,930
Juichi is planning to feint
towards the left,

694
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,132
then go around to the right
and attack the side of the Lincoln.

695
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:18,237
Can Juichi defeat the champion by showing
us his technique as a race car driver?

696
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,610
In this Sumo Death round,

697
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,246
the self-proclaimed
once-in-a-thousand-years driver

698
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,016
will take on the pro wrestling master.

699
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,121
-Here we go!
-Come on.

700
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,022
Show us your technique!

701
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,256
They're ready.

702
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,591
Stare off.

703
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,725
All right!

704
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,927
Ready...

705
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,462
Fight!

706
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,232
Juichi Wakisaka feints left as planned,

707
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,401
then he goes around to the right.

708
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,202
He has managed to get beside Muto,
as planned.

709
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,637
He's good!

710
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,505
He's done well!

711
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,607
What does he do now?

712
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,109
Juichi is right beside Muto.

713
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,812
Once in this position,
Muto is unable to attack.

714
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,950
Hey, Shigekazu! What do I do now?

715
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,218
What should he do?

716
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,721
Is Muto panicking a little?

717
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,558
Muto is panicking a bit.

718
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,298
Juichi Wakisaka is starting
to control this match.

719
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,299
Look out, look out!

720
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,837
When Muto makes a move,

721
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,339
Juichi also moves to run parallel to Muto.

722
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,875
Muto can't escape from this position.

723
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:32,878
It's looking good...

724
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:33,612
It's good.

725
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,882
There is no escape in sight for Muto.

726
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,251
It's really impressive to watch.

727
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,521
Juichi Wakisaka shows us
his technique right here.

728
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,091
Good.

729
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,127
Muto is forced to make a move.

730
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,298
And again,
Juichi positions himself to the side.

731
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,799
Look out!

732
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:56,836
Juichi is beside Muto.

733
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,238
He is trying to frustrate Muto. Wait!

734
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:03,075
Will he take Juichi from the side?
No! That's great driving!

735
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,377
Juichi reverses to the other side.
Magnificent!

736
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:11,784
Wow, he avoided that well.

737
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,518
Yeah.

738
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:18,124
Juichi Wakisaka is frustrating
the champion, Muto.

739
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:22,161
What does he do now? He reverses again.
The wheel spins.

740
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,730
Muto crashes into him from the side!

741
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,066
Juichi's in trouble!
His goggles are falling off.

742
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,069
Look out!

743
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,470
Reverse, reverse!

744
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,571
Come on!

745
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,739
Go, go!

746
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,308
Muto, the champion,

747
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,344
is now in a winning position.

748
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:39,945
From this position he pushes Juichi
out of bounds!

749
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:40,880
WIN Lincoln (frontal force out) - Skyline

750
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,515
Muto wins four in a row!

751
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,449
Junior's army wins.

752
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,452
Yeah!

753
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,920
So close!

754
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,488
Even though he tried so hard!

755
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,057
Well done, Mr. Muto!

756
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,059
Yes! I won.

757
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,461
Magnificent!

758
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,998
An amazing performance by Muto.

759
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,066
Wakisaka competed well,
but he couldn't overcome the champion.

760
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:04,937
SENTOSHA

761
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:06,705
Fight!

762
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,642
In the beginning,
Juichi feints left as expected

763
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,378
and positions himself right beside
the Lincoln's driver's side.

764
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,348
This seemed to frustrate Muto a lot.

765
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,385
Juichi was able to show us his technique
as a race car driver.

766
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,290
Here, it seemed Muto would take him
from the side,

767
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:25,991
but Juichi showed us his stuff.

768
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,761
From the side-by-side position,

769
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,530
Juichi couldn't move quickly enough
due to the wheel spinning,

770
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,866
and from then on, it was all Muto.

771
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,735
He didn't relinquish his advantage
and claimed victory.

772
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,505
Is he going to annihilate Hamada's army
one by one?

773
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:41,240
Muto wins four in a row!

774
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,276
We just can't attack him.

775
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:45,978
That's right.

776
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:47,012
Muto, you're amazing!

777
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,648
Come on!

778
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,650
It's because the car is amazing.

779
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,852
Mr. Muto is, too!

780
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,091
Hamada's army is on the verge of defeat.

781
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,593
Only two cars left.

782
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,261
SENTOSHA
5 vs 2

783
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,398
But the pervert barbarian
doesn't give up so easily.

784
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,535
Hamada goes for unusual tactics.

785
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:14,707
What if there were two of our cars?
What do you think?

786
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,275
-I see.
-It might work.

787
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,142
Right?

788
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,644
It will take away his concentration.

789
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,145
We'll send out our last two
for this match.

790
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,480
Can you still drive?

791
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,281
No problem.

792
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:23,515
We'll have Juichi and Seiji.

793
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,150
Seiji, you take the other car.

794
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,518
Me?

795
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:27,920
Let's go with two cars in the last match.

796
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:28,654
They're the strongest pair.

797
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,122
Excuse me.

798
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,523
Hey!

799
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,391
Junior's army?

800
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,162
We only have two cars left

801
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,498
and we can't really compete with
just one car,

802
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,568
so can we please fight with two cars?

803
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,638
What kind of way to ask
for a favor is that?

804
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,140
That's not good enough.

805
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,008
Right.

806
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,709
You're asking us
like it's only a suggestion.

807
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,443
Yeah.

808
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,813
I'm asking you nicely. Please.

809
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,981
How do you feel about that?

810
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,182
What?

811
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,319
You're asking us
while you're sitting down?

812
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:04,857
Look at him.

813
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,225
We're sorry to make you do this, master.

814
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,395
I represent all of us to say...

815
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:12,197
Please...

816
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,102
Please let us compete with
two cars in the final match!

817
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,537
We decline!

818
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,972
Come on!

819
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,240
Hey!

820
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,741
Our master is asking you!

821
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,311
All right, all right!

822
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:26,845
Okay, okay!

823
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,047
Okay?

824
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,281
Thank you very much!

825
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,349
All right!

826
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,550
We're sorry, master!

827
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,653
With a weight of 2.5 tons,

828
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,088
the invincible monster,

829
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,223
the Lincoln Navigator advances.

830
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,359
The two cars competing
from Hamada's army are...

831
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,563
New car price 8 million yen
Engine 4.3L V8 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1800kg

832
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:48,067
The Toyota Celsior, total weight 1.8 tons.

833
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,370
New car price approx. 4.8 million yen
Engine 2.3L I4 D HC Super Charger / 197 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1380 kg

834
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,472
Mercedes-Benz SLK Kompressor,

835
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,641
total weight 1.4 tons.

836
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,648
In the last round,

837
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,317
Hamada's army will compete with two cars

838
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,187
against Muto, the ultimate champion
from Junior's army.

839
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,291
Here are the battle cars

840
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:17,196
that lost their lives
during this grand battle at Mount Fuji.

841
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,130
War is such a cruel thing.

842
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,233
One army will claim victory

843
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,303
atop the sacrifices they made.

844
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,907
I'm going to attack
right from the beginning.

845
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,911
Here's the Chihara Family's mad dog,
Seiji Chihara.

846
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,784
Seiji Chihara's record today has been
impeccable, winning all three match ups.

847
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,054
Wow, look how close Seiji is!

848
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:43,956
Seiji won!

849
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,790
Round 1, stop at the very last moment
Win

850
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:45,691
Yeah!

851
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:46,692
Round 2, The Road to Hell - Win

852
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,161
The battle cars are ferociously jostling
for position.

853
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,963
Oh, the car has spun around!

854
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,531
It hit Fujimoto!

855
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,533
And here, Seiji completes the race.

856
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,301
Seiji from Hamada's army
has claimed victory!

857
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,403
Fly, Fairlady Z!

858
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,772
Whoa! That was amazing!

859
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,073
Round 3, Romantic Flight - Win

860
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,242
He bounces off the cushioning cars
and gains more distance!

861
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,214
Could the Chihara family's mad dog,

862
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,117
Seiji Chihara, bring about a miracle?

863
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,354
Are you okay, Mr. Muto?

864
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,724
I'm good. When I win,
can we organize a swingers party

865
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,595
with me and my wife
and Shoji and his wife?

866
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,234
He's just spouting crazy stuff now.

867
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:32,271
Can you organize a swingers party
if he wins?

868
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,139
Yeah!

869
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,441
Yeah!

870
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,709
He's joking right?

871
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:38,444
Well, Shoji said yes!

872
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,513
Who's getting in that car opposite Muto?

873
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:43,682
Seiji, at the moment.

874
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,117
Then, Seiji, use your headlights.

875
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,920
Put your headlights on high beam.

876
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,956
Blind him, okay?

877
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,259
That's a good idea.

878
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,894
On high beam.

879
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,062
Good tactics.

880
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,465
Take his eyes out.

881
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,499
That's good.

882
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,135
But that Mercedes is so small.

883
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:07,272
If Muto goes for Seiji first,

884
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:11,009
Seiji will fall and even if you attack him
from the side, it wouldn't move at all.

885
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,544
Yeah, we were just talking about that.

886
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,278
Right?

887
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:14,513
You put your headlights on high beam,

888
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,815
it will blind him,
so he probably won't move.

889
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:17,783
Yeah.

890
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,352
Then, how about we put the Mercedes
opposite the Lincoln

891
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,287
then I take him from the side?

892
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,322
I see.

893
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,990
Then I'll put my headlights on high beam.

894
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,091
Let's do that.

895
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:26,859
Yes.

896
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:30,295
Let's swap the positions of the two cars.

897
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,363
Right.

898
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:36,068
As expected, the pervert barbarian
is being his deceitful self.

899
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:39,872
As you can see, they are up to something.

900
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,108
They are swapping their cars around.

901
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,310
They've moved that car in front of me.

902
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:47,379
Junior!

903
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,113
Yes!

904
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,349
It's just a suggestion,

905
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,086
how about we make this the final battle?

906
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,422
The army that wins this match
will win the battle.

907
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,891
What?

908
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,359
Can you not count

909
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,027
the number of cars?

910
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,632
How many cars do you think we have?

911
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,600
We could run a secondhand car dealership
over here.

912
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:13,839
We'd just like to get the battle
over and done with.

913
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:18,210
No matter how it goes,
I can't see us losing this match.

914
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,478
Yeah.

915
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,979
Then it's no problem, right?

916
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,148
Yes, we'll accept!

917
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,818
Then it's the last match!

918
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:31,356
Everything will be decided here.

919
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,359
The Mercedes is so small.

920
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,530
I'm coming, Miki!

921
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,532
Is he really trying to sleep with my wife?

922
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,637
The car opposite the Lincoln
has its headlights on high beam.

923
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,872
It's Juichi Wakisaka.

924
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:55,614
On Muto's right is Seiji
in the black Celsior.

925
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,387
He's flashing his headlights.

926
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,426
The undefeated champion
from Junior's army, Muto.

927
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,896
Come on!

928
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,098
Let's see a complete victory!

929
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,633
The swingers party is coming up.

930
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,868
They've all got high beams on.

931
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:17,936
Trying to blind each other,

932
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:20,839
so they can't move freely.

933
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,074
That's right.

934
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,176
Can Junior's army

935
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:24,910
overcome Hamada's tactics?

936
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:26,311
Stare-off.

937
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,746
This is the final battle.
They've all got high beams on!

938
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,414
Ready!

939
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,816
Fight!

940
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,318
Here they go. Muto goes for Seiji!

941
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:37,389
Juichi's Mercedes pushes
against Muto's car.

942
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,459
But the Mercedes is not powerful enough
to move the Lincoln.

943
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,928
Push, push!

944
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,463
Take him from the side!

945
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,199
In the meantime, where is Seiji?

946
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,268
Seiji and Juichi seem to be
in each other's way.

947
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,739
It's hard for him to take a direct hit.

948
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,712
The man with a full beam
in his face is Juichi.

949
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,114
He gives instructions to Seiji
to come around.

950
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,218
Take him from the side!

951
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,321
And here's Seiji's Celsior!

952
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,361
Even Muto must be concerned
about having to counter two cars.

953
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,830
But his car is so much more powerful.

954
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,432
The Lincoln Navigator.

955
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,633
That's so dangerous!

956
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,435
It's only a little further.

957
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:24,803
Go, go!

958
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,807
Now, it looks like he's going to deal
with Juichi's Mercedes first.

959
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,409
Its wheels are spinning like crazy!

960
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,444
Just a bit more!

961
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,278
Take him from the side!

962
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,113
Go! Go!

963
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,083
Will he go out of bounds?

964
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,687
But now Seiji attacks him from this side!

965
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:45,757
Seiji smashes him from behind!

966
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,260
Seiji has hit Muto in the rear wheels.

967
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,962
The suspension's broken!

968
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,965
The back wheels are gone!

969
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,367
All right!

970
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,368
Come on!

971
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,836
You're doing great, Seiji!

972
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,172
Seiji hits him again!

973
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,745
The mad dog strikes!
The wheel has fallen off!

974
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,947
With the wheel removed,

975
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,982
the chassis has touched the ground.

976
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,017
WIN Mercedes & Celsior (outside leg trip)
Lincoln

977
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,919
This means Muto is defeated!

978
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,887
Hamada's army wins.

979
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,625
Yes!

980
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,400
Yeah!

981
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,770
This was a great battle!

982
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,139
We won because Muto's wheel fell off.

983
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,379
Look at that!

984
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,048
What happened?

985
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,916
Hamada's army wins.

986
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:46,051
All right!

987
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,791
Wow, they won by wrecking Muto's car!

988
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:53,992
They have taken Junior's castle!

989
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,161
SENTOSHA

990
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,799
Here it is.

991
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:05,470
Seiji, who betrayed his own brother,
Junior, to join Hamada's army

992
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,473
shows us his mad dog qualities.

993
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,975
Right here!

994
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,845
Seiji cuts off Muto's leg!

995
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,348
And in that moment, the battle was over.

996
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,550
It's like Japan defeated the U.S.

997
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:21,920
Yeah!

998
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,055
You were great!

999
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,659
You were great!

1000
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,294
Amazing!

1001
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,329
Fantastic!

1002
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,931
You were great out there!

1003
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:36,401
Hey, Junior's army!

1004
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,969
Hey!

1005
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,805
After coming this far,

1006
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:41,840
a wheel falls off?

1007
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,576
Was it the back wheel?

1008
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,144
Yeah, the rear wheel.

1009
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,746
It's not even the front wheel.

1010
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,781
Yeah, the back wheel.

1011
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,886
Hamada's army is victorious
in this great battle.

1012
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,857
The losing army must sacrifice
one of their foot soldiers.

1013
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:02,861
That is the unbreakable rule
of battle cars.

1014
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,864
What's going on?

1015
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,666
I can't move an inch!

1016
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,768
Am I being sacrificed?

1017
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,469
Am I going to die?

1018
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:14,539
Muto, die!

1019
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,642
No!

1020
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:18,677
Boom.

1021
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:27,719
That's so hot!

1022
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:28,753
It's so hot!

1023
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:31,857
Muto's dead now.

1024
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:33,558
Dead indeed.

1025
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,034
Keiji Muto from Junior's army

1026
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:45,437
died in battle.

1027
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,239
He was 54.

1028
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,380
The remaining soldiers will be
made to live in disgrace.

1029
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,421
Who knew that the tire would fall off?

1030
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,290
Damn it!

1031
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,759
The cowards only aimed at the feet.

1032
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,161
They only aimed at the feet.

1033
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,430
So embarrassing.

1034
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,700
They've got some heavy pieces of stone
on their laps.

1035
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,673
Stop it.

1036
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:25,210
What's this?

1037
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,745
They're getting pelted with stones.

1038
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:30,348
Oh, no, I'd hate that.

1039
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,118
I feel so humiliated.

1040
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,352
Please stop!

1041
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,791
Damn it!

1042
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:40,525
That's terrible.

1043
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,667
Stop it!

1044
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:54,706
Fujimoto's getting peed on!

1045
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,111
I will never forget this
for the rest of my life!

1046
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,113
Never!

1047
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,417
Throw some more!

1048
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,619
Why just me?

1049
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,092
The names of these heroes

1050
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:18,029
were inscribed at the bottom
of Mount Fuji.

1051
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:24,502
Hamada's army wins Sentosha

1052
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,842
SENTOSHA: Battle Wheels
