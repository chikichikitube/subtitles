1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Why such a stern face all of a sudden?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Do you plan on scaling the final stretch of Mt Fuji from the 6th station?

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,754
You've got to be mistaken!

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,800
What do you mean?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Everyone has latent, secret hidden paranormal powers like clairvoyance and telepathy!

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,599
That maybe so....but I really don't know....

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Surely you've heard of pyschokinesis?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,399
Not really, what's it all about?

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Then surely, you must have heard of pyrokinesis!

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,600
Nope, never heard of that either!

11
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,149
That's when you set things on fire with your thoughts!

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,199
Oh really!

13
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:26,757
It's a kind of a paranormal ability!

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,300
Just by thinking hard about it....

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
..for example that guy over there....just by willing it, you could set his head on fire! Pooof!

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Wow! That's some power!

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
Yeah, isn't it? That's called pyrokinesis!

18
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,350
And then there's psychokinesis....and you've got all kinds of kinesises!

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll have you know, I too have a little bit of paranormal ability!

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,100
oh? And what's that?

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,250
Thing is, my paranormal ability is kinda low-key and inconspicuous!

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
So, it's not exactly the kind of thing you can brag to people about!

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
And it's also really hard to get them to believe that I have this paranormal power!

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, why don't you give everyone a demonstration before our eyes then? You should be able to move some things around by willing it, right?

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Ok, let's see....take this wagon here for example....

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,200
Would you mind pushing this wagon for me?...like this

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
just give it a light push!

28
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
(matsumoto clenches his teeth)

29
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,870
see?

30
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,906
The fact is!...Don't move!

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
The fact is...your push would only have resulted in the wagon moving to this extent!

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But that extra distance it covered was due to my paranormal abilities!

33
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,299
That was a display of my 'wago-kinesis'!!

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,049
What the hell is 'wago-kinesis'?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well...it's a wagon, isn't it?

36
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,069
Are you even allowed to latch on a 'kinesis' to an object, and make a paranormal power out of a thing?

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Well, that was my 'wago-kinesis'!

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
But do you see why it's so hard to prove to people I have this ability?

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
see?

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Without my paranormal powers, it would only have gone that far!

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Ah! Even that postcard falling down was due to my paranormal powers!....That was my 'card-kinesis!

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
See?!

43
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,579
Look at me, dammit!

44
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,799
That just doesn't seem right to me....that bit about the 'wago-kinesis'

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,300
I mean if it was just standing still, and you moved it....

46
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,349
Ah! That's my 'card-kinesis' once again!!

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're always late!!

48
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,580
You always start freaking out and doing your thing AFTER the event!!

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You should do it BEFORE it falls down!

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Wait, wait! What? What? Whaddya mean? How am I supposed to do it?

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,500
For example, if it was originally standing here, and you were there, and you started freaking out with your 'GRROWWWL!', and THEN it moved, that would be something!

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THAT would get the audience all excited and worked up!

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
What's the big idea in pushing it first, and THEN claiming it moved because of your powers?

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
But isn't what I just did just now significant and note-worthy?

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,699
What is?

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Isn't is significant? - Isn't it?! - Isn't it?!

57
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,699
Who are you mimicing?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is it not significant that my paranormal powers are supplementing and adding to the original force you imparted on an object?

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,300
But the point is that's difficult to establish!

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
If you made it move on its own, then THAT would be different and easy to establish!

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,750
I can also do the reverse!!

62
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
What are you talking about? What's 'reverse'?

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,900
After you push it....

64
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
After you've pushed it....

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Push it, will you?

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Now, what we have here is....

67
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,099
Wait, wait! Hold on just a minute!

68
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
It's so creepy when you make those weird paranormal faces!!

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What you saw just now....

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,300
What you just saw, ladies and gentlemen, was a demonstration of 'reverse wago-kinesis'!!

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
OK, what's that about then?

72
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,299
Well, it was actually supposed to go a bit farther than that!

73
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:22,849
Do you imply you stopped it?

74
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:23,649
Indeed, I did

75
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,750
Who cares, you jackass!

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
(mimics Hamada) - 'Who cares?'
