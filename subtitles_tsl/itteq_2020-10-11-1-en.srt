1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,680
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,360
First, it's a special project
of this episode,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,360
Dewi Girls' Party.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,640
One day,
we visited Madame Dewi's home.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,320
Madame, happy 80th birthday.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,800
Wow, this is new.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,680
Madame Dewi turned 80 years old
in February 2020.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,680
We planned to film something
in Indonesia to celebrate it,

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,880
but it was cancelled
due to the pandemic.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,720
Is there anything
you'd want to do in Japan?

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,040
Go to different hot springs,

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,720
and I want to try making vases
and pottery.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,960
I've never tried it before.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,240
To celebrate her 80th birthday,

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,160
we'll let her try making pottery
as she wishes.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,920
The stage of her challenge
is Shigaraki, Shiga Prefecture,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,880
the stage of morning drama, Scarlet.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,480
Actually, it can't fit into
Mr Degawa's schedule,

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
so you and the Degawa Girls will go.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,440
Wow, that's lovely!

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
We'll have some fresh air.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,200
In The Quest tonight,

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,000
we'll present Dewi Girls' Party
and The Quest Hot Springs Club.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
Madame, happy 80th birthday!

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,360
Happy birthday.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,320
Thank you.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,880
- Degawa, you couldn't join?
- I couldn't,

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,760
and Madame said in the video
that they'd have some fresh air.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,160
But behind the scene,

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,320
she complained about
taking the girls with her.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
I see.

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,080
That's what she always says
to begin with.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,280
The Degawa Girls too.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,760
Ojo says
the other girls are unwanted.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,920
I didn't say that!

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Yes, you did!

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,680
- Their relationship is messy.
- Messy.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm really worried.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,440
And this mess will make
Shigaraki pottery.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,600
Is it okay?

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,760
Well then,
let's go to the ends of the world.

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,320
The Quest!

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,080
I'll pay 10,000 yen a day.
Will someone do it?

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,360
She's cut out to dig the soil.

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,840
It's absorbing a lot!

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey! You idiot!

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,600
Amazing!

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Just do it.

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,920
"The Quest Hot Springs Club"

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,360
Three hours from Tokyo
by bullet train and bus,

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,760
four women will try to make pottery.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Dewi Girls' Party
in Shigaraki, Shiga Prefecture.

54
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
We are here!

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,840
Shigaraki!

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,120
Looking forward.

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,080
Ladies, this is my 80th birthday,

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,080
so please make something lovely
and give it to me as a gift.

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
We'll be thinking about you...

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
- There you go again.
- and make it with love.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,320
What do you mean?

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,200
- You will see.
-It has some profound meaning.

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
"Ho ho ho ho ho"

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Darn, it's the first time I think
we need Tetchan.

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
How does it feel
to turn 80 years old?

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm going to do even a lot more.

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,040
How old would you like to get?

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
Till I turn 108 years old.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,320
It's a long way to go.

70
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,120
It's 28 years.

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,680
Follow me, girls.

72
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,960
- Yes.
- We will.

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,240
Somehow I feel
Madame will live longer than us.

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, let's go
to the pottery training camp.

75
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Potter Mr Shusaku Kanzaki
is going to help us.

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
At the workshop, Miharu Pottery,

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,080
he makes pottery
with his father and his wife.

78
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,680
He's the fourth generation
and has worked for 17 years.

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
First, they'll dig out the soil
used for pottery.

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,240
Is there any secret to the soil
in this area?

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,120
This place was under Lake Biwa
in the past.

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,160
- This is the bottom of Lake Biwa?
- Yes.

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,880
Lake Biwa was formed
about 4 million years ago,

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,680
near where Iga City, Mie Prefecture,
is today.

85
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,000
Tectonic shifting caused it
to move to the north bit by bit.

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
It's said that

87
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,440
it moved to where it is now
about 400,000 years ago.

88
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,720
Only this area has good soil.

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
It's called Kinose Soil.

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Beautiful.

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
It's said to be
a kind of first-rate soil

92
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,320
because it contains
many alkaline substances.

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,680
It reacts with the burning firewood

94
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,320
to give a scarlet colour
close to vermilion.

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,800
This is a colour
unique to Shigaraki ware,

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,560
and this is the colour
called scarlet.

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
I see.

98
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,280
It's very heavy.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,160
- It costs about 150,000 yen.
- What?

100
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,040
Whether it gives a beautiful scarlet

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,920
depends on the temperature
of the kiln and the soil's nature.

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Therefore,

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,520
everything is one of a kind
and expensive.

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,920
Wow, it's difficult.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,880
It's a tough job, huh?

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,840
Look.

107
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,000
Madame, can you dig enough
for four people?

108
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm done.

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,560
It was too fast...

110
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,480
Good.

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,960
Hotta displayed her talent
more than anyone here.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
You're scary...

113
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
"Ugh!"

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,480
What's wrong?
You have too much stress?

115
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,760
Wow, I think
I got the stress off my chest.

116
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,400
You're scary...

117
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
The soil is so good!

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,040
You're cut out to dig soil.

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,320
- Good, good. Very good.
- Good, good. Very good.

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
You're all turning into Madame Dewi.

121
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,720
- Wonderful. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
Now, for the process.

123
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,360
We'll dry the soil you've just dug
under the sun.

124
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,360
I see.

125
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,960
- For four, five days.
- Four, five?

126
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,920
- Yes.
- And then...

127
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
Oh?

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
- I've prepared sun-dried soil.
- This isn't right!

129
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
This isn't a cooking show!

130
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
What the heck was that?

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To prepare clay for making pottery,

132
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,160
first, break the sun-dried soil
into fine grains.

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
- It's quite... Excellent.
- Just like that.

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,680
Does it feel good?

135
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,120
No, it's going to give me
tendinitis.

136
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,120
Let's try sieving it now.

137
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,800
Can't we just put the whole lot in?

138
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,960
You can.

139
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,360
It's heavy!

140
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Wait! Don't flap it!

141
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,760
Will you stop that?

142
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,720
If you breathe in the soil powder
and it enters your lungs,

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
what will happen?

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,960
- She asks that?
- Is it okay?

145
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,840
People say it's not good.

146
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,240
"Ha ha ha ha"

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,920
The secret to a long life
is other people's misfortune.

148
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Add water to the sieved soil,

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,240
and step on it to turn it into clay.

150
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Hey, Maria, do it yourself.

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
Mr Kanzaki is doing it.

152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,840
Mr Kanzaki, don't spoil her.

153
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,240
Don't be deceived by her seduction.

154
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
It's looking good.

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Mr Kanzaki, you're a pro.

156
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,200
It feels like we're working
at a shop. Stop it, girl.

157
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,640
It's nice, Mr Kanzaki.

158
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,640
Kinose Soil is sandy
and there are many grains,

159
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,920
so it's blended with Ohara Soil,
which gives a scarlet colour,

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,440
and Shigaraki Soil, which is sticky,

161
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,880
to make the clay for pottery.

162
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,080
But this is somewhat heavy labour.

163
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,960
How much should we mix?

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
Till the colour is uniform.

165
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
What?

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,320
I'll pay 10,000 yen a day.
Will someone do it?

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
A day...

168
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,640
After wedging the clay
for 30 minutes...

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,360
Next, it's a process called
spiral wedging.

170
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,000
- We'll knead again?
- To get rid of air in the clay.

171
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,600
It's impossible for amateurs
to do this, so I'll do it.

172
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,920
Oh, thank you!

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,880
Spiral wedging is the first hurdle
for people who want to be potters.

174
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
Get rid of the air at the creases.

175
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
When I went to pottery school,

176
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,560
I did this process from morning
to evening for three weeks.

177
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
What?

178
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,200
When the clay is ready,

179
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,200
they'll finally use
the potter's wheel.

180
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,480
The first thing they'll do is...

181
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,880
centring.

182
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,760
By bringing the clay up and down
using wet hands,

183
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
the grains in the clay will line up,

184
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,640
and the clay will gather
in the centre of the potter's wheel.

185
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,520
Teacher, you're good at it!

186
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Thank you.

187
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,840
Use the base of your thumb,

188
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,000
press here, and bring it down.

189
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
- Wow, amazing!
- It feels so good!

190
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,600
Who is this? He suddenly appeared.

191
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,400
You suddenly appeared
and kneaded my clay. Who are you?

192
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,600
This is their teacher's father,
Mr Tsuguharu Kanzaki.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
He's a remarkable person

194
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
who is recognised
as intangible cultural asset.

195
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,720
There are only a few in Koga City.

196
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,200
Sorry, Daddy, I'm so sorry.

197
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,360
I asked who you are.

198
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,240
You suddenly kneaded my clay,
so it surprised me.

199
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,040
Now, like Mr Kanzaki says,

200
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,600
pottery reflects
the personality of the potter a lot.

201
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm good, aren't I?

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,480
You're surprisingly careful.

203
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,520
Don't say that to embarrass me.

204
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm assuming a wild character.

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,600
When they've gotten used to
the potter's wheel after centring...

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,400
- So good!
- Well done.

207
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,200
It's the basics of pottery,
making a teacup.

208
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,320
First, make a hole
on the top of the clay.

209
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
I've made a hole.

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,040
Next, put the clay between the thumb
and the middle finger,

211
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,440
and pull it out.

212
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Amazing...

213
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
It's become wider.

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,600
The key of this process

215
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
is in the skill of the hands
and concentration.

216
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
It's thinner now,
so it'll collapse, right?

217
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Yes.

218
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,360
Lastly, cut it quickly
with a thread,

219
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
and a teacup is made in no time.

220
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,120
- Amazing!
- Amazing.

221
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,080
It looks easy
when Mr Kanzaki does it,

222
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,040
but it is quite difficult.

223
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,280
The one who shows her talent
for making pottery is Tani.

224
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
- You're making it.
- Making it.

225
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,440
The gist is to keep the force
and speed stable when you pull.

226
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,600
- How did I do?
- Maria, you're good at it.

227
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
Yay! Really?

228
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,560
You're very good at it.

229
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,840
She successfully cut it
with a thread too.

230
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,000
She's so good at it!

231
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,960
- It's done.
- Amazing!

232
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
It's a bit round.

233
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,920
Didn't Mr Kanzaki do it?

234
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I did it myself.

235
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
That's it for the first day.

236
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,320
Pottery Training Camp's
hotel tonight is...

237
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,320
an expensive hotel at the lakeside,

238
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,520
Ogoto Hot Spring,
Biwako Grand Hotel Kyo-Ohmi.

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
Wow, it's huge!

240
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,400
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

241
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,320
It's actually a VIP suite
with four rooms.

242
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
It costs 48,000 yen per person
per night.

243
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Of course, it has an outdoor
hot spring overlooking Lake Biwa.

244
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
It's gorgeous.

245
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
It's absolutely stunning.

246
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,600
But only Madame can't stay here.

247
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,480
Before they came here,

248
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,320
they actually had a mizugumo match
at Ninja Village,

249
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
and Madame
fell into the water immediately.

250
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
Oh?

251
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,680
"Ha ha ha ha"

252
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Also, when they competed
to see if they can ride eFoil,

253
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,880
the most advanced activity...

254
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,400
It feels so good!

255
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
Oh, I can do it!

256
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Madame was completely defeated
by the girls.

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,120
The three winners
are treated to this.

258
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,960
This must be the first time
you'll experience this,

259
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,680
so have fun.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,400
It's Omi beef!

261
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,200
It's the first time
I'm trying Omi beef.

262
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
You eat the meat first?

263
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes.

264
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
It really melts.

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,040
Well, enjoy it to the fullest.

266
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,960
Madame, let's go.

267
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
Sure, let's go.

268
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,720
Well, enjoy your night.

269
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
Excuse me.

270
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,360
Not that way.

271
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Not this way?

272
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,720
"Madame mistakes the cupboard
for the exit"

273
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,320
And this is where Madame will stay.

274
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,800
Oh, a bungalow?

275
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,960
Something like a bungalow.

276
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Lake Biwa Maiami Land,
Maiami Hama Caravan Park.

277
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Let's have a look at the room.

278
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
Please take off your shoes.

279
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,520
No shoes allowed.

280
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
Wait a minute.

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,080
Madame, please take off your shoes.

282
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Take off your shoes.

283
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,000
What? Oh, take off my shoes.

284
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
This is the bed.

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,920
It has an air conditioner.

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,080
I'll have dinner here?

287
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,360
This one? Oh, it's this one?

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,320
- This one?
- It's this one.

289
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
A hinged door?

290
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
- It's that one.
- Oh, this one.

291
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,600
She'll cook tonight's meal
with a mess tin.

292
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,080
Firelighter? What is it made of?

293
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,480
What is it?

294
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
What? You don't know?

295
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
You don't know either.

296
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't. Firelighter? No way.

297
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Aren't you doing it too quickly?

298
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,480
Come on, it doesn't light at all.

299
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,720
Shall we call Hiroshi here?

300
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,880
It takes about 30 minutes
for the rice to cook.

301
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
And then...

302
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,560
It's time for some champagne.
I'm thirsty.

303
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,360
At least get her some champagne.

304
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
That was a nice pop.

305
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,720
She looks like a witch
drinking a living person's blood.

306
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,280
Now life has been given to me.

307
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,840
Although her stomach is empty,

308
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,800
she keeps drinking champagne.

309
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,960
Amazing.

310
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,760
It's delicious. Exquisite.

311
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,800
And Madame is drunk.

312
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,200
I am Hiroshi.

313
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,480
Before I realised it,

314
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
I've been playing with
an elastic band for two hours.

315
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
I am Hiroshi.

316
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,760
I am Hiroshi.

317
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,920
None of you laughed.
Is it not funny?

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,880
It was funny.

319
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,760
- I was laughing.
- You didn't laugh at all.

320
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,440
You're lying. Not at all.
Nobody even chuckled. How rude.

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,880
On the second day of training camp,
they'll make some art.

322
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,640
First, they'll sketch
what they want to make.

323
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,200
I love flowers, so I'll make a vase.

324
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,320
The one with the tulip is better.
The long one.

325
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,120
This one?
Okay, I'll make the big one.

326
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,400
I heard beer tastes better
from a Shigaraki ware mug.

327
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
It makes the foam very fine.

328
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
This is mine.

329
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,840
I want to make two mugs and a plate.

330
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,960
It has opened petals.
Isn't it lovely?

331
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Mine is very commonplace.

332
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
It's good.

333
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,280
Madame, you're so good at drawing.

334
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,440
It's also a vase.

335
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,760
It looks a bit like a basket.

336
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,120
But I actually wanted
a pair of parent and child frogs.

337
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,440
It's cute.

338
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,960
After deciding what to make,
they start making it.

339
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,320
Madame starts making a vase.

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,480
She presses the sides
to make it into her ideal shape.

341
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,440
- Lovely!
- This is good.

342
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,320
Let's cut it from here.

343
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,280
- Here?
- Yes.

344
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,680
- It'll look weird. Is it okay?
- It'll be fine.

345
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,960
Really?

346
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,360
"Trust no one" is the secret
to a long life.

347
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,400
- Here.
- Here?

348
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,320
Mr Kanzaki,
I'd like to make it a bit wider.

349
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,880
To make it wider,
put your hand inside,

350
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,320
then tilt your body to the side
with your fingers inside.

351
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,160
Please show me.

352
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,480
The street-smart girl can manipulate
anyone as she wishes.

353
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,160
If you tilt your body,
your hand goes with you.

354
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Then press the edge in gently
with a wooden spatula.

355
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,280
How is it, Mr Kanzaki?

356
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,560
- It's cute.
- Cute? Yay!

357
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,040
Madame, I've made it.
What do you think?

358
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
She's too busy to look.

359
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Tani displayed her talent
in using the potter's wheel,

360
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,160
and she's making a vase.

361
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Keep going.

362
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Keep it there...

363
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,120
Let's narrow it once.

364
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,400
- At one go from the outside.
- I see.

365
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,480
To stretch it upwards,
hold the clay between the hands,

366
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,960
squeeze with a bit of force,
and pull it up slowly.

367
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,560
- Isn't it nice?
- It's nice.

368
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,600
- It's just like what you sketched.
- Yes.

369
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,120
At the same time,

370
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,120
Madame is making a pot
with a method called hand-building.

371
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,480
Hand-building is done
by piling clay made into strands.

372
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,760
It is a technique
used to make big pots.

373
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Madame spent about two hours
on this.

374
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,640
Amazing!

375
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,040
It's good.

376
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,680
Just when she is about to finish...

377
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
Oh, hang on.

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
That was a close call.

379
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,000
She started the potter's wheel
by mistake.

380
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,800
But she still finished making
a nice pot.

381
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,800
The other three ladies
also made some good pottery.

382
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
The third day
of the pottery training camp.

383
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,880
Madame had some business in Tokyo
on that day,

384
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,520
so they took a day off pottery.

385
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
So only the girls will go
and film somewhere.

386
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,000
They've come
to Lake Biwa Children's Kingdom.

387
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,640
- This is what we'd like you to do.
- What?

388
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,200
What's that?

389
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,600
It's quite... What is it?

390
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,040
It's called Free Fall,

391
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,600
a slide that is 5.5 metres tall.

392
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,360
The angle is 80 degrees,

393
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
but it looks almost vertical.

394
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,640
A right angle.

395
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,040
- Oh, no.
- The first one is Tani,

396
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,440
who likes thrill rides.

397
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,840
It's scary.

398
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,800
Now, let's go. Free Fall!

399
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

400
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,440
- Go!
- This is fun!

401
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
Did she hit her head?

402
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,480
She hit her head?

403
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
- Why? Wait!
- She was floating!

404
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
She was, right?

405
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,320
- I was floating!
- You were!

406
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,880
- It was scary, right?
- It was fun!

407
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,680
It isn't fun...

408
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
Go, Akane.

409
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,200
Hang on.

410
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,760
You go.

411
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,560
I'm so scared I'm going to cry.

412
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,160
Stop it, Akane!
You're making me scared!

413
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
But I have to go. Here I come!

414
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,800
- Three, two, one. Go!
- Three, two, one. Go!

415
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Oh?

416
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,680
- Go!
- Go!

417
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,640
She hesitates now.

418
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,800
- Go!
- Go!

419
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,520
- It's scary.
- Wait.

420
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,120
And then...

421
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,240
- Amazing.
- Well done.

422
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,400
Stop it, Akane,
you're making me scared!

423
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,160
It didn't occur to me
I'd cry at Children's Kingdom.

424
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I'll wear it.

425
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Oh, I really don't want to do it.

426
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,560
There can't be reactions more
different than the previous two.

427
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,480
Stop it!

428
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,280
- Three, two, one. Go!
- Three, two, one. Go!

429
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,240
Wow, amazing.

430
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,920
Good.

431
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
As always, she did it for nothing.

432
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,640
The final day
of the pottery training camp.

433
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,440
- Let's finish the pottery off.
- Okay.

434
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,560
Today, we'll do some trimming
and make the handles.

435
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
To make the container
light and easy to carry,

436
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,920
the excess part at the bottom
is shaved off with a turning tool.

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,720
That's what it does?

438
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,520
What if you fail?

439
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,800
You'll open a hole, so be careful.

440
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,520
May I ask Mr Kanzaki
to just finish it off?

441
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,320
I agree.

442
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,720
- You're still doing it?
- Next, it's the centre.

443
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
It's likely to open a hole
in the centre.

444
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,560
That is what a pot looks like.

445
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,120
- It'll explode if it's too heavy.
- Explode?

446
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,680
- Explode to dust.
- In the kiln?

447
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,920
- In the kiln.
- I see.

448
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,120
If the bottom of a pot
is too thick or heavy,

449
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,720
it won't dry inside.

450
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,640
So when it's put in a hot kiln,

451
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
the moisture will expand,
and the pot will explode.

452
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
Now, to make the handle
of the beer mug,

453
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,320
pull the clay into a strand.

454
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,200
Wrap a wet towel around it
to mould it.

455
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,240
Also, apply mud as adhesive
to the place you want it to stick,

456
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,520
and put the handle on the mug.

457
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,920
If you don't apply a lot,
it'll fall off when you dry it.

458
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
No...

459
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,320
I don't want to give it away.

460
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,440
Four days have passed
since they made it from the soil.

461
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
Surely
she would've grown fond of it.

462
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,120
Also, by Madame's earnest request,
she made the frog decoration too.

463
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,920
It's a bit scary.

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,240
Scary...

465
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
After I made the frog,

466
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,320
it only looks like Mr Degawa to me,

467
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,720
so it's Degawa Frog.

468
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
Isn't it nice to have
a ridiculous frog?

469
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,000
"Degawa Frog"

470
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,360
The four days of training camp
are over now.

471
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Well done.

472
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,840
Thank you...

473
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,760
How was it?

474
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,120
I worked so hard to make it,
so I'll be careful when I use it.

475
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,520
Madame, I'll give you this vase
and one more...

476
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,640
I made it with my love...

477
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Love Madame.

478
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,640
I like the long one more.

479
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,920
But the real challenge begins now.

480
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,160
After they're dried for two weeks,
they're fired in an electric kiln.

481
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,320
If this isn't performed,

482
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,560
they won't be able to stand

483
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
the high temperature
of gloss firing.

484
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
One month later,

485
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,280
they're finally loaded in the kiln.

486
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,440
They're finally loaded in the kiln.

487
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,200
The pottery are put in the cave kiln
Mr Kanzaki built 15 years ago.

488
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,600
Firewood is added and burned.

489
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,560
Oh, it has been a while.

490
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,080
- How are you?
- Amazing.

491
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,880
I saw them!

492
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,280
The ones we made are awesome!

493
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,200
The colour is totally different!

494
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,600
Wait, doesn't my beer mug
look very good?

495
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,560
Wow, it's so lovely!

496
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,120
We've fired it unglazed once
to sintering,

497
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
and it has become stronger.

498
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,560
But it's still fragile,
so be careful.

499
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,720
I must handle it with care.
Just my own ones.

500
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,640
Clay is added to prevent pottery
from sticking to the kiln.

501
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,320
Let's start from Madame's.

502
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,960
- Where should I put it?
-Wherever.

503
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
The top then.

504
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
That will decide how it is fired.

505
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
Don't say something so scary.

506
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,320
The pottery are unglazed this time.

507
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,280
The colour and value are
greatly affected by their placement.

508
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I'm nervous.

509
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,760
The best place is the lowest shelf
of the front row.

510
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,880
However...

511
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,560
It's quite likely
the firewood will touch it,

512
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
so 20 per cent will break.

513
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,600
But if it's fired perfectly here,
it'll have a wonderful colour.

514
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,600
This is art created
only with soil and fire.

515
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,120
I know. Let's put one of everybody's
in the front.

516
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
Madame's precious pot is placed
at the most risky place, in front.

517
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
By the way, the large pot
to its left was made by Mr Kanzaki.

518
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,400
How about this?

519
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,360
It's good.

520
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,240
Then the kiln is closed
using bricks,

521
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,120
and the fire is lit.

522
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,520
Please fire nicely!

523
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,560
Now, for four whole days,

524
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,360
the pottery will be fired
24 hours a day.

525
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,160
Firewood needs to be added

526
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,880
every seven minutes
and ten at a time.

527
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,360
The structure of Mr Kanzaki's
cave kiln is as shown.

528
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
Firewood is added from the front,
and temperature rises every day.

529
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,080
The inside of the kiln
was 150 degrees on the first day,

530
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,760
but by the second morning,
it's risen to about 340 degrees.

531
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,200
It rose to nearly
a surprising 700 degrees at night.

532
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,120
Amazing.

533
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,600
Then, when the fourth day comes...

534
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,280
Hey, look...

535
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,440
Wow, impressive.

536
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,400
There's fire coming out the chimney.

537
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,440
It's on fire! Fire, fire, fire!

538
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,280
Madame is worried about her pot,
so she went to Shiga on a day trip.

539
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,440
- Now it's about 1,230 degrees.
- Twelve hundred?

540
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,840
Can you see the inside?

541
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,120
Amazing!

542
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,920
The temperature inside is so high
that nothing can be seen.

543
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,440
- I can't open my eyes. It's hot.
- It's hot.

544
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,880
I've been doing it for four days.

545
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,440
Thank you for the effort.

546
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,520
About three tons of firewood
were burnt in four days.

547
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
It's hot!

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,160
1,230 degrees is as hot as lava.

549
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,120
It's hot!

550
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,680
- It's hot...
- It's hot... Madame, hurry up!

551
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,560
It's hot there and hot here.

552
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
- Oh?
- Madame!

553
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,800
Now our love for it
has deepened, indeed.

554
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,360
But the day it breaks,
I'll really...

555
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,560
- snap.
- You'll be angry?

556
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,880
Late that night, the firing is done.

557
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,320
Then Mr Kanzaki seals
the opening of the kiln with clay.

558
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,480
This cools the kiln down slowly
and prevents pottery from breaking.

559
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,120
It's ancient wisdom.

560
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
One week later,

561
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
the kiln is finally unloaded.

562
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,920
I like this thrill a lot.

563
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,320
It's like a time capsule.

564
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,360
I know.

565
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
We usually do the filming
of the show for four days,

566
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,600
but this took two months,
one-and-a-half months?

567
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
But they paid us the same amount.

568
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,000
Then the door is finally opened.

569
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,560
Were their pottery fired well?

570
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
It's the time of fate.

571
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,160
Were they fired well?

572
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Now, it's the time of fate.

573
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,560
The first thing Mr Kanzaki takes out
is the pot he made.

574
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Amazing!

575
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
However...

576
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
How cruel. It's broken.

577
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,160
The colour is gorgeous,
but the pot is broken.

578
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,800
I put it at a risky place.

579
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,760
Hotta put Madame's pot at a place
as risky as Mr Kanzaki's.

580
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,040
If Madame's pot has broken,
it's totally Akane's fault.

581
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
That's really the only thing
that scares me.

582
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,880
I'll start from taking Maria's.

583
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,840
Okay.

584
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,960
Is it fired well?

585
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,480
- So lovely!
- It's so lovely!

586
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,480
A long vase that looks just like
the sketch is done.

587
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,440
So cool!

588
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
When the base for firing
is taken off,

589
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,680
the surface has a beautiful gloss,
and the vase looks quite good.

590
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,360
However...

591
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,560
I can see Madame.

592
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,520
What?

593
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,520
It's a shame the bottom has a crack.

594
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,760
Next, it's Hotta's beer mug.

595
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm so nervous.

596
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,760
I didn't expect myself
to get so nervous.

597
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,840
So, is it fired nicely?

598
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,040
Wow, amazing!

599
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,720
Thank you!

600
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,200
What?

601
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,760
Did you buy it?

602
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,920
A beer mug made by Hotta.

603
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,800
It has a beautiful shade of scarlet
unique to Shigaraki ware.

604
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,080
It's a wonderful piece.

605
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,680
Next, it's Kawakita's bowl.

606
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,560
Yours is lovely too.

607
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,560
- It's so cute!
- It's nice. Very good.

608
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,320
Kawakita's bowl
resembles flower petals.

609
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
- So cute.
- So cute.

610
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,120
It will wrap softly
around anything you put in.

611
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,280
What a gentle bowl.

612
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
- Now, I'll take out Madame's pot.
- Okay.

613
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Oh, no! I'm so nervous.

614
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,920
It was fired at quite a risky place.

615
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,480
What is the result?

616
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,880
Here.

617
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
- Here.
- Amazing!

618
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,360
It's lovely!

619
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,160
It's so lovely!

620
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,800
Like one you can buy.

621
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,080
The pot Madame made
with all her might is done.

622
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,040
Thank goodness.

623
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
The part that looks like droplets

624
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,120
is glass that formed
when ash melted.

625
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,920
The scarlet colour and gradation
are beautiful.

626
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,320
It's so beautiful!

627
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm so impressed.

628
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm touched.

629
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,120
The last thing Mr Kanzaki
takes out is...

630
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,960
Wait, what...

631
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,920
Amazing!

632
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,120
A miracle happened!

633
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,280
A pot is stuck to Degawa Frog!

634
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,680
Whose pot is it?

635
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,840
Isn't it mine?

636
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,120
It became a joint effort!

637
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,520
- This is so cute!
- Amazing!

638
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,320
Made by Hotta and Tani,
Degawa Pot Frog.

639
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,880
- Amazing.
- So cute.

640
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,440
A miraculous collaboration was done
in the over 1,200-degree kiln.

641
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,200
- Amazing!
- Why?

642
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,760
Besides these,

643
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,040
many other things were fired
to celebrate Madame's 80th birthday.

644
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,280
- Amazing.
- So cute.

645
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,440
- Happy 80th birthday.
- Happy birthday.

646
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,360
But you all made so much effort
to make them,

647
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,240
so take those you like

648
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,720
and I'll have the ones
you don't want.

649
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
How kind of you.

650
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,520
We'll give
what we want to give Madame.

651
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

652
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
I'll give this to Mr Degawa.

653
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,840
Shigaraki ware...

654
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,320
A great success!

655
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,120
- Madame, happy 80th birthday!
- Thank you.

656
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Thank you. Thank you.

657
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,960
That concludes Dewi Girls' Party,
Shigaraki Ware.

658
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,760
- Interesting.
- Wonderful!

659
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,920
Shigaraki ware is nice,

660
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,320
but the surfing we did
on the lake...

661
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,120
We did it again and again,

662
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
but you didn't show it at all.

663
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,160
What's that about, director?

664
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,840
There's the director.

665
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,240
Where? You cut all of that?

666
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,520
- The pot is more important.
- What?

667
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
Then just let us make the pots!

668
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
Yes.

669
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
Why did we have to do that?

670
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,200
It took us a whole day.

671
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,360
It took us one whole day.

672
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,280
- What do you think, Imoto?
- Well...

673
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,440
I thought pottery is only using
the potter's wheel,

674
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,920
but after watching this,

675
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,200
the whole process
of making it from soil,

676
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
I now know it's very difficult.

677
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,360
We worked so hard to make them.
Why don't you show them here today?

678
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,840
Oh, no. She's really angry.

679
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,800
You should just display it here.

680
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,320
Now, let's move on. Oshima, please.

681
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Okay. Next, it's this.

682
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
The Quest Hot Springs Club!

683
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,840
Yes!

684
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,840
One day..

685
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,920
we gathered five comediennes.

686
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,280
We came up in a hurry with the idea
of what we'd film outside last time,

687
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,160
but it was surprisingly
well-received.

688
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,120
What?

689
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,160
- Who said it?
- Who? I haven't heard.

690
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,720
- Who said it was good?
- Nobody told me.

691
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,160
This time,
please decide it yourselves too.

692
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,920
- What?
- Wrong, wrong, this is so wrong.

693
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
- You're giving up your job.
- Indeed.

694
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,400
So they will also go
on a sudden trip

695
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,600
and decide the destination
the day before they set off.

696
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,000
Iwate or Yamagata is nice.

697
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,400
Is Iwate Miyagi?

698
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,640
Iwate is Iwate.

699
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,800
I heard there's a super amazing
shrine in Yamagata.

700
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,040
It's a place called Dewa Sanzan.

701
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,760
It's totally different
from all shrines you've been to.

702
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,760
- It has spiritual energy?
- So it seems.

703
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,160
When Jungle Pocket's Mr Ota
told Crystal Noda,

704
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,440
I was listening near them.

705
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,360
You eavesdropped.

706
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,480
We went to the Nebuta Festival
the other day, right?

707
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,680
Yeah.

708
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,120
Dancing during the summer holiday
is fun, right?

709
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,920
So let's go to a place
where there's dancing,

710
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,480
and we'll hold a small festival.

711
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,920
It sounds like an amazing project.

712
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,880
Asako can't help but think about
the planning.

713
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,680
The next day.

714
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,320
We have come to...

715
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,760
Yamagata!

716
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,960
They came to Tsuruoka City,
Yamagata Prefecture.

717
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
This time,
they all wear their own outfits too.

718
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,640
This isn't New York!

719
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,200
Yoshiko is the strange one.

720
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,840
- It's summer.
- It's autumn.

721
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,760
What does it mean, "JUST DO IT"?

722
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,760
Just do it.

723
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,120
You can't tease other people.

724
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,400
Yours is the T-shirt
of the 24-Hour Television

725
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
held not long ago.

726
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,360
They tried to come up
with various things,

727
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,040
but this is the most difficult
outfit to tease.

728
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,920
The tour of places comediennes want
to go to in Yamagata starts now.

729
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,600
The tour of places comediennes want
to go to in Yamagata starts now.

730
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,040
First, it's Dewa Sanzan.

731
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,200
Dewa Sanzan.

732
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,000
It literally refers to
the three mountains

733
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,240
in north Yamagata.

734
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
It hasn't been shown in the media,

735
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,920
but the shrine
has amazing spiritual energy.

736
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,840
When we tried
and asked for permission,

737
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,800
we were told that we could film
if we go to visit formally.

738
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,800
This is the formal wear,
mountain priest style.

739
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,360
Originally, Dewa Sanzan was found
by the god that wards off plague.

740
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,520
It was 1,400 years ago.

741
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
Dewa Sanzan refers to

742
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,560
Mount Gassan, Mount Haguro,
and Mount Yudono.

743
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,240
One will be reborn after going round
the three mountains,

744
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,320
and they've been worshipped
since ancient times.

745
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,840
Priest of Mountain Haguro,
Guide Hayasaka, will take us around.

746
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,240
Please take the tour seriously
as mountain priests today

747
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,760
and be reborn at the peak.

748
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,320
Yes, thank you.

749
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,160
They'll reply "Yes, thank you"
to everything during training.

750
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,840
Let's go. Depart!

751
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,760
Yes, thank you.

752
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,000
Now, they enter Mount Haguro.

753
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,920
They enter the sacred area
through the gate.

754
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,080
Standing behind the cedar trees

755
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,040
is the National Treasure,

756
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,000
the Five-Storey Pagoda
of Mount Haguro.

757
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,480
It looks so cool.

758
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,040
The 29-metre tall tower

759
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,120
is said to have been built
by Taira no Masakado,

760
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
and no nail was used
when it was built.

761
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,000
Then they climb up an approach
of 2,446 stone steps.

762
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,360
Mount Haguro is said to have been
established to ward off diseases.

763
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,760
This is the very place
they should visit

764
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,800
during this pandemic.

765
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,360
Let's get some rest.

766
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,520
- Yes.
- Yes, thank you.

767
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Yes, thank you.

768
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,600
It was the most positive answer.

769
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,920
This is chikara mochi,
the speciality of the teahouse here.

770
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,800
The rice dumplings
are all handmade here.

771
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,600
May we have this?

772
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,080
You're receiving training, so no.

773
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,920
We prepared it
for you to have a look.

774
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,480
It's very tasty.

775
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Please don't tell us any more.

776
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,880
Staff members can try later.

777
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,040
- Thank you.
- What?

778
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,520
- There are five of them.
- Thank you.

779
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,360
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes, thank you.

780
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,920
Two hours after they set off,

781
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,360
they finally arrived at the peak.

782
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,360
They visited Sanjin Gosaiden,

783
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,160
which blesses them
with the same benefits

784
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
as going round the three mountains,

785
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
and their training is finished.

786
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,520
They let us enter
an extraordinary place.

787
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
It was great, somehow.

788
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,720
- It was absolutely amazing.
- It was, right?

789
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
My body feels lighter.

790
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,160
My pee was very concentrated.

791
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,120
If you say that,

792
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,800
I took a number two...

793
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,760
Shut up.

794
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,200
"Stimulated Oniyakko's
bowel movement"

795
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,880
It's like it had its own mind.

796
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,280
Five things that were like
comma-shaped beads

797
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,840
just dropped out.

798
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,000
Aren't they beads?

799
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,840
They looked so much like
comma-shaped beads,

800
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
I thought,
"They really are different."

801
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,840
Beads.

802
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,320
And it was five comma-shaped beads.

803
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,160
Did they have words like "faith"
and "justice" written on them?

804
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,320
It's "Satomi Hakkenden".

805
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,320
Faith, justice.

806
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,000
Now it's 2:00.
Their schedule is blank after this.

807
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,160
It's hot. It's hot and cold.

808
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,720
Maybe there's a chance
to go fishing today.

809
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,000
Last time,
when they filmed in Aomori,

810
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,400
the three ladies
caught many sea breams,

811
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,560
and they were delighted.

812
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,080
Encouraged by the success,

813
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,160
they called a fishing boat
renting service this time too.

814
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,720
Hello?

815
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
However...

816
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,960
We're expecting wind
of about 10 metres per second.

817
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,480
They can't sail a boat
because of the strong wind.

818
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,760
So they go buy some tools

819
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
and aim to catch bigfin reef squid
on the shore.

820
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,600
And then...

821
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,080
Wait a minute. Hey, wait a minute.

822
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
What's this? Hair?

823
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,200
A fishing visor.

824
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,120
I want to start from the looks.

825
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,040
Isn't it nice?

826
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,040
They went to a fishing port.

827
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,520
We planned it wrong.

828
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,920
Night fell
while we were having fun shopping.

829
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,080
Yeah.

830
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,040
So we don't need any cap,

831
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,160
and it's difficult to see
wearing sunglasses.

832
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,400
The three ladies
who caught sea breams last time

833
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,680
will catch squids.

834
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,480
Asako and Yoshiko
will just try to catch anything.

835
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,080
I want to catch some.

836
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,440
But bigfin reef squids aren't easy
enough for amateurs to catch.

837
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,480
They caught nothing.

838
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,880
But...

839
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,080
- You caught something?
- Yes.

840
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,920
Yoshiko and Asako caught something.

841
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,880
- All right.
- What's that?

842
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Some cute horse mackerels.

843
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,080
Aren't they bait
for catching big fish?

844
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,640
It's hard to react to this.

845
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,880
Why? You guys caught nothing!

846
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,840
We're very grateful though.

847
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,400
- Better than nothing.
- Better than nothing.

848
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,560
What? "Better than nothing"?

849
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,320
Will you not say "better than zero"
just once?

850
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
Glad you caught something.

851
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,160
Are you robots?

852
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
It's better than nothing.

853
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,600
What the heck?

854
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Day two of the trip in Yamagata.

855
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,600
The comediennes
absolutely love buffet.

856
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,000
This is nice.

857
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,680
The buffet is nice.

858
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
You wear glasses?

859
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,440
My eyesight isn't good.
It's in the morning, I'm sorry.

860
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,760
"Chuckles"

861
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,120
What's she eating?

862
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,440
So good.

863
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,400
Grated yam, Yamagata's stock,
and natto.

864
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
I mixed the sticky food.

865
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,840
That's right, the middle-aged woman
loves her sticky food.

866
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,160
I think
my mum was very happy this time.

867
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,960
Yesterday, she kept...

868
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
rocking her hips
and dancing in the bathroom.

869
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,800
Of course she was naked
and kept doing this.

870
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
That's gross!

871
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,400
You do that in the bathroom?

872
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,360
It's only my mum who rocks her hips.

873
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,960
They start in Tsuruoka City
on the second day of their tour.

874
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,840
The place they want to go is...

875
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,840
I want to go to the Jelly...

876
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,560
- Jellyfish Planetarium?
- That's right.

877
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,880
It is located at Tsuruoka City's
Kamo Aquarium.

878
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
Oh, they're so cute!

879
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,600
Look, there's a tiny one!

880
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
The Jellyfish Planetarium

881
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,440
is the exhibition room of jellyfish.

882
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,440
There are over 60 kinds
of jellyfish here.

883
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,360
So cute!

884
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,960
The scale of the jellyfish display
is the largest in the world.

885
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,640
And the highlight is...

886
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,560
Amazing!

887
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,680
the huge fish tank,
The Dream House of Jellies.

888
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,080
- It's huge!
- Beautiful!

889
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,120
What jellyfish are they?

890
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,400
10,000 jellyfish are floating

891
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,480
in the fish tank
with a five-metre diameter,

892
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,760
and the sight is magical.

893
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,440
The one who was the most excited
at the aquarium was...

894
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,440
I heard
it's difficult to keep jellyfish.

895
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,080
Okarina.

896
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,080
Please have a look at Okarina,
who couldn't contain her excitement.

897
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,920
It's exhibited in Japan
for the first time.

898
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,480
Are they the same species?
Their names are similar.

899
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,440
Water needs to be flowing?

900
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,120
Most jellyfish with long tentacles
eat other jellyfish.

901
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,880
They aren't poisonous.

902
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,800
Their lifespan is about a year?

903
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
What's polyp?

904
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,440
It's what they are
before they become jellyfish.

905
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,360
That's enoki mushroom!

906
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
It's a small, cute underwear.

907
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
They aren't cute halfway.

908
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,960
Which is the tasty jellyfish?

909
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,840
Do they run away when enemies come?

910
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,600
Is the water turning in circles,
or are they turning in circles?

911
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,000
If they're living,
then I can give it my all too.

912
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,160
Next, the five ladies
go to Yamagata City.

913
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,160
They've come to the famous
Yamadera Temple.

914
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,520
They climb up the stairs...

915
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,800
This place...

916
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,080
"The stillness permeating the rocks,
cicadas' trill."

917
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,240
The poem was written
on a strip of paper and buried here.

918
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,040
Wow, is that so?

919
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,280
That's right,

920
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,360
the well-known haiku
was written here.

921
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,040
It's said that Matsuo Basho
had climbed the stone steps,

922
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
and there's a hall
with a long history up ahead.

923
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Wow!

924
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,560
- Amazing!
- This place is amazing.

925
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
You can see a stunning panorama
from this place.

926
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
You can see on three sides.

927
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,680
As they've come to a wonderful place
like this, let's compose a haiku.

928
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,000
- Yoshiko goes first.
- Please read it.

929
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,280
In the large mountain,

930
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,760
I smell something like
pomander ball.

931
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,720
It's rap.

932
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,520
I made it rhyme a bit.

933
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,440
In the large mountain,

934
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,640
I smell something like
pomander ball.

935
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,720
Next, it's Okarina.

936
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,560
At Yamadera, a red dragonfly
looks down at the world beneath.

937
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,000
She wrote a proper one.

938
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,880
We started to write proper ones.

939
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,840
The mountains are laughing.
Leaf, leaf, leaf.

940
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,280
A primary school child
would get an award for it.

941
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,560
Sorry, I put in two seasonal words.

942
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,440
Is it autumn leaves?

943
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,920
When I look at my friend's hair,
I can feel autumn.

944
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,080
- Amazing!
- It's lovely!

945
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm happy you've likened me
to autumn leaves.

946
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,440
It's still early.

947
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,920
She suddenly had an inspiration.

948
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,240
I'm glad the five of us
can travel together again.

949
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,720
Lovely...

950
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,400
Oh? It doesn't stop there.

951
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Please read it out loud.

952
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,160
I'll be happy
if we continue to film here.

953
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Where did you write it?

954
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,760
Then the five of them
head towards their next destination.

955
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,960
Our cameraman has strong arms.

956
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,320
His blood vessels
look easy to pierce.

957
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,600
"Vaccination by former nurse,
Okarina"

958
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,480
You see blood vessels like that?

959
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,880
- I do.
- Even now.

960
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,560
I feel so grateful
if it's straight and not crawling.

961
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,720
What about mine?

962
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Miss Asako, yours...

963
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,440
That's how a nurse touches.

964
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,400
I might fail to draw blood
from you once.

965
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,840
You've never succeeded, right?

966
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,800
How dare you! Of course I did.
I did it every day.

967
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,440
I can do it well for everyone
when I'm on a roll. Honestly.

968
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,640
The five of them have come to...

969
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
the most secluded hot spring

970
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,080
at the back of a valley located
at an altitude of 1,300 metres.

971
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,320
It's a famous hot spring
with nearly 500 years of history,

972
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,520
Ubayu Hot Spring.

973
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,960
"Yamanba Bath."

974
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,440
The logogram is a combination
of "woman" and "old".

975
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,000
That's Asako.

976
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
Asako of the mountain.

977
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,080
"Asako of the mountain"

978
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,720
Wait a minute, it's impressive!

979
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,400
Surround by a magnificent valley
is Ubayu Hot Spring's Yamanba Bath.

980
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,520
It's irresistible!

981
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,640
It's the mountain.

982
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,120
They pour hot water on themselves
before bathing.

983
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,400
- From there...
- I'll pour it from above.

984
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,880
The cloudy water is a bit hot.

985
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,160
It's hot.

986
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,320
Be careful, you're showing your bum.

987
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,800
It's quite hot!

988
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,040
She's serious.

989
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,800
- She's scary.
- She's laughing.

990
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,720
The old mountain hag.

991
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,520
She looks happy.

992
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,360
The hot spring is a simple
acidic sulphur hot spring.

993
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,040
The soft hot water
can help to treat skin diseases.

994
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,600
They're earnest.

995
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Yoshiko does a freestyle rap.

996
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Old hag!

997
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,200
The old hag's food is tofu skin

998
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,360
Tofu skin!

999
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,840
Next to the tofu skin is an old hag!

1000
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,240
There's an old hag!

1001
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,520
Even during a sudden trip,
she can still make her joke fail.

1002
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,440
It was quite bad.

1003
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,360
Are you okay?

1004
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,640
What's wrong with your eye?

1005
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,920
It twitched during the journey
from time to time.

1006
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,400
It twitched when I'd think,
"Oh, no. What should I do?"

1007
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,320
Is it the pressure?

1008
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,800
Yes. Not my face.

1009
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,880
What did Miss Asako say?

1010
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,560
This is bad!

1011
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,240
The pressure is making
my left eye twitch.

1012
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,200
Sorry.

1013
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,760
Are you okay?

1014
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,320
Please don't mind. I'm sorry.

1015
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,600
What else did Miss Asako say?

1016
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Something is wrong with my eye.

1017
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,680
What's that about?

1018
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,360
It doesn't get any better.

1019
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,520
Lastly, as Asako planned,

1020
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,960
they'll dance
at the summer festival.

1021
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,520
They hold a woven hat
adorned with red flowers

1022
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,360
to perform the Hanagasa dance.

1023
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,640
It's so cute.

1024
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,640
"Hanagasa Dance Troupe"

1025
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,480
At the annual Hanagasa Festival
held in summer in Yamagata,

1026
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,880
over 10,000 dancers dance
to the Hanagasa Ondo in a parade,

1027
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,800
and it's a special feature here.

1028
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,200
Ms Fujima, the president
of their dance association,

1029
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,760
- will teach the ladies.
- President.

1030
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,600
Hit the knees nine times.

1031
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,080
Step out, tap. Turn it, tap.

1032
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,480
Hit the knees nine times.

1033
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,360
- And tap.
- Step out, tap.

1034
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,160
Turn, tap.

1035
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
- Step out, tap.
- It's wrong.

1036
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,600
Turn, tap.

1037
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,360
Hit the knees nine times.

1038
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,600
Hit the knees nine times.

1039
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,280
Now, they'll show us
the result of their practice.

1040
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Yoshiko, well done.

1041
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,480
The two in front are good.

1042
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,720
Choi, choi!

1043
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,000
"Yonezawa beef hamburger,
Yonezawa steak, and Bistro Hikousen"

1044
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,520
They were treated kindly
everywhere they went.

1045
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,080
Thank you, people of Yamagata.

1046
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,440
You went to Ginzan Onsen?
Isn't it fantastic?

1047
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,400
It's amazing.

1048
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,680
It's Haikara-San:
Here Comes Miss Modern.

1049
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,800
Haikara-San...

1050
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,280
She looks so fat.

1051
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,960
She's really fat.

1052
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,720
How rich is her family?

1053
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,120
How spoilt is this girl?

1054
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,440
Her parents would say she's lovely.

1055
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,880
That concludes their trip
to Yamagata.

1056
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,160
How was it, Oshima?

1057
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,320
They had a lot of fun.

1058
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,280
We've been doing scary things
in The Quest so far,

1059
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,760
so I would root for them,
but I was totally relaxed today.

1060
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
You see,
Yakko didn't call it "filming".

1061
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,520
She kept saying it was a trip.

1062
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,800
The three of you seemed to have
enjoyed yourselves a lot,

1063
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,600
but after I saw the twitching
of Yoshiko's left eye, it was...

1064
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,280
- It must've been tough.
- Yes.

1065
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,080
It twitched most often
in the bullet train journey back.

1066
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,800
It kept twitching.
