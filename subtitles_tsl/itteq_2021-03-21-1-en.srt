00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:08,160
"This show was broadcast
on the 21st of March, 2021"

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,200
Welcome to The Quest.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,960
Today's programme is
Rare Beast Hunter Imoto Japan Tour

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,320
and Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
First, Imoto,
where did you go this time?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,360
I went to Hyogo Prefecture
this time.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,440
I went to film somewhere in Kobe
that's well known to everyone,

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,280
and it was almost
my own cosplay show.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
That's what it's composed of.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
We don't want
your cosplay show at all.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,560
What?

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,880
But on the contrary,
enthusiastic fans must stay tuned.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,080
Enthusiastic.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
Yeah, enthusiastic fans.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,880
Enthusiastic fans, stay tuned.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,920
Ranger!

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,240
Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
I'll clean the Shachihoko.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm Lady Sen.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,640
A bit more... No!

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,440
All of you!

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
Are you going to film
a funny video today?

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,760
Aim to go around all 47 prefectures
in Japan,

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,720
Rare Beast Hunter Imoto Japan Tour.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
She went to the Kinki Region,

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,160
in Hyogo Prefecture, between
the Japan Sea and Seto Inland Sea.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,760
Hello! Hello, this is Imoto.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,040
I have come to Hyogo Prefecture.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,920
So where am I?

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Let's do our regular search
for Imoto.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
- The right.
- This boat.

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm here! Over here!

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,480
- I'm here!
- Not where I thought.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
The correct answer is

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,440
I was hiding behind
the boat's lifesaver ring!

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
What's that?

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
Okay, I'm now going
to catch something.

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
What do you think it is?

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,720
The boat Imoto is on charges into
the nets put on the sea's surface.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,760
The amount of this harvest from
the sea produced in Hyogo Prefecture

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
is number two in Japan.

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Here it is.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,440
Do you know what it is?
We're harvesting seaweed.

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,160
Wow, impressive!

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,480
We're washing the boat with seaweed.

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,000
There is a cutter
on top of the boat,

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,720
and it harvests the seaweed
grown on the nets.

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,120
In the past,
people harvested it by hand,

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,200
but after the kelp fishing boat
was developed,

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
the amount of production
increased by a lot.

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,360
In Kyushu,
they usually put poles in the sea

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,760
- and put the nets there.
- Okay.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,840
But the current flow here is quick,

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
so we put ropes here
and let the nets float.

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,880
It also makes the taste different,
right?

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,080
Seaweed grown on floating nets
is fleshy,

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,000
and it's resistant to moisture.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,600
When convenience stores
and supermarkets make rice balls,

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
they use seaweed grown
in sea water for moist seaweed,

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,400
and seaweed grown on poles is used
for crispy seaweed.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
Imoto tries
the freshly harvested raw seaweed.

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,320
Oh, delicious!

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
It looks a lot like wakame,

64
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,240
but the more I chew,
the more it tastes like seaweed.

65
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,520
It's very nutritious,
and it's good for beauty.

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,800
And good for hair too?

67
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,600
- Hair... I can't say anything.
- Wait.

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Don't laugh.

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,800
"Effect varies
from person to person"

71
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,040
It's delicious.

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Japan Tour in Hyogo Starts now.

73
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,920
First, we'll go to the theatre
Hyogo is famous for.

74
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,240
Here I am, everyone,

75
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,080
at the famous
Takarazuka Grand Theatre.

76
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,520
I have watched their play once
in Tokyo before.

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,440
It was fantastic!

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,240
It's so cool!

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
Founder of Hankyu Railway,
Ichizo Kobayashi,

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
founded the Takarazuka Revue.

81
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,480
It held its first performance
in 1914,

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,240
and 2021 is its 107th anniversary.

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,720
You can transform
into a Takarazuka star

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,520
at this grand theatre.

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
Imoto will play a male role,

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,920
and Mum, Assistant Producer Hirata,
will transform into a female role.

87
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,680
Imoto will go first.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Welcome to Takarazuka!

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,240
Isn't it nice? It's nice.

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,600
This is a feather costume worn by
the male in the play's finale.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
When I wear this costume
with make-up on,

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,240
it really makes me feel like
I've become a top star.

93
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,480
I even speak with a voice lower
than my usual unconsciously.

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,160
What do you think, Mr Miyagawa?

95
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,520
It looks like Patalliro.

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
It does, right?

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,520
Oh, thank you for saying that.

98
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
On the other hand, Mum...

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,840
Is it okay?

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,320
Hello.

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Hirata!

102
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,160
You look surprisingly good.

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Your facial expression is good too!

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
What are your hands doing?

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
Good!

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,200
This is a costume of a female
character in Takarazuka Hanashishu.

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
- I can't move by myself.
- That's impressive.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
How much better it'll make
the person look

109
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,720
will show how skilled
the photographer is.

110
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,520
Look up.

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
- That's the highest.
- I'll lift your head.

112
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,320
You aren't looking up. Try harder.

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,960
Make your hand a bit more feminine.

114
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,120
Make it look like you'll release
Kamehameha.

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
With little power.

116
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
Make your eyes bright.

117
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
Okay, smile!

118
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
- Lovely!
- Lovely!

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
- You look pretty.
- Pretty.

120
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
- Very pretty.
- You're so pretty.

121
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,480
Okay, please smile. So pretty.

122
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,960
That's the most amount of "pretty"
I will hear in my life.

123
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
I've never been told that
so many times before.

124
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,760
I was so happy.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,640
I guess I'm a bit too close
to this girl.

126
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,520
I was surprised
when I saw her up close.

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,400
I guess this distance is too short.

128
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Next, we'll introduce the castle
Hyogo is famous for.

129
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,440
They went to Takeda Castle
in Asago City.

130
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,040
The sea of clouds you see here
is famous,

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
and it's referred to as
the Machu Picchu of Japan.

132
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,160
This is their guide, Mr Ueyama.

133
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,640
Today's weather conditions aren't...

134
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,600
That's not true. The temperature
will rise during the day.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,240
If there's a possible difference
in temperature,

136
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,400
you'll certainly see it.

137
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,440
Your mask makes your glasses cloudy.
They look like a sea of clouds.

138
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,640
Imoto goes up the castle and tries
to see the sea of clouds, but...

139
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,000
It's here!

140
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,720
There is no trace
of any sea of clouds.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,040
It's supposed to be edited out,

142
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,160
but we wanted to use this scene
no matter what.

143
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,000
Your mask makes your glasses cloudy.
They look like a sea of clouds.

144
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,680
But there is one more castle
in Hyogo

145
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,480
that is as famous as Takeda Castle
and the sea of clouds.

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
That is...

147
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,320
Everyone,

148
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,560
this is the famous Himeji Castle.

149
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,280
I am Tokugawa Ieyasu's
granddaughter,

150
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Lady Sen.

151
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,360
Shut up!

152
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,040
Be quiet, everyone!

153
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Lady Sen is the most well-known lady
of Himeji Castle.

154
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
She is famous for her beauty,

155
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
and she wasn't like this.

156
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,440
What is your name?

157
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,240
I am Assistant Director Kudo.

158
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,400
- Assistant Director.
- I couldn't become the director.

159
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,640
Why would you say something so sad?

160
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,160
Its beauty as a wooden building
is highly praised,

161
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,800
and Himeji Castle was the first
registered World Heritage of Japan.

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,240
We'll give you a quiz
about Himeji Castle.

163
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
Question one.

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
How many storeys does
Himeji Castle's main keep have?

165
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Isn't it five?

166
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,920
Isn't it five?

167
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
Festival Guy Miyagawa,

168
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
answer the question.

169
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,000
From what I see now, it has

170
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,000
one, two, three, four, five storeys,
right?

171
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,520
Is it five? Five.

172
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
The correct answer is...

173
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,960
Seven storeys.

174
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,880
I can't tell. What?

175
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,400
There's one more
behind the stone fence,

176
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,120
and there are two triangular roofs.

177
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,560
The second one from above?

178
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,200
There are actually
two storeys inside that.

179
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I see.

180
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,520
To confuse the enemy to make them
think there are five storeys

181
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,120
if they were to attack,
it was constructed like this.

182
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,040
You'd wonder why
it wasn't a five-storey building.

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Good.

184
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,560
Deputy Division Head.

185
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
Thank you.

186
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
Please wait a minute.

187
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
The battery...

188
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Battery?

189
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
- The battery is out.
- The battery is out.

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,480
You're demoted
to Assistant Director!

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Sorry.

192
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,640
Next, a question about
the Daimyo's alternate attendance.

193
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Feudal lords in the Sengoku Period
had to spend a large sum of money

194
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,120
to go to Edo every other year.

195
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,800
The lord of some domains had to pay

196
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,160
over 100 million yen
in present value.

197
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,720
A domain wants to spend as little
as possible no matter what,

198
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,400
and usually, samurai retainers
would accompany them.

199
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,560
But it is said that some of them
hired part-time workers.

200
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,640
There was a standard for paying
the part-time workers per diem.

201
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
What was the standard?

202
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,400
Well then, Lord Degawa.

203
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
- Lord Degawa?
- Yes.

204
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,040
Let me think...

205
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Slay the people around--

206
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,600
Wrong!

207
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,200
That's incorrect.

208
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,760
The correct answer is

209
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,400
they were paid
according to their height.

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Here, 167 cm or under...

211
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,400
In Lord Degawa's case,
it's the lowest,

212
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,760
so you can only get 7,000 yen.

213
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
But the scary thing is

214
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,960
if you're 180 cm tall,

215
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
look, you can get 28,000 yen.

216
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
It's about four times that.

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,960
But why did they use the height?

218
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
It's here.

219
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Good appearance was prioritised
in this job.

220
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,440
What a horrible reason.

221
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,800
But Mr Degawa's appearance is bad.

222
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,400
At this historic castle...

223
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
Rangers, assemble!

224
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Rangers.

225
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,280
Rangers assembled.

226
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,080
A new member will join us to clean
Himeji Castle. Let me introduce.

227
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
Good morning!

228
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm Ayako Imoto,
Watanabe Entertainment's comedian!

229
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,680
Nice to meet you!

230
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,440
Ranger!

231
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,640
May I ask?

232
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,880
What did you just say?

233
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Ranger!

234
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,120
We basically answer everything
with "ranger."

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,120
That's why?

236
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
"Yes" and "no" are also "ranger."

237
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,000
"No" is "ranger" too?

238
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,680
How do I interpret it?

239
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
That's our mutual relationship.

240
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,880
Are you serious?

241
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,800
Attention!

242
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,880
In position!

243
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
- Ranger!
- Ranger!

244
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,400
She was slow.

245
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,080
The cleaning
of Himeji Castle begins.

246
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,720
Today's mission
is to weed the castle wall

247
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,400
and clean the attic.

248
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,080
Can you understand?

249
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,240
Ranger! Ran...

250
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,280
- Ranger!
- Please ask normally.

251
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,120
I won't understand
if you only say ranger.

252
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,080
They're descended by a rope
on the castle wall to weed it.

253
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,880
Safety ring checked.

254
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
Complete.

255
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,320
- Secure it.
- We'll go already?

256
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
Ranger!

257
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,240
Okay, okay, okay.

258
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,120
Imoto is useful right away.

259
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,400
After all, she had been climbing
cliffs all around the world.

260
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
No weed!

261
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,160
No weed!

262
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,320
Impressive.

263
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Weed!

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,680
- Remove it!
- Ranger!

265
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,520
Mission accomplished!

266
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,000
So cute.

267
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,800
The next place they go to is...

268
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Scary!

269
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,680
They will clean the attic
of the main keep's top floor.

270
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm at an incredible place now.

271
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,520
This is the roof of the national
treasure, Himeji Castle's main keep.

272
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm so excited.

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,840
I'll start from this area.

274
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Dirt accumulates easily
in the corners.

275
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
It's this place.

276
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
This part bothers me too.

277
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
It's the corners.
The corners bother me.

278
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,720
I'll also clean the Shachihoko.

279
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,720
I can brag about this
for the rest of my life.

280
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,280
I cleaned Himeji Castle.

281
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Impressive.

282
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,680
It was the Air Self-Defence Force
last year.

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,840
I've seen various defence forces,

284
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
but they are all different.

285
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,000
The rangers are fired up
and have a fighting spirit.

286
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,240
- We're unyielding!
- We're unyielding!

287
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,600
- We're unyielding!
- We're unyielding!

288
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,720
- And the air force?
- They were more stylish.

289
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,200
I thought it was interesting.

290
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,960
In fact, now I'm curious about
the Maritime Self-Defence Force.

291
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,720
The next place she went to

292
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,960
was the popular aquarium
Kinosaki Marine World.

293
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,560
She will verify
rumours about animals here.

294
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,720
The hearing ability of a sea lion
is incredible.

295
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,920
In a show of seals like sea lions,

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,480
the animal usually watches
the keeper's gestures and performs.

297
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,680
But the rumoured sea lion

298
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,880
can perform by only listening
to voices,

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,920
and she performs
no matter whose voice it is.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,160
She can distinguish each word

301
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,720
and link it to
the corresponding trick.

302
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,000
She has gotten even better

303
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,520
and can perform remotely.

304
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,120
It happened
in the sea lion's world too?

305
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,680
This is the rumoured sea lion, Hama,

306
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,320
an 11-year-old female.

307
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,560
She can distinguish 40 different
words in the human language.

308
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
Now, let's verify it.

309
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,640
Imoto stands by in a different room.

310
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,640
She gives Hama instructions
through a speaker.

311
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,320
Hello, everyone.

312
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
The star of this show
is on the stage here.

313
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,080
Meet female sea lion Hama.

314
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,360
A sea lion is a kind of seal.

315
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,800
She has big forelegs.

316
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,600
How will she use them?

317
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,720
First, she uses them when she swims.

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Go to the island.

319
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,160
Hama reacts correctly.

320
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,080
Let's ask her to come back.

321
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,400
Come here.

322
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,280
Mr Sasaki only gave her food
as a reward.

323
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240
To the lower tier.

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,720
She supports her body's weight
and moves with four legs.

325
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,720
Come here.

326
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,520
Whether a sea lion
is on land or in water,

327
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,960
they move skilfully either way.

328
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,160
Lie down.

329
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,160
- Go!
- So cute!

330
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,440
Good.

331
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
Goodbye.

332
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,080
Good.

333
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,480
Throw a kiss.

334
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
Impressive!

335
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,880
Hama's performance is perfect.

336
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,560
But, Mr Sasaki,

337
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,440
you're a bit angry over how
unpopular sea lions are in Japan.

338
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,960
When you ask people about
their impression of sea lions,

339
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,920
most of them will say
scary, fat, and fierce.

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,720
But when we ask them
after they've done this tour,

341
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
about 90 per cent of the people
say sea lions are cute and clever.

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,080
We want as many people as possible
to know.

343
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,520
We were told we'd become sea lions
if we sleep after eating.

344
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,080
"Become a sea lion" is a compliment.

345
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,760
- What?
- It's a compliment.

346
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,400
The next rumour she'll verify is...

347
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,600
"Otter dung smells nice."

348
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
This has to be a lie.

349
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,240
This was reported by
an American online magazine.

350
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,640
Otter dung smells nice,

351
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,760
like jasmine tea.

352
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,720
Have you drunk jasmine tea before?

353
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Jasmine tea is very fragrant.

354
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,640
It's like Asian palm civet's coffee.

355
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,280
Kopi luwak?

356
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
Use the Asian palm civet's faeces...

357
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
No! They're fed coffee cherries.
It isn't poop.

358
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,160
Nice to meet you.

359
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,520
Do you look after
the Asian palm civets?

360
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,320
- It's otters.
- I'm sorry.

361
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,480
The otters that will help us
are Momiji and Kaede.

362
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,280
Here they are.

363
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
So cute.

364
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,560
They're so cute.
They love her so much.

365
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,280
They stay so close to her feet.

366
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,920
She collects what she is here for.

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,720
It's wetter than I have imagined.

368
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,560
She uses the fresh poop
to verify it.

369
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,560
What machine is that?

370
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
I'll use it to smell?

371
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
Cover it so the smell will stay.

372
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,640
No need. This is no good!

373
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,600
I'll do it.

374
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,960
Is it jasmine tea?

375
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,360
It stinks!

376
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,200
It stinks!

377
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,440
It stinks!

378
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,640
It stinks! It stinks!

379
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,920
It does smell fishy.

380
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,920
There isn't a hint of jasmine tea.

381
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
It stinks.

382
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,000
- It stinks.
- Yes.

383
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,160
- I know that.
- You do?

384
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
- It stinks, right?
- Your job is tough.

385
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,080
Well...

386
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Next, it's an invention
created in Hyogo.

387
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,480
She came to
Kobe City College of Technology.

388
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,840
This is Robot Lab's associate,
Professor Toshihiko Shimizu.

389
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,600
This is a robot hand.

390
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,680
The invention is a device
called Gripper.

391
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,720
- Can I have a look for a second?
- Please touch it.

392
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,880
Oh, what is it?
It feels good, though.

393
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,240
It feels a bit squishy.

394
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,000
- It feels like a bead cushion.
- That's right.

395
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,800
The machine uses a vacuum pump
to hold objects.

396
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,720
The impressive thing is...

397
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,520
Even if it has an uneven shape
like this

398
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
- and it's sunken,
- I see.

399
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,880
it can hold the object tightly.

400
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,840
Even if the object's shape
is curved,

401
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,080
it can do this.

402
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,080
It can change shape
to hold the object.

403
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,000
Impressive!

404
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,680
The powder of the beads
changes shape,

405
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,080
so it can grab objects
with various shapes.

406
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,680
Factories use many kinds
of robot hands for packing, but...

407
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,680
Our robot hand
can do two functions.

408
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,080
That's what it's for!

409
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,200
Gripper is a machine
that can hold anything.

410
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,040
The new invention created
using this is...

411
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,800
the Wall Climbing Assistant Suit.

412
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
You can climb up a wall
by pressing this part.

413
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
Wait, what did you make this for?

414
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,880
At a disaster scene
where an aerial truck can't go,

415
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,560
- it can be used for rescue.
- Cool.

416
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,080
That said,

417
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,800
nobody has used this machine
to climb a high wall yet.

418
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,760
So Imoto will check its performance
this time.

419
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,600
It's like I'm doing
an experiment, right?

420
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,920
It's scary.

421
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,320
I don't have that much faith
in its suction. I'm sorry.

422
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,360
I shouldn't say that
in front of the inventor.

423
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
She'll climb up a wall

424
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,440
at a theme park that exhibits
famous places in the world,

425
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,240
Taiyo Park.

426
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,640
Swan Castle, built using Germany's
Neuschwanstein Castle as the motif.

427
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,160
This is tall.

428
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,040
She will climb up the wall

429
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
and will reach the goal if she
can go into the lower balcony.

430
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,200
It's cool, like Mission: Impossible.

431
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,800
Maybe in the future,

432
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,720
someone might want to use it
after seeing this.

433
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,720
Imoto starts climbing up
Swan Castle's wall.

434
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
It's tall!

435
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,280
She will climb up the wall

436
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,040
and will reach the goal if she
can go into the lower balcony.

437
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,880
We asked professional climbers

438
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,880
to set up safety measures
like a lifeline.

439
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,400
Imoto starts climbing up
Swan Castle's wall.

440
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,840
Gripper sticks to the wall tightly.

441
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,440
I see.

442
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,480
- I put my weight here.
- That's right.

443
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,160
This is nice.

444
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,640
It's amazing.

445
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Imoto's feet are hooked on belts
hanging down from the Gripper.

446
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,800
In other words, the suction alone
supports 50 kilogrammes.

447
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,800
But the first problem occurred
right after she started.

448
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
What?

449
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,240
All right, is it okay?

450
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,240
Okay.

451
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,240
Oh, no. I can't hear his voice.

452
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,520
The professor jots down
the problem at once.

453
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,640
Ten minutes
after she started climbing...

454
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, no. My arms.

455
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,320
It's heavy.

456
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
I thought I could climb easily?

457
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,920
I thought I could climb up
without using any force?

458
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,520
It's totally different
from what you told me.

459
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,520
On top of that...

460
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,760
It doesn't attach!

461
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,280
- What?
- That's scary.

462
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,280
- It doesn't attach!
- It's scary.

463
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,040
Will you knock it on the side
over there?

464
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,960
What?

465
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,400
Professor, I can't hear you.
The engine is too noisy.

466
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,760
I can't hear you at all.

467
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,840
I only hear the engine.

468
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,920
She struggled a lot
in the last 10 metres.

469
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, this part...

470
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,400
I can't attach it here.

471
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,400
Why doesn't it attach to the wall?

472
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,520
Why doesn't this attach?

473
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,760
The one on the right
doesn't attach at all.

474
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,040
The one on the right
doesn't attach at all.

475
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,560
What the heck is this?

476
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Why doesn't it attach, Professor?

477
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,000
This doesn't attach.

478
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,920
What? The wall is the problem?

479
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,040
It really doesn't attach.
This is no good.

480
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,360
The subject of the experiment

481
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,760
returns angrily.

482
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Professor!

483
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,280
I can give a lot of points
you need to improve.

484
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,120
First, the hair here.

485
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,640
If I shake this, it fluffs.

486
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,040
The hair sticks to this part,

487
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,480
so it isn't a vacuum anymore.

488
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,360
First, fix it so that
the hair here doesn't stick.

489
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,280
Ms Imoto.

490
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,640
"Stay calm"

491
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,240
- Yeah, first...
- Thank you.

492
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,560
If you continue, gravity will make
the beads go down.

493
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,040
It becomes empty up here,

494
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,920
so it's better to do it by hand,
but the situation doesn't allow it.

495
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Tap it by hand.

496
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,160
It's what you need
to improve the beads part.

497
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,200
Also, the sound.

498
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,800
It roared the moment I started.

499
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,120
I couldn't hear anything.

500
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,280
The structure of the castle
wasn't good either.

501
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,760
The gap is too wide.

502
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,120
It should be improved.

503
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
It's what the castle should improve.

504
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
That's the 13th prefecture,

505
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,080
Hyogo Prefecture conquered.

506
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,680
- I saw Imoto in so many costumes.
- Thank you.

507
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,280
She looked so cool
in the Takarazuka costume.

508
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,200
It suited her.

509
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,280
It really did! I thought cosplay
like this was fun,

510
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,680
but Lady Sen next...

511
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,160
the make-up didn't sit well.

512
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,640
Indeed.

513
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,960
Around the world, many YouTubers
film and upload funny videos.

514
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,160
In this project,

515
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,320
we travel and film with them to make
people around the world laugh.

516
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,000
It's called...

517
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,800
QTube.

518
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
Hello, I'm Lotti Nakaoka!

519
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,080
I've come to Lake Megami in
Tateshina Town, Nagano Prefecture.

520
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,320
- Oh?
- Oh?

521
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,920
It's somewhere cold again.

522
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Right away?

523
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,240
First, it's The World's Fool
Videos Winter Version.

524
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,480
Nakaoka, snow dive.

525
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,320
We'll film with the help of...

526
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,960
the staff of Kashiyama Industries,
who often help us film in Japan.

527
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,880
As a matter of fact,

528
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,080
its snowmaking gun has
the number one share in Japan.

529
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
The snow accumulated here
is all made by the machine.

530
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,200
Kashiyama made this?

531
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,120
That's right.

532
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,240
And you'll work with us this time?

533
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
- Yes.
- So many of you came here?

534
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
Does your company
have no work to do?

535
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,880
How can you say that?

536
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,840
Nakaoka, snow dive.

537
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,440
He'll dive into a snow mountain
that is two metres deep.

538
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,680
A cushion is made with Styrofoam
for safety,

539
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,880
and they accumulated snow on it.

540
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,680
Wow, it's cold!

541
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,120
It took five days to make.

542
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,840
Will Nakaoka be able
to jump beautifully?

543
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,840
- It's the underwear for jumping.
- One!

544
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm sorry!

545
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,920
Wait a minute.

546
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,160
My feet are very cold.

547
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,400
He warms himself up.

548
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,840
I've seen this before.

549
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,680
Mugwort is cooked beneath.

550
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,160
The steam turns it into a sauna.

551
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,240
This is also
Kashiyama Industries' kindness.

552
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,080
I feel warm in no time.

553
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,440
Not bad.

554
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,360
But look, if you look from here,
I look like a pervert.

555
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,960
But I saw on Twitter, when
the show was on air the other day,

556
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,560
someone said only you can
make them laugh.

557
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
That's nice.

558
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,440
What?

559
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
I have to do it, then.

560
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,840
Nakaoka, can he jump this time?

561
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,880
Okay! I plucked up my courage.

562
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,200
It helped him.

563
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,400
This is what I wanted to do
when I was a child.

564
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,840
Thanks for making my dream
come true!

565
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Here I go!

566
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,080
Three.

567
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,680
Two.

568
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,200
One.

569
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,280
Jump!

570
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,160
Amazing!

571
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,640
A round of applause.

572
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,720
Is he okay?

573
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,720
It's funny.

574
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,520
It's freezing cold!

575
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,320
There's more Styrofoam
than I thought!

576
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,880
Pull me up!

577
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Please!

578
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,880
It. Is. Cold!

579
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
Okay, please!

580
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,800
A girl?

581
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,880
A girl? Are you kidding me?

582
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,200
About half of it was Styrofoam.

583
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,840
It would've killed me
if it was all snow.

584
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
They thought about my safety.

585
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,200
Thank you.

586
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,680
Have some mugwort tea if you like.

587
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,120
Mugwort tea!

588
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Thank you.

589
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm going to bring Kashiyama
to film with me outside.

590
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,560
You guys, disappear.

591
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,200
Next, it's a video uploaded
by Will Smith

592
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,200
that people talked about.

593
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,680
Nakaoka imitated and filmed
half of the video.

594
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,880
I made it! I made it!

595
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,120
The other half will be...

596
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
Aloha!

597
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
The Hawaiian guy?

598
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,720
Filmed by masters around the world

599
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,960
who had appeared on QTube before.

600
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,200
What is the video like now?

601
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,120
Interesting.

602
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,200
It starts when Nakaoka
drops the ball.

603
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,560
It's Will Smith.

604
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,400
"Nakaoka,
changing table tennis ball video"

605
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,000
- Nice!
- Nice.

606
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,280
It's good.

607
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,880
Good.

608
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
So cute!

609
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,920
Impressive.

610
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,720
It's fun.

611
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,920
Hello, Nakaoka. How are you?

612
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,040
I'm waiting for you in Hawaii.

613
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,560
The last one is Nakaoka.

614
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,880
He aims to hit a plastic bottle with
a hockey stick, which he's good at.

615
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,800
Go.

616
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
Oh, no! I missed it!

617
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,240
It's hot!

618
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
It's hot!

619
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,240
Nice.

620
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,600
Thank you.

621
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
This is bad.

622
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,640
It's no good. My scalp...

623
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,360
My scalp...

624
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,280
Hot water, space, scalp.
What happens? Look it up.

625
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
What happens?

626
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,240
Next, it's the video of
a challenge under cold weather.

627
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,240
Someone will hold his leg
from behind,

628
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,920
and he'll reach out his hand.

629
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,080
There's someone
in a green tracksuit.

630
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,320
His partner this time
is assistant cameraman Omori.

631
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,760
Challenge of trust, start.

632
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,800
If he can get the full-house bonus
floating on the lake,

633
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,240
he'll get 10,000 yen.

634
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,840
Can you do it?

635
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,800
I can do either one.

636
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,440
You're very confident.

637
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,840
Nakaoka must trust Omori

638
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,360
and put all his weight on Omori.

639
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,680
Okay.

640
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,840
Okay. I can do it.
I can do it. Slowly.

641
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
It's stable.

642
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,440
- Slowly.
- Okay.

643
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,480
- Slowly, slowly.
- Okay.

644
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,400
No! No!

645
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,120
No, stop for now. Stop.

646
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Stop it first.

647
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,800
Oh, it's scary. It's so scary.

648
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,040
So scary.

649
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,000
But I might be able to do it.

650
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,800
He tries again.

651
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
"The second time"

652
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,800
His posture is stable.
Can he do it this time?

653
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,640
It depends on how you do it.

654
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,040
It depends on you.

655
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,040
Let's do our best. I'll...

656
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,680
- That's right. Go closer.
- I'll go closer.

657
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
Can you go closer?

658
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,120
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

659
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,360
- Almost there.
- Almost.

660
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,000
A bit more, a bit more...

661
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,560
They both fell in.

662
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,560
Omori. Omori.

663
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,320
Omori...

664
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,560
I can't get up! I can't get up!

665
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,160
They hurry to the bath.

666
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,360
The white briefs.

667
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,400
Is it briefs or panties?

668
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
Wasn't it panties?

669
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,520
How many times have we seen this?

670
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
Why? We nearly got it just now!

671
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,000
We could've made it, right?

672
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
Right?

673
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,920
Thanks.

674
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,600
Thanks.

675
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,440
Why is mine opened?

676
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,720
Yours is new.

677
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,240
What's this treatment?

678
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,040
Next, a video of
an amazing table tennis technique.

679
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,440
Roll it through the pipes
in the middle.

680
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,120
If the ball goes through
all the pipes and enters the cup,

681
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
it's successful.

682
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,960
First, practise
how to roll it straight.

683
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,480
Here I go.

684
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,360
They all bounced back!

685
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Nakaoka's ability to play
table tennis is hopeless.

686
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,120
To make things worse,
the pipes will overlap

687
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,840
for a mere 0.1 seconds.

688
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,960
He can only count on
a coincidence in this challenge.

689
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,280
If it misses the pipe a bit...

690
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,440
Filming becomes a long battle.

691
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,440
How long have I been doing it
since morning?

692
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,360
Five hours.

693
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,600
- Five hours.
- That's dreadful!

694
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,360
He continues to hit it
for seven hours.

695
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
That must be tough.

696
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,400
At that time...

697
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,000
Here I go.

698
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,120
Three, two, one.

699
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,560
Three, two, one.

700
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,640
It went through.

701
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Did it work?

702
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,800
So close!

703
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,760
- So close!
- So close!

704
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,720
The timing and the track
were perfect,

705
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,760
but the cup's position
was a bit off.

706
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,920
- So close.
- Yeah.

707
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,720
So close!

708
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,400
What does Nakaoka think is
the reason behind the failures?

709
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,320
What?

710
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,200
It's the crew.

711
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
These people are careless.

712
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,080
They made the sliding board,
but they didn't fix it in place.

713
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,520
The pipe rolls down
when it's unstable.

714
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,200
After I do it once,
when they put the ring back,

715
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,600
they just threw it.

716
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,080
The pipes hit each other many times.

717
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
It happened many times,
and they make the same mistake.

718
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,840
The label of the pipe
is still stuck there,

719
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,920
and they could've used transparent
adhesive tape under the cup,

720
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,640
but they used a white one
for some reason.

721
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,000
They all don't care about it.
It doesn't work.

722
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,480
Next, he'll do a kind of sport
that he hasn't done for six months.

723
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,600
Next, he'll do a kind of sport
that he hasn't done for six months.

724
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,000
- The thing you're good at.
- Good at...

725
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,840
I don't even want to see it.

726
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,280
I just don't want to dive.

727
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,600
Nakaoka does
a forward dive and catch.

728
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,280
This time, he'll use
a one-metre springboard

729
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
and catch the frisbee.

730
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,080
I see.

731
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,040
You saw my bruises last time, right?

732
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,320
It hurts.

733
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Will Nakaoka do it miraculously
in one go?

734
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
You can do it.

735
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,720
Three, two, one. Bong!

736
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,600
I remember it now.

737
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,680
It hurts a lot.

738
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
How did I do it?

739
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,520
I'm proud of myself.

740
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,200
Ow, it hurts.

741
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,840
It hurts-- Ouch!

742
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
This is awful.

743
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,720
The moment I jumped,

744
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,720
- I wanted to do that.
- It's best to catch it here.

745
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,120
It's a bit too low now.

746
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,160
Higher?

747
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,200
A bit forward.

748
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,080
He adjusts the position
of the flamingo.

749
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
Can he catch it this time?

750
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,360
I'll throw.

751
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,200
Three, two, one.

752
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,400
I didn't expect my back
to hurt so much.

753
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,040
The pain is dull.
It's so unexpected.

754
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,440
He continued to jump for two hours.

755
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,240
"Two hours later"

756
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,400
He tries it for the 26th time today.

757
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,080
How did I do it? Turn like this?

758
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,400
- I'll throw.
- Okay.

759
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
- Oh? Is he...
- Yeah.

760
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,120
Three, two, one.

761
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,320
I did it!

762
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
Nakaoka caught it successfully.

763
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
I did it!

764
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,160
It feels so good!

765
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,080
It feels so good! I did it...

766
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,120
Now that I've done it,
this is my vacation.

767
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,120
Next, it's an action video
amidst cold weather.

768
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,320
Over here.

769
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,520
The scale is large!

770
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,080
It's Human Curling.

771
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,840
You spent a lot of money on it.

772
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
The course made on the frozen lake

773
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,640
is 50 metres long in total.

774
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,040
Nakaoka will gain his momentum
by sliding down the stand.

775
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,880
He passes if he stops on the Q logo.

776
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,600
Human Curling. How will it end?

777
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,200
On the Road of Victory
you made for me,

778
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,560
I will simply go towards the goal.

779
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,880
Looking forward to it.

780
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,440
Okay, here I come!

781
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,480
You can do it.

782
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Go!

783
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,960
Go!

784
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,600
Slide!

785
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,000
Too fast.

786
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,600
It's very good. Very...

787
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,280
Amazing!

788
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,080
Amazing.

789
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,600
Beautiful.

790
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,920
Slide!

791
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,680
Nakaoka simply arrived at the goal.

792
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,040
It's very good! Very...

793
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,080
Impressive.

794
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,680
Amazing!

795
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,480
It's perfect.

796
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,160
Here he goes.

797
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
Oh, this song...

798
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,080
It's a huge loss.

799
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
You shouldn't spend money
on making QTube.

800
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,760
The amount of money you spent
doesn't reflect the laughter we get.

801
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,800
Amazing!

802
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,360
The last one is Captaincy Nakaoka.

803
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,560
The last one is Captaincy Nakaoka.

804
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,400
This time,
it's Spring High's Top Eight,

805
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,720
Tokyo City University
Shiojiri High School

806
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,680
Women's Volleyball Team
who'll work with us.

807
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,960
Captain Nakaoka makes
his appearance from behind them.

808
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,520
All of you!

809
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,760
Are you going to do it?

810
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,320
Tokyo City University Shiojiri
High School Women's Volleyball Team!

811
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,840
Are you going to film
a funny video today?

812
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,800
The task he'll do is...

813
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,440
receive two volleyballs
simultaneously.

814
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,120
It's a video uploaded by the pro
volleyball team JT Marvellous.

815
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,080
Ready, go.

816
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
"Receive 2 volleyballs
at the same time"

817
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,000
Two players serve at the same time.

818
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,360
The other player receives them
with both hands.

819
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,080
This time, they'll change when
the ball returns to the setters.

820
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,560
They'll do it as a relay

821
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,960
and aim to do it successfully
three times in a row.

822
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,560
First, the high school students
will demonstrate it.

823
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,120
Is there anyone who is
the most suitable for this job?

824
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,040
Our libero.

825
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,200
Oh, the libero.

826
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,000
The libero is great.

827
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,240
Libero Kaho will do it.

828
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,880
Wow, this is so difficult!

829
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,040
You can take your time, the speed...

830
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,320
Somehow match your speed.

831
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,360
Wow, he's giving advice.

832
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,800
Wait, it's very difficult!

833
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,360
This is very difficult.

834
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,760
It's the most difficult challenge
so far. Will he succeed?

835
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,520
Let's do it.

836
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,240
If there are
three consecutive successes,

837
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,800
the mission is accomplished.

838
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,400
The tracks and speeds
of the volleyballs are different.

839
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,720
It's extremely difficult to catch
both of them at the same time.

840
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,120
- It's hard.
- It's difficult.

841
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,080
Okay, serve!

842
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,520
It's difficult to match.

843
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,720
No matter how many times they try,
nobody is successful.

844
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,680
It's difficult!

845
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,000
We've tried about 100 times,
but we haven't succeeded even once.

846
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,000
But 30 minutes after it started...

847
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,760
"First player, Kaho Araki"

848
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,800
You did it!

849
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,520
Libero Kaho did it successfully
for the first time.

850
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,960
- Impressive!
- One!

851
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
You're number one.

852
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,160
Will number two go?

853
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,200
Our show needs the second player.

854
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,520
Nakaoka isn't confident, so he asks
someone else to go first.

855
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,800
But a chance suddenly comes.

856
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,480
Ready, go.

857
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,080
You can do it!

858
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,240
You can do it!

859
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,880
That's one of Spring High's
Top Eight teams for you.

860
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,240
They keep it going.

861
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,400
Impressive!

862
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,640
Nakaoka is fired up
and ties his hair.

863
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,080
"Last, Captain Nakaoka"

864
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,040
He's doing it.

865
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,720
Please.

866
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,920
Please. Let's give it our all.

867
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,480
I'll hit them upwards.

868
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,120
I'll hit them upwards.

869
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,880
Bring it on!

870
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,720
Bring it on!

871
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,920
Bring it on!

872
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,760
- You can do it!
- Good!

873
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,720
That's one of Spring High's
Top Eight teams for you.

874
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,880
They can even do the falling trick.

875
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
They're adorable.

876
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,320
- All of them.
- Together.

877
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,000
He started crying.

878
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,120
He's become a suspicious man
who broke into the gymnasium.

879
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,520
"Suspect, Soichi Nakaoka (43)"

880
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,360
Let's do it!

881
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,480
I'm sorry!

882
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,840
Chances keep coming.

883
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
Good! Good!

884
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,920
They have two successes again
right after they restart.

885
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,080
Okay, twice in a row.

886
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,120
Can he do it this time?

887
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,520
Okay, okay, okay.

888
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,200
Do your best.

889
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,160
Okay. Relax, relax. Let's do it!

890
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,760
Let's make it!

891
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,440
It's slow motion.

892
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,040
- Nice.
- Wonderful.

893
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,560
So close!

894
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
It hurts!

895
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,760
What's wrong?

896
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm sorry!

897
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm sorry!

898
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,560
After practising many times,
the students improved a lot.

899
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,840
Actually, the number of times
they did it is 532.

900
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,080
Impressive.

901
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,720
The number of times Nakaoka missed
after two successes is nine.

902
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,720
What do you say?

903
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,360
The director says it's enough.

904
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,480
What do you say?

905
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
You want to do it?

906
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,800
We want to do it.

907
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,720
You do?

908
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
Who wants to go home?

909
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,800
Who wants to do it?

910
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,480
Oh, we must do it.

911
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,960
"Oh, we must do it"

912
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,680
"Tokyo City University Shiojiri High
School Women's Volleyball Team"

913
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,640
Okay, let's give it our all!

914
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,840
Okay, let's do it!

915
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,760
All right!

916
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
Nice catch!

917
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
That was so close!

918
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,520
It's been four hours
since it started.

919
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,520
The time finally comes.

920
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,520
"Player one, Kaho Araki"

921
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,840
Yes! That's amazing!

922
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,960
"Player two, Sawa Enokizono"

923
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,680
You can do it! Yes!

924
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,640
Okay, go!

925
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,960
Okay, here I go.

926
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
All right.

927
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm counting on you.

928
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,480
Please, please, please.

929
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,720
Here I go!

930
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Bring it on!

931
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,160
Let's give it our all!

932
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,160
Yeah!

933
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,640
Nakaoka does a super-receive
with his foot.

934
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,600
Three people did it successfully
in a row.

935
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,840
We made it!

936
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,000
We made it!

937
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,240
We made it!

938
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,240
I can't go near, but we made it!

939
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,120
Oh, I gave you so much trouble!

940
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,480
City University!

941
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
Yeah!

942
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,280
Tokyo City University Shiojiri
High School Women's Volleyball Team,

943
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,520
thank you very much!

944
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,560
It feels so good!

945
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,440
When I was watching Nakaoka's video,

946
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,240
I thought, "How can we use this
to compete with TV dramas?"

947
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,080
Indeed.

948
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,280
How can we use this to fight against
TV dramas every time?

949
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,840
But that cameraman, though...

950
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,960
Who's that?

951
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,840
At last, he showed his underwear
and was funnier than Nakaoka.

952
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,720
Don't do that.

953
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,120
How can we fight against
Shibusawa Eiichi?

954
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,640
The one you hit the table tennis
ball through the pipes,

955
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,200
did you keep complaining?

956
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,560
There were cylinders, right?

957
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,200
They need to be in a straight line.

958
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,400
But if they hit each other
when they're put back,

959
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,640
they move a bit, right?

960
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,840
I was the one who fixed that
every time.

961
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,200
We did it for five hours.
It happened about 100 times.

962
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,720
I wondered how many times the
assistant director would hit them,

963
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,760
- but I had to do it.
- You're so noisy.

964
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,080
As the one doing it,
the misalignment was bothering me.

965
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,400
I did it 100 times, a bit of--

966
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,800
- That's enough!
- Shut up!

967
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,560
- Shut up.
- You're noisy.

968
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,000
But listen to me.

969
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,120
We understand.

970
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,040
When I did it when they
weren't perfectly aligned,

971
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,160
I missed it by one millimetre.

972
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,120
The last time?

973
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,240
If we had done it properly--

974
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,600
Yeah, that's your fault.

975
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,520
Me?

976
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,240
That's right.

977
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,600
- You should've fixed the cup.
- Yeah.

978
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,760
Do it if you had noticed.

979
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,920
"Me"?
