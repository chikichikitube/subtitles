Tonight, it's rare animal hunter
Imoto's Japan Tour,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,960

Miyuki Oshima"

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,320
Now, Imoto, where did you go
this time?

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,680
I went to Kagoshima,
the southernmost tip of Kyushu.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,200
- It was one great place.
- That's a nice place.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,600
People from Kagoshima
are interesting.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,800
People were great. I mean the food
and the view are great too,

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,000
but I'd like you to focus
on the people I met down there.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,520
- That much?
- Yes.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,960
It was loaded
with interesting characters.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
Speaking of Kagoshima, that's where
Lotti Nakaoka did the high dive.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
That's right.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,400
- That was Kagoshima!
- That was Kagoshima?

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,960
- It wasn't very Kagoshima.
- I don't recall that part.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,440
He has Sakurajima in the background
and did the dive.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
That made him into
a top-class comedian.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,240
Fantastic.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,280
Let's take a look.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,520
- The Quest!
- The Quest.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,520
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
Just to verify, you're a woman?

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,440

Rare animal hunter Imoto's
Japan Tour!

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,920
She headed to Kyushu,
which consists of several islands.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,560
- Hello, hello! Here's Imoto!
- That's Sakurajima.

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,040
- I'm currently in Kagoshima.
- That's pretty.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,240
- Now, where am I?
- Hot springs are great down there.

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,400
- The usual, find Imoto!
- There she is!

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,080
- It's that red...
- That red thing in the centre.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm here!

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,360
- I'm right here! I'm over here!
- That was good.

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,640
The correct answer is, I was part
of the Torii of Kamafuta Shrine.

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm not someone suspicious.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,120
Kamafuta Shrine is sacred to

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,720
Susanoo no Mikoto,
the god of valour.

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,680
You come here if you want to win
at something.

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,320
Many athletes and celebrities
visit this shrine.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,320
It's a super popular spiritual spot.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,120
This shrine is magnificent too,

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,960
but please take a look at this view.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
Look at that cool mountain.

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,280
It's a beautiful mountain,
known as the Satsuma Fuji.

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
- Do you want to climb it?
- I do want to climb it.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
I want to climb that!

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,360
That's a great mountain.
Of course, I want to climb that.

56
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,800
So lots of people come here?

57
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,680
Sawa of Nadeshiko Japan came here
just before the World Cup.

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,200
She then went to the World Cup
and won?

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,040
- This is one impressive place!
- That's impressive.

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,720
Its worship routine is very unique.

61
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,680
You place the lid of a pot
on your head,

62
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,680
you walk through the Torii,

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
and if you can make a wish

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,600
without dropping it,
it's said your wish will come true.

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
But why did they start worshipping
the lid of a pot?

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,640
We asked the locals.

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
- It came flying here.
- What?

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,920
- The lid came flying here.
- They're great.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200
- What?
- That's a great start.

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,200
Didn't you know?

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
I didn't know.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,520
But those two seem
like they've never heard it before.

73
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
- I've never heard it before.
- Oh, you haven't?

74
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
It happened a long time ago.

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,760
Where did it come from?

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Well... from abroad?

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
From abroad?

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,000
The truth is unknown.

79
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,880
When you come here,
you get like this.

80
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
You get pregnant?

81
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,760
Yes.

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,720
Good luck to you.

83
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,760
I'll do my best.

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
You'll do your best?

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,560
Imoto will make a wish too.

86
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Now, let's get started
with the Kagoshima tour!

87
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,320
First, let's introduce
Kagoshima's best in Japan.

88
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Everyone, what do you think it is?

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,480
- They have farmed--
- What? Eggplants?

90
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,480
No! Of course not!

91
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,520
- This is it!
- It's eel.

92
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,320
Wow! They're going at it!

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,240
It's eel!

94
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,960
40 percent of domestic eels
are from Kagoshima.

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,920
They catch so many?

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,480
Their annual production
is about 7,000 tonnes.

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
Now, this may seem random,
but here's an eel quiz!

98
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,840
Eels have a great something.

99
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,480
Degawa, please answer!

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
Yes!

101
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,240
I finally realised that I'm now
a regular on the show!

102
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
The correct answer is...

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
"Eels have a great sense of smell"

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
- Eels have a great sense of smell.
- Really?

105
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Eels have four nostrils.

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,600
To compensate for their small eyes,
eels' sense of smell is advanced.

107
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,720
Their sense of smell is just as good
as that of dogs.

108
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,000
These eels are processed into
Kabayaki at the next door factory,

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,720
and shipped out all over Japan.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
- Should I put it on for you?
- Thank you.

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
"CEO Yokota"
"Should I put it on for you?"

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,840
- Wow!
- It's freshly made?

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,840
- It looks super delicious.
- It's huge!

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,560
- You can't eat this right away.
- No!

115
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,720
It's now!
Now is the time for me to eat it!

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,840
You'll have a contest with someone,
and when you win, you can eat it.

117
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,920
No! I'll have to eat this now!

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,240
Of course,
it's an eel grabbing challenge!

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
She will go against this person!

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
Wait one second.

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Who is that coming?
Who is this? Who is this?

122
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm Donko Saigo!

123
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Satsuma clansman Takamori Saigo

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,520
was known to have been expert
at grabbing eels.

125
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,800
Mami Matsunobe here is the winner
of Sego1 Grand Prix,

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
where they determine the best
look-alike of Takamori Saigo.

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,120
She displayed great eel grabbing
techniques at the competition.

128
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,120
Just to verify, you're a woman?

129
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
- To a certain extent.
- To a certain extent?

130
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,080
"Ha ha ha ha"

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,280
The rule is to grab as many eels
as possible in a minute.

132
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,000
What I had in mind is

133
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,800
that our eyebrows are pretty much
the same, right?

134
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
Yes!

135
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
If Matsunobe loses,

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,480
she'll dress up like Imoto.

137
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,960
- I'm really confident here.
- Oh!

138
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
- I'm going to win for sure!
- Oh!

139
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,160
Ready, go!

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
- She wasn't listening at all.
- They're serious.

141
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,640
Eels are hard to grab
since they're slimy.

142
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,680
However, the rare animal hunter

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
grabbed two to start!
How magnificent!

144
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Matsunobe on the other hand,
is struggling.

145
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Come on!

146
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm going to win this!

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,240
Imoto grabbed a whole bunch here!

148
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
Three, two, one.

149
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes!

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Oh, no!

151
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,440
Now, the results.

152
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,880
It's 13 against five,
and Imoto wins!

153
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,920
Yes!

154
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
That's Imoto for you!

155
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,560
I came starved too!

156
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,480
I'll eat.

157
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,680
Imoto will have an eel bowl
for her victory.

158
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,160
That acrylic board
is about to break.

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
I feel bad for you.

160
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,120
Now, Matsunobe has a penalty.

161
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,440
Hello!

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm Matsunobe.

163
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,320
Now, can you tell where I am?

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,640
- Let's go! Find Matsunobe!
- Where is she?

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
- She's over there.
- The face?

166
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm here!

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm right here!

168
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm over here!

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,280
"Japan's number-one personage
Takamori Saigo"

170
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
That step is dangerous.

171
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm Imoto!

172
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
Cut!

173
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,600
- Wonderful.
- Thank you very much.

174
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,560
I'd say she's more like Hibiki
than Imoto.

175
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,680
Kagoshima is a treasure trove
of seafood besides eels too!

176
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,480
So let's go follow the fishermen
of Kagoshima.

177
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,120
First, it's Amami Oshima's
traditional "drive" fishing.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,520
These are the fishermen
of Ikedamaru.

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
We will all dive, and we will all
drive the fish into the net.

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,720
That person too?

181
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,120
- The boss?
- The boss too?

182
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,480
Boss, the way you wear your cap
is very youthful.

183
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,640
How long have you been doing
this fishing method?

184
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
- About 50 years.
- 50 years?

185
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,280
Boss Ikeda is 67 years old,
but is still active.

186
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,280
Let's go!

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,960
Ikedamaru does traditional fishing,

188
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,840
but there's someone
with an interesting history.

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,240
He was a host at Kabukicho.

190
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
Are you originally from here?

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Yes, I am.

192
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,200
So you went from Amami
to Kabukicho in Shinjuku?

193
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,760
I was ranked number two, maybe once.

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
That's amazing.

195
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
He's so flashy.

196
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,040
They arrived at the destination.
What exactly is this drive fishing?

197
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,800
One will search for fish.

198
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,720
Yes...

199
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,320
Above him is a person
who signals the boat.

200
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,480
So it's done visually?

201
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,360
You don't use a fish sonar.

202
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,200
Once they find a school of fish,

203
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,520
they set the net along
the direction of the current,

204
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,000
and they drive the fish in there.

205
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,200
Wow, boss!

206
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,240
He's seriously awesome!

207
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,720
Yuya, go on in!

208
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
Go on!

209
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,400
He's super cool!

210
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
Here!

211
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,960
Nets that have been divided
into sections

212
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,280
are all thrown in.

213
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,840
All the fishermen then grab the nets
with unbelievable speed,

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,920
to form them into three dimensions.

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Their teamwork is remarkable
even under water,

216
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
where communicating is difficult.

217
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,000
Their execution is too good.
It's like a construction process.

218
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
This is amazing.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The sack is made.

220
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,320
The trap of over 50 metres
is complete.

221
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,440
They drive the fish
into this sack part of the nets.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,920
What are these?

223
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,720
This is called "Surushika."

224
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
- Surushika?
- It's called that.

225
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,000
When we shake this,
then the fish get scared...

226
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,160
So you tease them and scare them?

227
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Imoto, what's the matter?

228
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
- Oh, the camera is here.
- What? What's the matter?

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,000
- I'm urinating.
- What?

230
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
I'm urinating!

231
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,600
She has no other choice.

232
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,600
I feel bad for her.

233
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,520
"Ha ha ha ha"

234
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,040
You only have one chance
with this method of fishing.

235
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,480
The fishermen are determined too!

236
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
They're fast.

237
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,760
They're all super-fast.

238
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
They proceed underwater right away.

239
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
Wait for us!

240
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,720
No one can catch up to them.

241
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,680
When Imoto finally arrived...

242
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,040
Oh, it's all done.

243
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
- They have a large catch.
- Amazing!

244
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,560
- Were you keeping up with them?
- No, I couldn't keep up.

245
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,080
- Maybe none of us saw it?
- Of course not.

246
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,640
You can't catch up with a camera.

247
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
I wondered why
they couldn't film that.

248
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,080
Why didn't he go
to the trap beforehand?

249
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,040
If he was already positioned
at the trap...

250
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Why would he try to follow them?

251
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,520
You're so right.

252
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,920
He should have been waiting
at the trap.

253
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
I wonder why?

254
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,240
Why won't The Quest crew realise
stuff like that?

255
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
Next, the most powerful fisherman.

256
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
- Hello, nice to meet you. Oh?
- Hello.

257
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
I know who you are!

258
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,800
What? You know who I am?

259
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
You are Nagano.

260
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,520
Yes, I am.

261
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,200
He's a legend that completed Sasuke,

262
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,840
Makoto Nagano.

263
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,040
He's actually a captain
of a fishing boat in Kagoshima.

264
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,800
That's awesome!

265
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,240
It's incredible.

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
Could I see your abs too?
Excuse me.

267
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,400
Thank you very much!

268
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,720
This is great!

269
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,280
What's even more incredible
is Nagano's home.

270
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,760
Wow!

271
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,120
What is this?

272
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
What?

273
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
What is this setup?

274
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,520
This is Nagano's proudest
training set.

275
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,160
I've never seen anybody with
a warped wall at their home.

276
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,400
And the ones who train with Nagano
using this training set are...

277
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,040
Hey, kids! Come out here!

278
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
Kids?

279
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,640
- Hello!
- His three kids!

280
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,360
Do you love this since you have it
at home?

281
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,520
Yes.

282
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,760
Let's start the training!

283
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280
- Amazing.
- Nagano works on strengthening,

284
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,320
using the set he built himself.

285
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,400
His athletic ability is unbelievable
for a 48-year old.

286
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,560
Kids can do this too.

287
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
- Can you take the challenge?
- Yes.

288
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,520
Let's go! It's Imoto versus
the eldest son, Kaio.

289
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,480
The one to finish
the 50-metre course faster will win.

290
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,720
Kaio will go first.

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
Start!

292
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,880
He easily cleared
the quadruple step.

293
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,880
He's light.

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
- Go on man!
- Amazing!

295
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Amazing!

296
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,880
"Jumping bar"

297
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,280
Kaio has incredible
athletic abilities.

298
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
- Amazing.
- He's so light.

299
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,800
Go!

300
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,560
He's now at the pipe slider.

301
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,680
Pipe slider!

302
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
- He got it.
- He's amazing.

303
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,640
- Hang in there.
- It slips.

304
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,360
Do it, boy!

305
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,560
Nagano is actually pretty strict
with this training.

306
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,880
- Don't fall!
- You can do it.

307
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,920
Hold on!

308
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,560
Next, he clears the cliff hanger.

309
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,480
Amazing.

310
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,200
Now, the last obstacle
is the warped wall.

311
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Will he succeed?

312
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,400
Grab on!

313
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
That was so close!

314
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,840
But he won't give up just yet.

315
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,800
- Will he succeed?
- He got it!

316
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,520
That's it!

317
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
He's reached
his physical limits here.

318
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
It's frustrating!

319
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
You've used up all your strength.

320
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,280
How do you feel right now?

321
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,560
- I'm frustrated.
- Look, he's crying.

322
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,760
"He's crying"
"I'm frustrated"

323
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,160
- Oh, no!
- He was so frustrated

324
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,440
that he cried.

325
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
It's fine.

326
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,080
If this was the actual Sasuke,
you'd be super frustrated.

327
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,200
You're right.

328
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,160
You only have one chance.

329
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,200
He's right.

330
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
Next, Imoto will go.

331
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
- Go for it!
- I will win against Kaio!

332
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,920
She cleared the quadruple steps
with no problem.

333
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,760
Imoto! Imoto!

334
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,240
She can't embarrass herself
in front of the kids.

335
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
- But then...
- One more.

336
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
- Then--
- Oh, no!

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
- Then--
- Oh, no!

338
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
- Her pelvis...
- Oh, no.

339
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
- Ouch.
- That must hurt.

340
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,200
I hit my pelvis...

341
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,480
My precious Ayako's Ayako is...

342
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,880
I think I'm going to cry
for a different reason than Kaio...

343
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm so ashamed...

344
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,640
Finally, a coverage
of their famous club activity!

345
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,960
The club is at Kagoshima Jitsugyo
High School.

346
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,560
Hello.

347
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
There's a lot of you here.

348
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,520
What does your club do?

349
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,080
Men's rhythmic gymnastics club.

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
Their comical choreography
is very popular.

351
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,000
This is so funny!

352
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,960
Their start is very original too.

353
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
They sure are.

354
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,040
Their music and moves are so comical
it makes me smile.

355
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,200
However, the inter-high national
championship was cancelled

356
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,000
due to COVID-19.

357
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,200
So this may not be
what you expected,

358
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,360
but if you would allow me
to join you

359
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,960
in releasing your frustration--
Oh, the bell...

360
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,160
I apologise.

361
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,400
We will deliver
Kagoshima Jitsugyo's

362
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,120
entertaining rhythmic gymnastics
with Imoto!

363
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,960
The students will create a routine
that includes Imoto.

364
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
What do you think of Imoto?

365
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,640
It's not easy to learn the routines.

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,160
- She's very fast.
- Oh?

367
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,120
Now, please take a look at Kagoshima
Jitsugyo High School with Imoto.

368
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,640
Live commentary will be provided
by the same personnel

369
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,560
as at the actual competition.

370
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,400
I'm Sachiyo Kirita. I'm an announcer
and a former rhythmic gymnast.

371
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,480
Commentary will be done by two-time

372
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,240
national rhythmic gymnastics
competition winner,

373
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,040
here's Kotaro Yamada.

374
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,320
Hello, thank you for having me.

375
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,960
We will now see Kagoshima Jitsugyo
High School team and Imoto.

376
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,800
They appear in Dragon Ball costumes.

377
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,200
- This is great.
- They seem nervous.

378
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,120
A woman is among the male students
with shaved heads.

379
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a mysterious sight.

380
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,880
But anything goes
for Kagoshima Jitsugyo High School.

381
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,200
They start with a head stand.

382
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,120
Yes.

383
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,920
It's Kagoshima Jitsugyo's
domino effect.

384
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,200
- They were in sync.
- They were.

385
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,600
They're off with a comical move.

386
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,520
On their back it says "Laugh."
They sure go far for a laugh.

387
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
- They sure do.
- Looking good.

388
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Here's a compulsory move
for a team performance, balance.

389
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,400
They're maintaining it well.

390
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,360
Imoto might have been a little off.

391
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,960
Oh, she left the floor,
but another member came in

392
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,200
to do the tumbling segment
of the men's rhythmic gymnastics.

393
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,840
- How you land is important here.
- Amazing.

394
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,360
He had height,
and his landing was good as well.

395
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,640
Now, Imoto is back.

396
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
It's like she was out somewhere.

397
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,520
Now, the music changes
to "Ikkyusan."

398
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,680
Now a flip in the air,
synced to Ikkyusan's melody.

399
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
That was good.

400
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,840
- The ambiance is there.
- The ambience?

401
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,480
Imoto left again.

402
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
Now, they do crossing techniques.

403
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,160
In men's rhythmic gymnastics,

404
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,960
it's important to cross over
while tumbling.

405
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,480
That went well.

406
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
Yes.

407
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,400
Let's see what Imoto will do next.

408
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,400
Let's see...

409
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,400
The seven of them are doing
up-down calisthenics.

410
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
Now, it's coming.

411
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,440
They will do a forward flip
into the final pose.

412
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
It's called Kamehame-ha.

413
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,720
Now, the final pose of this climax.

414
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,720
Let's watch.

415
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,080
Ouch!

416
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,320
I think that's a finish.

417
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
- I think it was a good finish.
- Yes.

418
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
I think it went well.

419
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,680
I can see my surroundings,
but I think you did great.

420
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,440
I was worried about the ending,
but it went well.

421
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,560
It was super painful.

422
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,360
You went all out. Thank you.

423
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I had so much fun.

424
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
Really?

425
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,480
Seventh prefecture,
Kagoshima, has been conquered!

426
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
Next up is this!

427
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Ganbareruya will challenge
a diet project.

428
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah!

429
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,520
One day...

430
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,040
I looked at your homepage profiles
the other day,

431
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,520
it said Mahiru weighed 65 kg,

432
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,640
- and Yoshiko weighed 67 kg.
- What's with her face?

433
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,320
I find it hard to believe
that you weigh 65 and 67 kg.

434
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,920
Well, I don't get that at all.

435
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,640
People tell me I'm exactly
what my official homepage says.

436
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,800
Let's weigh them right now!

437
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,840
First, we'll start with Mahiru.

438
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,600
"Her profile says 65kg"

439
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,400
She weighs 71.1kg.

440
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,920
No way!

441
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,800
When I weighed myself yesterday,
it said sixty...

442
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,720
- five or so.
- Stop lying!

443
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,440
Next is Yoshiko.

444
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,040
"Weight on her profile, 67kg"

445
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,080
She's 10 kilograms heavier
than her official weight,

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,840
she weighs 78.7kg.

447
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,960
Since they eat what they want
to eat as much as they want to eat,

448
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,640
their weight continues to rise.

449
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,920
So they will challenge to lose

450
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,920
10 kilograms of combined weight,
within a month.

451
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,120
We prepared several different
programmes for them to try.

452
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,480
The first one is pole dancing.

453
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,760
- Amazing!
- Amazing.

454
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,840
That's incredible.

455
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,200
Pole dance requires muscle strength
to support your own body,

456
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,720
and a core for balance.

457
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,800
- It makes it perfect for a diet.
- I see.

458
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,920
Pole dancing has an impression
of a sexy performance,

459
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,280
but recently, they're aiming
to make it an Olympic sport,

460
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,480
so competitions are held
all over the world.

461
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,600
Amazing.

462
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,240
We want the two of them to master
a double's move like this,

463
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
and perform at the end
of their diet.

464
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,000
Amazing.

465
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,920
It will be taught
by world champions,

466
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,080
- the pole dancing duo Manjushage.
- They're so cool.

467
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,520
Could a fat person do this?

468
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,720
We originally started it

469
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,120
- for weight loss.
- Yes.

470
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,680
- What? Is that true?
- Yes.

471
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
Then does that mean
you were like our size?

472
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Well, roughly yes...

473
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,600
Roughly.

474
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Right.

475
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,240
The first move to learn
is the basic lock position.

476
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,120
You'll sit crossing your legs.

477
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,000
Then lower your hips,

478
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,200
and your core should be

479
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,160
twisted.

480
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,160
Thighs are locking you in place,

481
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,240
so when you extend your left leg,
it will stop in place.

482
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,720
Unless you can stabilise the pole
and the body like this,

483
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,040
it's impossible to learn any skills.

484
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,000
- Let's extend your left leg.
- What's with your mid-section?

485
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,160
- You're up in the air! Good!
- Great!

486
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,160
Yoshiko cleared it with no problem.

487
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,720
- Is it easy?
- That's it!

488
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
Yes...

489
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
Mahiru on the other hand...

490
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
- How about Mahiru?
- Your thighs aren't tight enough.

491
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,600
Bring your thighs together.

492
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Could you twist your waist
towards me?

493
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,160
Mahiru's body is too stiff,
and she can't hold the pole.

494
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,840
Oh, that's too much space.

495
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,280
Let's take a break for now.

496
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I can't do this.

497
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,640
It's impossible. I can't do it.

498
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,920
It's fine. You're fine.

499
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
It's impossible.

500
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,440
Even if you say that,
we still have to do it.

501
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,880
The instructor is shocked too!

502
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,760
See?

503
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,280
Next, they will try a double's skill

504
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,200
where one climbs up the pole
on the partner's shoulders.

505
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,960
Oh? There.

506
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,360
Aw...

507
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,480
This is nothing but abuse to Mahiru.

508
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,960
Amazing! It's perfect!

509
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,960
- Just give me a second.
- It hurts.

510
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,840
- I'm sorry.
- That's not safe.

511
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm sorry.

512
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,840
Wait one second.

513
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,440
My hand hurts.

514
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,360
- Wait one second.
- What is that?

515
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,240
Stop that with your legs!

516
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
A monster has appeared.

517
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm too tired.

518
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,080
What do I do?

519
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,640
This is no joke.

520
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,880
That's so gross.

521
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,560
That monster...

522
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,680
They try several
different techniques...

523
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,960
- I did it!
- I managed!

524
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,000
They can't do anything right.

525
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,320
This is hard.

526
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
- This is hard.
- It must be hard.

527
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,040
It is hard.

528
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,680
Every time I use the pole,
I see my ugly self in the mirror.

529
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
- You have no choice.
- It's so frustrating.

530
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
- It's frustrating.
- It's like your theme song.

531
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,600
I hate this fat here!

532
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,640
Their second programme is training.

533
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
You don't touch anything.

534
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,240
They will train
with a personal trainer

535
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,280
10 minutes a day, every day.

536
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
In addition, dietary restrictions.

537
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
- That would be hard.
- Show me your fist.

538
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,720
That is how big your servings
of rice should be per meal.

539
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
- For one meal?
- Yes.

540
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
- That's so small.
- It's tiny.

541
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
They change their gluttonous life

542
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,000
to having meals
with more vegetables.

543
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,640
And finally, fasting.

544
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
We are planning on three days
and four nights.

545
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,200
Wow!

546
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,600
So we won't eat anything
for three days four nights?

547
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,600
Yes.

548
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,360
Recently, fasting facilities
have become popular

549
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
as a place where they can diet,

550
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,600
as well as give a break
to the stomach and intestines,

551
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,600
to detox the body and the mind.

552
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
And the place where they will
discipline the body and the mind

553
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,320
while fasting is...

554
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
Chisoku-an in Kure, Hiroshima.

555
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,880
It's in the middle of the mountains
with barely any cell reception.

556
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,000
They offer fasting as part
of Buddhist training.

557
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

558
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Hello.

559
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,600
This is Koho Yuhara,
the Buddhist priest.

560
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Unlike the other facilities,
we don't just fast here.

561
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
There's more than fasting?

562
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,520
We walk the mountains
and meditate under the waterfall.

563
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,920
I want you to think about your
future life before you go home.

564
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,960
I do have parts of me
that I want to change.

565
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,880
I compare myself to others.

566
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,160
That's the worst thing you can do.

567
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,360
I compare myself to NiziU.

568
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,000
I want to be like NiziU.

569
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,120
- It's impossible.
- I just want to be NiziU.

570
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,560
That is not good at all.

571
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,200
That's the worst thing you can do.

572
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,120
Right.

573
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
Are we the only ones
doing the fasting?

574
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,720
You know how the crew should unite?

575
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,400
So now the staff will participate
in the fast as well.

576
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,920
Let's do this!

577
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,160
Hip hip V!

578
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,160
Do it!

579
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,480
First, they'll weigh themselves
before fasting.

580
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,360
AD Uchiyama
and Director Maekawa's weight

581
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
are as noted.

582
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,000
And Ganbareruya, who's been
on a diet programme for two weeks.

583
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,600
First, it's Mahiru.

584
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,000
It's less?

585
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,240
She's lost three kilograms.

586
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,360
That's amazing.

587
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
You're so modest.

588
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,240
Next is Yoshiko.

589
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,680
Oh!

590
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,280
"Before the diet, 78.7kg"

591
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,080
- She lost five kilograms.
- They're almost at their goal!

592
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,200
Yes!

593
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,360
No way! I've lost a lot!

594
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,200
The two of them have successfully
lost eight kilograms already!

595
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
What do we do? If we fast now, we'll
lose about three to four kilograms.

596
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,800
Will they be able to reach their
goal of 10 kilograms by fasting?

597
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,600
Today is your first day,

598
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,360
so we'll have you start making
your juice for dinner.

599
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,760
We can eat today?

600
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,200
- It's juice.
- Oh, juice?

601
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,080
It's fasting, but to supplement
the minimum amount of energy,

602
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,800
they're allowed to drink
carrot juice three times a day.

603
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,920
We shall gratefully eat.

604
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,960
Whether one likes it or not,

605
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
you will only get one glass
of carrot juice per meal.

606
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,680
How is it?

607
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,800
It's delicious.

608
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
I don't know if I can endure this.

609
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,640
It's fine.

610
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
- Her personality has changed.
- Let's do our best.

611
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,560
- Mahiru, you've changed already.
- Amazing.

612
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,560
She's easily influenced.

613
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,360
Their first day is now over.

614
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
- Okay.
- Nine o'clock?

615
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,160
Second day of fasting.

616
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,040
They wake up at five in the morning.

617
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,400
- That's early.
- Five in the morning?

618
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,760
Komyo Shingon.

619
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,320
They chant Buddhist sutras
at the main temple.

620
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,960
"Chant Buddhist sutras"

621
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
And immediately,

622
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,360
they go on a mountain walking
training called "Kaihogyo."

623
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,440
They don't give them time to think.

624
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
This is Tatsu, their guide.

625
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
This is your first day,
so I'll walk slowly,

626
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,360
but it's not a morning stroll.

627
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,840
It's a training called Kaihogyo.

628
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,000
Yes.

629
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,240
It's not a morning stroll.

630
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,960
It's not a morning stroll.

631
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,600
- They're headed for Kobo-ji Temple,
- Aren't they going fast?

632
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,800
- close to the summit of Mt. Noro.
- He's moving fast.

633
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm hungry.

634
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,440
It's an hour walk. It's a long way
to walk on an empty stomach.

635
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
There's a great shooting spot.

636
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,520
Over there...

637
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,800
we'll go in from that area
next to the bathrooms.

638
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,800
You can go on the opposite bank.
How about you get a shot

639
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,920
from that side too?

640
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,200
Taki is very familiar
with TV coverage.

641
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,280
Once I see the videographer,

642
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
- I'll start walking.
- I see.

643
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,680
He's considering
the camera angle as well.

644
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
They walked for an hour...

645
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,720
- Looking great!
- That's beautiful.

646
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,920
They arrive at their destination,
Kobo-ji Temple.

647
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,760
This place is where Kobo Daishi
Kukai came twice to train.

648
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
This is beautiful.

649
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,640
The view is magnificent.

650
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,040
We are above the clouds.

651
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,280
What's seen from the vista point
at elevation of 800 metres

652
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,880
is the beautiful Seto Inland Sea.

653
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,440
They can even see Mt Ishizuchi,
far away in Shikoku.

654
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,640
Consider how it would look
before you sit down.

655
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,360
Consider how it looks
before you sit down...

656
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,200
Please take a look at this scene,
with Taki's approval!

657
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,480
After they meditate here
for 30 minutes...

658
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,520
they walk again for an hour
to head back to the hall.

659
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,920
It's hard on empty stomach.

660
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
Someone is grilling fish.

661
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,480
I know. Someone
is grilling fish somewhere.

662
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,880
They smell it.

663
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,040
- I smell someone grilling fish.
- Their sense of smell is better.

664
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,960
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

665
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,000
We just came back.

666
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,280
Are you perhaps grilling fish?

667
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,240
Yes, I'm grilling it.

668
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
"Ha ha ha ha"

669
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,360
Oh, that must be nice.

670
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,840
However, trainees can only have
carrot juice.

671
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,320
Right, they're fasting right now.

672
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,680
During their training,
they can't have any solid food.

673
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,600
When I was climbing the mountains,

674
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,440
I was more exhausted than anything,
so I only thought about that.

675
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,320
Now that I'm back here, only thing
I can think now is that I'm hungry.

676
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
That's natural.

677
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,240
In that case, we'll introduce
Hiroshima's highlights

678
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
during their free time to keep
their mind off their hunger.

679
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
- We are here at Tomo no Ura!
- Who are they?

680
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,560
- What is that?
- What are they?

681
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,360
Tomo no Ura in Hiroshima
is said to be the place

682
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,160
where Director Hayao Miyazaki
spent time

683
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,520
to get his idea
for the movie "Ponyo."

684
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,880
It's amazing.

685
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,400
What a beautiful view.

686
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,760
It's exactly like Sosuke
and his mother, Lisa's town.

687
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,120
It's exactly like the animation.

688
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,480
- Is that so?
- Oh?

689
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,800
So you must be Ponyo, right?

690
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
You're Ponyo, right? I get that.

691
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,440
Who am I?

692
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,160
- Sosuke.
- Sosuke?

693
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,800
"Ponyo like Sosuke!" she says,
and hugs him like this.

694
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
What these two will try is...

695
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,520
- Ghibli plank.
- What?

696
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,520
It's a challenge where they
recite a whole scene

697
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,440
from a Ghibli movie
while doing a plank.

698
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,720
- You mean from Ponyo?
- What's with that face?

699
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,840
The only Ghibli movie I've seen
is Spirited Away.

700
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,960
Could you change it
to Spirited Away?

701
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,640
We have No-Face too.

702
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,800
So the title for this challenge
is "Spirited Away" now.

703
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,720
If they fail, they will be victims
to a bunch of mouse traps.

704
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,560
Now, let the Ghibli plank start.

705
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,960
This bath is reserved
for out filthiest guests.

706
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,800
It's caked with sludge.

707
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,240
This tub needs an herbal soak.

708
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,840
Sen, go get a tag from the foreman.

709
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
I can't waste that on you.

710
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,040
Good morning.

711
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,760
Feeling refreshed?

712
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,280
Certainly! A luxurious sulphur soak!

713
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,280
No point in standing there.
Scrub with your hands.

714
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,400
But it has to be an herbal soak.

715
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,120
You sure are dense.

716
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,560
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up.

717
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Relax and enjoy.

718
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,800
Oh, no!

719
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,640
"No-Face bows to Chihiro"

720
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,080
Hello, foreman here.

721
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,360
Yes...

722
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,160
Thank you so much!

723
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,680
Go ahead and let go.

724
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,240
I'll get our breakfast!

725
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,040
Okay!

726
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,800
Well... The bath is not ready yet.

727
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,720
Ouch! Ouch!

728
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,280
Yoshiko couldn't hold it.
She failed.

729
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,120
I can't do it with that!

730
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,560
My bad.

731
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm sorry.

732
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,360
I can't do it with this crew.

733
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
So they learned that from Ghibli,

734
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,920
and No Face made an appearance.
We heard the mouse traps go off,

735
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,320
and we heard the videographer fart.

736
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,240
What was with that footage?

737
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,440
That was a mysterious three minutes.

738
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,520
That was a mystery. It was the most
mysterious three minutes.

739
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,200
I'll watch it again Sunday night,

740
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,560
with No Face.

741
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,320
- The mysterious three minutes?
- Yes, the mysterious three minutes.

742
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,800
- It was a mystery, right?
- I'll watch it again.

743
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,560
I'll reflect on it again
when I watch it Sunday night.

744
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,720
Third day of fasting.

745
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,320
They will have miso soup
with no solid food.

746
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,160
- That much?
- It must be tasty though.

747
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,800
Headaches and muscle cramps
are common

748
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,040
during fasting
due to a lack of sodium,

749
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,160
so they supplement salt intake with
miso soup with no solid ingredients.

750
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,080
"Sodium"

751
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
It's delicious.

752
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,880
This miso soup...

753
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,160
is the best I've ever had.

754
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,480
After their breakfast, they head
to the highlight of fasting,

755
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
the waterfall meditation.

756
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
Waterfall meditation...

757
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,160
- Namu Fudo Myo-o!
- She's pretty loud.

758
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,280
- Namu Fudo Myo-o!
- It's not hitting her at all.

759
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,200
- It's not hitting Mahiru at all.
- Namu Fudo Myo-o!

760
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,960
- It's hitting Taki only.
- Namu Fudo Myo-o!

761
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,840
All the water is hitting Taki.

762
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,160
- Namu Fudo Myo-o!
- It's not hitting her at all.

763
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,440
Yoshiko is at her limits
with hunger.

764
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,920
Takoyaki! Okonomiyaki!
Beef fillet steak!

765
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,080
- Gizzards, gizzards, gizzards!
- Gizzards?

766
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,800
- Gizzards.
- She wants it that badly.

767
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,560
- But an incident happens...
- What happened?

768
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,960
Today is your third day,

769
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,280
so I will have you recite
"Unbeaten by the rain."

770
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,920
This is an assignment that's given
to all participants of this fast.

771
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,600
Please learn it.

772
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
I already know this.

773
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,000
Why?

774
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,720
I learned it
when I was in primary school.

775
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,960
You still remember it?

776
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,880
Yes.

777
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,640
Will one of you go ahead and recite?

778
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,680
Yes.

779
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,600
Unbeaten by the rain.

780
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,320
Unbeaten by the wind.

781
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,560
Unbowed by the snow
and the summer heat.

782
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,600
Strong in body.

783
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,120
Free from greed.

784
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,480
Without any anger.

785
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,960
Always serene.

786
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,160
Mahiru does it perfectly.

787
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,200
Such a person I want to be.

788
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,160
That was 100 percent.

789
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,680
- Thank you very much.
- That's wonderful.

790
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,640
Amazing.

791
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
- Next.
- There she is.

792
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,560
- Is she okay?
- Actually, Yoshiko...

793
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,120
she completely forgot
about this recitation.

794
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,800
Whatever happens, consider yourself
last, always put others first.

795
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,760
She's telling her.

796
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,360
Understand from your observation
and experience.

797
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,160
- Never lose sight of these things.
- Never lose sight of these things.

798
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,320
"The proprietress of
a Japanese style restaurant"

799
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,840
Completely like the proprietress
of a Japanese style restaurant.

800
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,360
The Buddhist priest is listening
to her with his eyes closed,

801
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,200
so he doesn't notice.

802
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Being neither praised...

803
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,760
- nor a burden.
- nor a burden.

804
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Such a person I want to be.

805
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,920
All right.

806
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,560
Good job!

807
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,840
It was 99 percent, though.

808
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,200
- But the content
- Thank you very much.

809
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,200
was 100 percent.

810
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,360
- That was great.
- He knows it.

811
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,040
- There aren't that many people
- Then...

812
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,480
- that could get 100 percent.
- Oh?

813
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,520
No way.

814
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
What? Is she crying?

815
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
That's not their theme song!

816
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,320
Don't be rude.

817
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,800
You should reflect
on your own actions.

818
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,280
- Mahiru was telling me.
- Reflect on your own actions.

819
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,200
I thought that Buddhist priest
will be upset with me.

820
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,120
When I looked up, he said
"That was great!"

821
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,720
He didn't realise that Mahiru
was whispering the prose to me.

822
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
So I felt really...

823
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,320
guilty and I didn't know what to do.

824
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,280
That's why I was crying.

825
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,640
What's the matter?

826
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Turn around.

827
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,720
That's how you get rid of spirits.

828
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,640
"The Buddhist priest thought she
was possessed by something"

829
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,240
- I'm sorry.
- You're crying again?

830
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
I'm sorry.

831
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,200
So...

832
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,600
What's the matter?

833
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
It's nothing.

834
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,400
I thought about telling him
several times.

835
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,720
Why didn't you?

836
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,520
The fact that you had conflicted
feelings means something.

837
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,480
Will I be able to change?

838
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,200
Yes, you can change.

839
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,880
Will I be punished?

840
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
You will be punished.

841
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Then their final day came.

842
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm sorry. I have something I need
to apologise to you about.

843
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,320
- What is it?
- Oh, you're going to tell him?

844
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
Yesterday...

845
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,320
I didn't...

846
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,040
remember to...

847
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,000
learn "Unbeaten by Rain."

848
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,080
You remembered it.

849
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,920
I cheated.

850
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,160
Then do you want to try it now?

851
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,960
Yes, I learned it.

852
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,920
Okay.

853
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
- Really?
- That's good.

854
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,760
Unbeaten by rain.
Unbeaten by wind.

855
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,080
Unbowed by the snow
and the summer heat.

856
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,760
Strong in body.

857
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,200
Free from greed.
Without any anger.

858
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,240
Always serene.

859
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,760
With a handful of brown rice a day,

860
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,920
we have Miso and a small amount
of vegetables.

861
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,320
Whatever happens, consider yourself
last, always put others first.

862
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,160
Understand from your
observation and experience.

863
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,280
Never lose sight of these things.

864
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,720
In the shadows
of the pine groves in the fields,

865
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,120
live modestly under a thatched roof.

866
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,960
In the East,
if there is a sick child,

867
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
go there and take care of them.

868
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,040
In the West,
if there is an exhausted mother,

869
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,120
go there and relieve her
of her burden.

870
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,520
In the South,
if there is a man near death,

871
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,760
go there and comfort him,
and tell him, "Be not afraid."

872
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,440
In the North, if there are
arguments and legal disputes,

873
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
go there and persuade them
it's not worth it.

874
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,480
In a drought, shed tears.

875
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,720
In a cold summer, carry on.

876
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,600
Let them call me a fool.

877
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,480
Being neither praised nor a burden,

878
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,960
such a person I want to be.

879
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,840
Good job.

880
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,320
Please hold on
to your upstanding heart.

881
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,360
- Yes.
- Good for you.

882
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,920
Now, the final weigh-in!

883
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,360
How many kilograms
did the four of them lose,

884
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,000
as a result of three days
and four nights of fasting?

885
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
First, AD Uchiyama.

886
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,720
"AD Uchiyama,
Before fasting, 66.6kg"

887
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,360
64.0kg.

888
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,320
Good job!

889
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Uchiyama lost 2.6 kilograms.

890
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,200
Next is the director Maekawa.

891
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,160
How did she do?

892
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,280
63.5kg.

893
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
"Director Maekawa
Before fasting, 64.5kg"

894
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,720
One kilogram.

895
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,800
Were you eating something?

896
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,160
Next up is Mahiru.

897
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,640
"Before fasting, 68.2 kilograms"

898
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,440
66.7kg.

899
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,320
That means you lost 1.5kg.

900
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Amazing.

901
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,760
I was told you lose
about a kilogram a day.

902
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,360
I feel like I'm more bloated
than before I started.

903
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,320
You're right. I don't have
the urge to go to the bathroom,

904
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,560
and I feel all the water I took in
is accumulated in the body.

905
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,280
We're all girls here.

906
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,560
Finally, it's Yoshiko, the only one
over the weight of 70kg...

907
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,240
"Before fasting, 73.6 kilograms"

908
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,680
You lost 1.3 kilograms.

909
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,160
Being the fattest one here...

910
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,520
Honestly I thought I'd lose
the most out of all of us.

911
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,720
- It was so hard too...
- That's true.

912
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,840
Maybe your body didn't change,

913
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
- but your heart changed, right?
- What is up with her?

914
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,720
It's not "Fasting had no meaning."

915
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
Through fasting,

916
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
- you've realised many things.
- Is she okay?

917
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,200
I'm sorry. You smell like a person
who hasn't had anything to eat.

918
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,840
That's a realisation too.

919
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,000
Fasting...

920
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,600
makes your breath smell bad.

921
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,000
Nevertheless, they still
went over their initial goal,

922
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,600
and was successful in losing 10.8kg.

923
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,560
Amazing!

924
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,640
They continued to do their best
for two more weeks.

925
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,080
Their one month challenge was over!

926
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,920
How much did Ganbareruya change
over a month?

927
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,880
Time to unveil!

928
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,440
What? That's amazing.

929
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,840
- They've lost lot more weight,
- I'm impressed.

930
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,200
- two weeks after the fasting.
- Mahiru is pretty.

931
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,200
Her makeup...

932
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,000
Yoshiko could pass for a Miss Japan
with the way she stands.

933
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,800
What's with them?

934
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,080
Before their final weigh-in...

935
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
What's with their swimsuit?

936
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,760
Please take a look at their
pole dance performance,

937
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,040
after a month of training.

938
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,040
There they are!

939
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,440
"Roppongi Hills Sky Deck"

940
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,760
- What a beautiful night view.
- It said "Roppongi Hills."

941
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,360
That's a great place.

942
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,600
First, a spinning technique
to show their teamwork.

943
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,080
That's pretty!

944
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
Amazing.

945
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,920
- Amazing.
- Incredible.

946
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,600
- That's great.
- And...

947
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,720
Mahiru wraps her arms around
Yoshiko and rotates.

948
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,000
Amazing!

949
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Wonderful!

950
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,840
Before they went on a diet,
their body was too heavy to lift,

951
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,040
but now they're able to control it
using their own muscles.

952
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,960
And what's great is that the monster
is nowhere to be seen.

953
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,120
Amazing.

954
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,160
That's so graceful.

955
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,240
That's amazing.

956
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,200
This is amazing.

957
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,720
- Amazing.
- From here,

958
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,880
they will do a spinning trick
together on a pole.

959
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,520
This is pretty.

960
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,160
That's amazing.

961
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,280
That's incredible.

962
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,360
Amazing.

963
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,160
Then the finale...

964
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,240
Yoshiko will do a Y-balance
on Mahiru's thighs.

965
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,640
That's amazing.

966
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Incredible.

967
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,800
That's incredible.

968
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,200
- That was amazing.
- That's incredible.

969
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,360
The last technique will test
their trust.

970
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,960
Smile. Keep smiling.

971
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,000
- Smile.
- Looking good.

972
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,160
What? You did this one?

973
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,840
Amazing!

974
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,800
It's amazing!

975
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,440
What a great smile.

976
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Amazing.

977
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,080
Now, time for that fateful weigh-in.

978
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,080
Let's do this...

979
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,000
- First, Mahiru will be weighed.
- She definitely lost some weight.

980
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,480
- Before, she weighed 71.1kg.
- She looks completely different.

981
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,240
How much does she weigh?

982
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,480
I lost weight!

983
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,720
I lost a lot of weight!

984
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,120
- Amazing.
- Mahiru

985
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,480
- lost 6.8kg in a month.
- That's incredible.

986
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,720
Is this really me?

987
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,480
I've never been 64kg before.

988
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,760
You weigh less than your official
weight listed on your profile.

989
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,680
You're right.

990
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,840
Next up is Yoshiko.

991
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,720
She weighed 78.7kg before her diet.

992
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,520
"Before her diet, 78.7kg"

993
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,880
Wow!

994
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,280
Amazing!

995
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,240
Yoshiko lost 10.8kg all by herself!

996
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,240
Amazing.

997
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,040
From the side,
the difference is clear.

998
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,240
She lost a lot!

999
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,040
Amazingly, they lost way over
their original goal,

1000
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,920
and lost a total of 17.6kg.

1001
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,080
They lost a lot of weight.

1002
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,000
If you want to be the person
you want to be,

1003
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,360
then what's important is

1004
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,560
not to compare yourself to others,

1005
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,120
- but to face yourself.
- Be quiet!

1006
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,160
I realised that.

1007
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,680
That's it for
Ganbareruya's diet project.

1008
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Amazing.

1009
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,840
- Amazing.
- You haven't gained any back?

1010
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,040
- Right?
- You haven't gained it back?

1011
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,400
Well...

1012
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,320
I guess I got back about two,
three, four, five..

1013
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,280
You've gained quite a bit
of weight back already.

1014
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm thinking of seven to eight
kilograms soon too.

1015
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,560
Don't be like that.
