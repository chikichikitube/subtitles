1
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:18,300
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:22,533
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,767
It's a bit surprising,

4
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:35,934
but I've been getting a lot of remarks
from people who don't work in comedy

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,867
about Documental.

6
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,767
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO

7
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:44,467
They say it truly is funny.

8
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:48,734
-That's what amazes me.
-Sitting down and Sharon Stone-ing.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,533
After all, I wouldn't call this
a very refined show.

10
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:56,767
I was really surprised when Rola said,
"I want in."

11
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,700
ROLA - "I WANT IN"

12
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,934
I thought,
"What? What's going on in your head?"

13
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,867
She said, "I can do it."

14
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,333
ROLA - "I CAN DO IT"

15
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,400
We've made small changes each season.

16
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,800
SEASON 2: "POINT SYSTEM"

17
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:14,200
IF THERE'S A DRAW AFTER 6 HOURS,
WHOEVER GOT THE MOST LAUGHS WINS

18
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,567
SEASON 3: "ZOMBIE TIME"
ELIMINATED PLAYERS RETURN AS ZOMBIES

19
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,300
Making slight adjustments
has worked out well.

20
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:24,533
I've added something
a little different this time, too.

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,567
SEASON 5: "A NEW EXPERIMENT"

22
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:30,633
They're allowed to bring somebody
completely unrelated into the room.

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,433
SEASON 5: "HELPER SYSTEM"

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,800
EACH PLAYER CAN BRING INTO
THE ROOM ONE "HELPER" AS A WEAPON

25
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:38,066
They could even bring in a stray dog.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,367
-So, the comedians know this?
-They've been told.

27
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:47,667
I don't know if they'll all use a Helper.
Some may say, "I'm fine without one."

28
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:51,467
USE OF THE HELPER SYSTEM IS LEFT
TO EACH CONTESTANT'S DISCRETION

29
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,967
I won't reveal yet
how many have brought a Helper.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,667
THE ENDING I WANT TO SEE

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,100
I think
it's high time for an "instant kill."

32
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,266
INSTANT KILL

33
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,467
"Instant" is an exaggeration, but...

34
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,533
ALL PREVIOUS SEASONS TOOK
SIX HOURS TO DETERMINE A WINNER

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,367
Nobody's won in an hour yet.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,700
But it's like boxing.
First-round knockouts can happen.

37
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,700
I WANT TO SEE A FIRST-ROUND K.O.

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,367
ON THE LAWLESS BATTLEGROUND

39
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,633
Usually I play cheerful characters

40
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,300
All the members are finally here

41
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:29,400
IMPROMPTU TEAMWORK RUNS WILD

42
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:30,734
TEN ENEMIES

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,834
They're all enemies, but at the same time,
it's about team play, too.

44
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,233
WORKING TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE OTHERS

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,200
If they interrupted each other's bits,
the show wouldn't work.

46
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:46,500
In that sense, I think comedians
truly are a bunch of gentlemen.

47
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,166
A BUNCH OF GENTLEMEN

48
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,300
Even though these gentlemen
whip out their penises.

49
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,967
But they do it in a gentlemanly way.

50
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,734
IN A GENTLEMANLY WAY

51
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,734
As gentlemen.

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,867
AS NOBLES

53
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,233
They do it as nobles.

54
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,066
THOUGHTS GOING INTO SEASON 5

55
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,567
It's an interesting thing.

56
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,500
I host oogiri-themed TV shows.

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,100
I do talk-based shows,
like Suberanai Hanashi.

58
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,300
I judge sketch comedy competitions, too.

59
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:21,533
I know how each comedian
has their strong suit.

60
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:26,300
Now it's becoming clearer in my head

61
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:29,000
which kind of comedian
is best suited for Documental.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,567
I did it!

63
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,300
-Good for you!
-That was amazing.

64
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,433
-Cookie won.
-What? What? Really? What?

65
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,300
I think we'll have to gather the winners
and host a grand championship one day.

66
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,300
LOOKING FORWARD
TO A GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP

67
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,200
Yesterday I watered the potted plants
in my yard.

68
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,567
This morning I was surprised
to see sheets of ice on them.

69
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,100
But I was told the plants would be fine.

70
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,934
The hardiness of plants is amazing.

71
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,166
I send you this invitation
with my best intentions.

72
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,367
I sincerely hope you will join me

73
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,767
with one million yen on your person.

74
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,667
I am hosting Documental.

75
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:36,300
I have prepared 10 million yen
as the champion's prize.

76
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,934
Whether to participate or not,
decision is yours.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,133
If you are willing to participate,
I will contact you again

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,066
regarding the time and venue.

79
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,533
I look forward to your reply.

80
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:52,533
As spring approaches,
I hope it will bring you happiness.

81
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,233
Sincerely, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,367
THE COMEDIANS ARRIVE AT THE BATTLEFIELD

83
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,467
He brought a large bag.

84
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:24,967
Am I the first?

85
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm the first player?

86
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,233
For Akiyama, it's like he's back
on old stomping grounds.

87
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,834
This room hasn't changed at all.

88
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,166
It's still the same.

89
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,467
I'm Ryuji Akiyama,
from the comedy group Robert.

90
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,033
Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,767
I think it's time I won.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,333
Excuse me.

93
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,667
What's this?

94
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:49,767
I know this envelope.

95
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,000
Please take it.

96
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,467
It's the same every time.

97
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,633
THE THIRD INVITATION

98
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,734
Even the way you entered the room.

99
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,333
Akiyama is very versatile.
He can pretty much do everything.

100
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,133
MR. ALL-ROUNDER

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,000
And he's very well-suited to Documental.

102
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,367
He's more than ready to win.

103
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,967
ONE OF THE FAVORITES

104
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:12,033
What comes to mind is
that bit with Kenkoba.

105
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,600
SEASON 3 - WITH KENDO KOBAYASHI
DURING ZOMBIE TIME

106
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,767
"THE CHINESE MASSAGE LADY
AND HER CUSTOMER"

107
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,533
It was amazing.

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,567
It wasn't something I'd had in store.

109
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,700
I was simply imitating
a massage lady I knew.

110
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,567
There has never been an occasion
when my private activities

111
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:34,900
worked more to the advantage
of my comedy performance than that time.

112
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,233
Don't say he's not here.

113
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,200
THE HUMAN BULLET
POSSESSED CREATOR

114
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:44,700
But some people are still able
to keep straight faces,

115
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,700
so I need to kick it up a notch.

116
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,967
BECOMING "POSSESSED"
BEYOND ALL EXPECTATIONS

117
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm not a first-timer anymore.

118
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,433
I can't just reprise the patterns
my seniors created.

119
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,033
SEEKING NEW REALMS OF COMEDY

120
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,367
I can't hitch rides
on others' jokes either.

121
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:01,367
ORIGINALITY

122
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,033
I want to bring unique weapons
to the battle.

123
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,467
Ah, this feeling.

124
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,333
All I really want is to hear one phrase
from comedians who saw the show:

125
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,367
"Hey, that really made me laugh."

126
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,667
PROVING HE'S A "ONE-AND-ONLY CREATOR"

127
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:23,300
Everything is the same.
Completely. Even the interior.

128
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,900
Here's another one.

129
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,033
We have a first-timer.

130
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,333
Really?

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,266
Akiyama!

132
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,400
Really?

133
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:47,233
I'm Takahashi from Savanna.
I brought one million yen.

134
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,767
I sure want to turn it into 10 million.

135
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,400
Hello.

136
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:57,867
What?

137
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,967
You want me?

138
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,200
You think you can get away with anything

139
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,800
if you say it's on Mr. Matsumoto's orders?

140
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,767
Takahashi is more of a brainy type.

141
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:08,967
MR. BRAINY

142
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:13,066
I think rather than doing physical comedy,
he'll work the room slyly.

143
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,233
SLY STYLE

144
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:19,066
I think he'll pace himself
and keep a safe distance from the action.

145
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,100
THE SUPER BROWN-NOSING COMEDIAN

146
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,834
I always look like I'm smiling.
People have always said that.

147
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,066
NATURALLY SMILEY

148
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,300
When I was in high school,

149
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:32,233
I was harassed by a gang of teens
three times.

150
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Each time they came up and said,
"What's so funny?"

151
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,233
"WHAT'S SO FUNNY?"

152
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Will this be considered laughing?

153
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,100
-It will.
-It will?

154
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,700
You are laughing.

155
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,967
This is no good? How about this?

156
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,934
-It'll be an out.
-An out?

157
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,767
NATURALLY SMILEY

158
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:54,800
If I'm not a tough judge on Takahashi,
I'll have another "Fujimoto issue."

159
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,233
THE FUJIMOTO ISSUE

160
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,033
People accuse me of going
too easy on Fujimoto.

161
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,266
I've never gone easy on him.

162
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,533
Takahashi.

163
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,400
You were invited?

164
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,700
I think that in any kind of competition,

165
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,367
the guys who win are able to picture
themselves doing so beforehand.

166
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,266
I can't picture a thing,

167
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,633
so I came here today thinking
I probably won't win 10 million.

168
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,467
AIMING FOR A SELFLESS VICTORY

169
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,567
-I can't picture it.
-What?

170
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:26,066
I have no idea how you will act.

171
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,066
I can't predict
how you will attack at all.

172
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,033
Morning.

173
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,567
Here comes a big fish.

174
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,567
A big fish.

175
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,800
-A very big fish.
-Why do you say that?

176
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:45,700
I didn't--

177
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,934
These are three totally different players.

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,834
Good morning.

179
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,000
It's stark when they're together.

180
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,667
Hello, I'm Eikoh Kano
from Maseki Geinosha.

181
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,100
Wait, could this be...

182
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm in trouble.

183
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,667
I think he's good.

184
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:07,000
He may not admit it himself,
but he's goofy.

185
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,233
THE NATURAL GOOFBALL

186
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,533
-It's your first time, right?
-It is.

187
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,266
What does Documental mean to you?

188
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,367
It's a sumo ring.

189
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,900
It's a place where comedians clash.

190
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,433
Each brings their own weapon...

191
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,934
Well, they don't use weapons in sumo...

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,867
I'd say it's a battlefield.

193
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,367
I'm changing my answer.

194
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,767
It's a battlefield.

195
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,667
THE NARCISSISTIC
PRANK VICTIM

196
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,567
He tends to go on the offensive
in situations like this.

197
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:37,967
SURPRISINGLY AGGRESSIVE

198
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,133
But he's not funny at all.

199
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,233
But the fact that his jokes aren't funny
may actually become his weapon.

200
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,266
Whenever I get invited
to talk shows and stuff,

201
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,600
I often stammer, or say the wrong thing.

202
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,800
LIVING OFF UNINTENTIONAL HUMOR

203
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:56,867
Since people laugh when I mess up,
I never get to say my punchline.

204
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,967
To be honest, getting that kInd
of laughs is not what i want.

205
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,967
HE'S DISAPPOINTED

206
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,533
This time, I want to make the others laugh

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,333
with jokes and props that I prepared.

208
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:11,700
I have never won any titles.
Not the R-1 Grand Prix. Nothing.

209
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,133
HAS THE TITLE-LESS COMEDIAN'S TIME COME?

210
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,100
I did win once
on Tsurukou's radio show...

211
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,400
THAT TIME ON TSURUKOU'S RADIO SHOW...

212
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,600
Just once. There were three competitors.

213
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,333
RANKED NUMBER ONE, OUT OF THREE

214
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,266
Have we seen each other
since your comeback?

215
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,533
Let me see... No, we haven't.

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,367
Have you always had those lines
on your cheeks?

217
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,433
What? I lost that much weight?

218
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,667
Maybe it's been too long...

219
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,367
I guess he's been under
a lot of emotional distress.

220
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,367
This is scary.

221
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,266
Really?

222
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,800
Are you serious?

223
00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:01,200
Well, I guess this would be
a little surprising to the others.

224
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,300
My name is Tomonori Jinnai.

225
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm still thinking of going home.

226
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,133
I want to go home.

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,800
-Good evening.
-Long time no see.

228
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,367
It came...

229
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,934
-You know the story?
-Of course.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
You need to prepare one million yen.

231
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,100
One million yen is not the problem.

232
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:29,533
I'd rather just hand over one million
and stay away from this.

233
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
This is going to be interesting.

234
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:38,633
He's the type of comedian
who is good at playing with people.

235
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,500
SHINES BY TEASING PEOPLE

236
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,533
So I expect him to do a good job.

237
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,900
MR. SOLO PLAYER

238
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,433
One thing I'm worried about
regarding Jinnai is

239
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,834
when it comes to oogiri games,
he's not funny at all.

240
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:57,934
I don't have one-punch gags.

241
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:03,233
I'm useless when it comes to making
people laugh instantly.

242
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,266
The other players won't just be good.
They'll be like top goalscoring forwards.

243
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,100
I AM NOT A FORWARD

244
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,066
How will I...
And then I get a police car siren.

245
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,500
EVEN RANDOM HAPPENSTANCE IS AGAINST HIM

246
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
When I had dinner with Jinnai
late last year,

247
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,000
we discussed what we'd do
if we were invited to Documental.

248
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,066
Yeah, we did.

249
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,100
-I said I'd definitely decline.
-You did, right?

250
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:28,934
I didn't bring anything
you might call a weapon,

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,033
so all I can hope for is
to win by counterattacking.

252
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,767
THE GAME PLAN IS "COUNTERATTACK"

253
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Well... How many more are coming?

254
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,934
-Six more.
-Six.

255
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:44,800
So far we don't have many
who like to take off their clothes.

256
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,333
only brought a bag to hold the money.

257
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,367
There's a stick... A very long stick.

258
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,867
-This show is the peak!
-I know. I get it.

259
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:58,934
In Kano's case...

260
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,467
-Good morning.
-Really?

261
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,934
What a lineup!

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,266
-He brought so much.
-That's how much you should bring.

263
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,066
This brings out your true colors.

264
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
I see.

265
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,233
I'd be scared without props.

266
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,300
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

267
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:18,967
He's the King of Conte champion.

268
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,667
I'm Kenji Yamauchi of Kamaitachi.

269
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:28,900
They say King of Conte 2017 was
the highest-level competition in history.

270
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,166
I come here fresh after winning that.

271
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,300
It came!

272
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,266
It came.

273
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm in!

274
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:39,500
You are?

275
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:43,900
I think I have achieved enough
to get an invitation.

276
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,934
I DESERVE TO BE INVITED

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,266
I wouldn't want to compete against him.
Not Yamauchi.

278
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,000
He doesn't laugh much, and he keeps
a poker face when he attacks.

279
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,600
POKER-FACED KING OF CONTE

280
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,800
His face gives him an unfair advantage.

281
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,567
UNFAIR FACE

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,433
THE REGULAR WINNER OF CONTESTS

283
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,967
He may be one of the top contenders.

284
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,667
-What do you think?
-Go for it.

285
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,100
Will you lend me 500,000?

286
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,934
WILL YOU LEND ME 500,000?

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,133
Then give me 5,000,000 if you win.
Of course, no problem.

288
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,400
Keep in mind
that's only a verbal agreement.

289
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,834
Who'd lend you money after hearing that?

290
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:24,166
Now is a very important time in my career,

291
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,567
so I really will aim to win.

292
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,066
-It's your first time, right?
-It is.

293
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,734
I watch it... I used to.

294
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,767
It's a show I only used to watch.

295
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,700
I know this will make me sound greedy,

296
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,800
but I want to make the others
laugh their asses off,

297
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,700
and after I've gained
everyone's admiration,

298
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,633
then I want the 10 million.

299
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,467
MAKE AN IMPACT AND 10 MILLION YEN

300
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:55,633
-There's a million yen in there?
-Yes.

301
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,000
-In your "22" bag.
-In here, yes.

302
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,467
I had such a hard time raising it.

303
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,633
But you won all that prize money.

304
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,867
-Yeah.
-It's gone.

305
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,533
-You spent it already?
-Yes.

306
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,166
I gave some to my parents,
and I paid off all the debts I had.

307
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,633
I had no money left,
so I went to Yoshimoto Finance for a loan,

308
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,934
but they turned me down.

309
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,567
They didn't give you a loan?

310
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,900
-That sounds like a giant.
-That does.

311
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:29,934
Seriously?

312
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,100
-Jin's here!
-We had drinks the other day!

313
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,767
-"Is the red panda..."
-"Still standing?"

314
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,600
Unbelievable.

315
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:41,934
Hi. I'm the comedy world's fantasista,
Kenji Tamura.

316
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Cha!

317
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,433
TAMURA'S GRILL RESTAURANT

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,166
This is for you.

319
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,000
I got one.

320
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,567
I've always thought
this show would suit him.

321
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,900
I've been trying to get him on
for a while.

322
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,633
Among today's contestants,

323
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,200
he's the toughest when it comes
to having nobody laugh at you.

324
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,266
That's his strength.

325
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,633
STRONG NERVES

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,100
SIDE BUSINESS KING OF KANSAI

327
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,967
And he has the virtual currency issue.

328
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,934
The human race created
the industrial revolution.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,734
We switched from horses to cars.

330
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,500
Our productivity and transport capacity
increased drastically.

331
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,834
The human race evolved at great speed.

332
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,100
TAMURA TALK:
THE WONDERS OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY

333
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:33,400
Now it's happening in the currency market.
It's an industrial revolution.

334
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:36,000
He's a miser, more than anything.

335
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,500
His fixation on the prize money
will be stronger than anyone else's.

336
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,633
MISER

337
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:47,233
Nowadays people see me as
a grill restaurant owner.

338
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
Or as an entrepreneur.

339
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:53,800
But I want to make them stop and think,
"No, no. Tamura Kenji is a comedian."

340
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,800
TAMURA THE COMEDIAN'S BIG BATTLE

341
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,734
When I was younger,
I didn't care about the audience.

342
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,266
Wherever they were.

343
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,600
All I tried to do was
make the other comedians laugh.

344
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:08,433
I had a chip on my shoulder.
I always told Jinnai to go and die.

345
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,367
If I can go back to who I was then,

346
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,033
then I may have a chance of winning.

347
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,433
You're part of the comeback group.

348
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,467
-The comeback group?
-Him and you.

349
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,133
-Is this your comeback?
-I wasn't suspended.

350
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,900
-Oh, that's right.
-He wasn't suspended.

351
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,967
-I was never suspended.
-You weren't? But you deserved to be.

352
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,100
-You and Campylobacter.
-That's what causes food poisoning.

353
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,834
My restaurant got "suspended" for that.

354
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,800
-So Tamura is here...
-Give me a break.

355
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,700
-Wearing sunglasses is unfair.
-You're right.

356
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,500
-Someone's here.
-They are?

357
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,367
-Unbelievable!
-I'm scared!

358
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:54,767
Tamura, you're here?

359
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,333
-You've been on before.
-No way.

360
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,133
Jinnai, you got a haircut!

361
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,734
That's what people do.

362
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,633
-This is too much.
-Now wait a minute!

363
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,734
Hi, I'm Kendo Kobayashi.

364
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:08,633
Fortunately enough,

365
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,467
the public affectionately call me
"Koba Ken."

366
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,633
HOTEL
4 HOURS - 4,500 YEN

367
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:19,967
Oh, no...

368
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,934
-What are you doing here?
-I'm looking for comedy material.

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
LOOKING FOR LAUGHS
IN THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT

370
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,934
Jinnai, Kobayashi, and Tamura
were actually classmates at NSC.

371
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,233
THREE MEMBERS OF NSC'S 11TH CLASS

372
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,834
Seeing the three of them in one room

373
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,767
may be quite a feast for comedy fans.

374
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,233
GOOD FRIENDS AND ARCH RIVALS

375
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,834
Kobayashi has been here before,

376
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,433
so he may be feeling a little defensive
towards the other two.

377
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,967
Like, "This is my turf."

378
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,700
DOCUMENTAL IS MY TURF

379
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,734
THE EROTIC TENOR
WITH NO DOUBTS

380
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,900
I realized that I can't win

381
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:05,166
by playing the way I did last time.

382
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,467
I had unfinished business
and it was starting to nag me.

383
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,667
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

384
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,433
"THE CHINESE MASSAGE LADY
AND HER CUSTOMER"

385
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,100
I beat myself up
for not ejaculating that time.

386
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,934
WHY COULDN'T I EJACULATE?

387
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,600
I really regret it.

388
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
Last time, I didn't want to win that much.

389
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,834
Being funny was more important.

390
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,166
LAUGHTER OVER VICTORY

391
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,800
This time, I wanNA win more than be funny.

392
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,166
VICTORY OVER LAUGHTER

393
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,700
And I want to ejaculate more than
I want to win.

394
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,200
EJACULATION OVER VICTORY

395
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:40,367
If Jinnai puts on a silly costume
and does something silly on this table,

396
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,000
I might cry.

397
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,333
If he does, laugh.

398
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,500
Why not laugh?

399
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,033
-He made it to where he is now...
-Laugh, please.

400
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,033
...without doing that kind of stuff.
That's who he is.

401
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,133
-You're right.
-I agree.

402
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:57,166
That trait of Jinnai's
may actually work in his favor.

403
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,633
Now,

404
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,066
here comes another one.

405
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,433
-Those sunglasses aren't fair.
-I know, I know.

406
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,800
Don't be so jumpy.

407
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,633
Is he gathering all the classmates?

408
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,400
-He used to be with Yoshimoto.
-They're getting all of the 11th class!

409
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,967
Zakoshi!

410
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,467
Jinnai's here!

411
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,967
-It's like Nichome Theater.
-Three of you!

412
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,900
Hi. I'm Hollywood Zakoshisyoh.

413
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,333
-How are you doing?
-Sorry?

414
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:37,033
An invitation to Documental?

415
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,266
It finally came?

416
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,500
IT FINALLY CAME

417
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,767
I have to say he gets me a lot.

418
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,033
COCKROACHMAN

419
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,367
He has his own universe,
so he may actually surprise us.

420
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,300
TOP CONTENDER?

421
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,567
If he were my daughter's boyfriend,
it would be a real nightmare.

422
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,867
A NIGHTMARE IF HE WAS
MY DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND

423
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:59,066
A REPERTOIRE OF 200 MILLION IMPERSONATIONS

424
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:03,166
THE KING OF ARABIKI

425
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,967
-You're worried, aren't you?
-I am.

426
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,033
This is not good.

427
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,233
Hey, Eikoh is here!

428
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,967
Your voice is so loud.

429
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:12,600
-This is my big chance!
-He's happy to be here.

430
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,333
FOUR MEMBERS OF NSC'S 11TH CLASS

431
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,967
No restrictions on what you can say or do.
Who could beat me?

432
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,633
THE BEST WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS

433
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,033
Some people mount attacks,
while others don't.

434
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,133
What the hell is with those guys who
do nothing apart from trying not to laugh?

435
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
ATTACKS ARE WHAT MAKES DOCUMENTAL

436
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,900
I'll personify that spirit for you.

437
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,400
I am the true Documental.

438
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,967
I'M THE REAL DOCUMENTAL

439
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,567
Hollywood Zakoshisyoh, unveiled.

440
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,867
You don't even see 10% of me on TV.

441
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,600
THEY CAN'T SHOW ME ON TV

442
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,367
I'll show them what crazy is.

443
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,934
I want to show real insanity.

444
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,834
INSANE

445
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,767
My chances of winning just went up
thanks to you.

446
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,133
What do you mean?

447
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,633
I'm not going to laugh.

448
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,734
I'll never laugh.

449
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:59,667
I'm sure everyone will be surprised
to see this next person.

450
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,367
He didn't bring anything.
He's empty-handed.

451
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,734
-Are you serious?
-It's Junior.

452
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,166
It's a class reunion.

453
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,767
-You're right.
-It was nice and cozy in here.

454
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,000
It was brave of you
to accept this, Junior.

455
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,433
Hi, I'm Chihara Junior.

456
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:28,266
I'm excited to finally be invited.

457
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,400
Excuse me.

458
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,500
-Hello.
-Yes?

459
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:38,066
This invitation... There's no comedian
who doesn't know this.

460
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,333
IT FINALLY CAME

461
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,767
I wonder what he'll do.

462
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,867
I have no idea how he will play.

463
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,333
HOW WILL JUNIOR FIGHT?

464
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
To be honest, I thought this show
had nothing to do with me.

465
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,033
AN UNEXPECTED INVITATION

466
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:54,900
THE THEORY-LOVING ONOMATOPOEIC
MAESTRO OF CHATTER

467
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,367
-I can't believe you're here.
-Wait a minute. I don't stand a chance.

468
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,500
He's at the next level in his career.

469
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,133
ONE LEVEL ABOVE THE OTHERS

470
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,133
So I'm curious to see what he'll do.

471
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,567
HOW WILL HE FIGHT?

472
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,500
Rather than wondering if he'll win,

473
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,133
I'd like to see him reveal
a Junior we've never seen before.

474
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,734
JUNIOR AS NEVER SEEN BEFORE

475
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,533
I didn't bring anything with me.

476
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,033
I CAME WITH NO WEAPONS

477
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,100
I decided not to think about it.

478
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:22,200
There's no use thinking about it.

479
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,667
FIGHTING AS I AM

480
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:27,467
I don't have any tricks that I do
backstage just for comedians.

481
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,333
I truly dislike parties
where many people are present.

482
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:34,800
I have virtually no experience
working in groups.

483
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,066
Technically speaking,
I only graduated from grade school.

484
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:43,633
I'd like to know myself
what will become of me.

485
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,300
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME

486
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,900
Hello.

487
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,533
-It's Kano.
-Thank you.

488
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,567
When the last one enters...

489
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,834
I had no idea.

490
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,867
I'm sure the atmosphere
will change dramatically again.

491
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,166
Here they come.

492
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,767
Is it a woman?

493
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:09,433
It wasn't supposed to be a woman.
Maybe he became a woman.

494
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,567
No more from Osaka, please.

495
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,266
It couldn't be worse.

496
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,000
-This is the worst.
-Again?

497
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,467
It couldn't be worse.

498
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,700
You again?

499
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,200
My name is Jimmy Onishi.

500
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,734
This time...

501
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,967
I'm hoping to win.

502
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:32,633
What's this?

503
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,033
Oh, no!

504
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,667
The time is ripe.

505
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,300
AFTER A TWO-SEASON ABSENCE

506
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,433
I kicked him out for a while.

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,133
I had to impose
an economic sanction on him.

508
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,767
ECONOMIC SANCTION

509
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:51,700
I didn't think it was a good idea
to let him keep coming back.

510
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,967
I was afraid he may succeed
in creating a nuclear weapon.

511
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,767
HE MAY CREATE A NUCLEAR WEAPON

512
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,033
NATURAL-BORN NUCLEAR FUSION

513
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:02,834
In my mind, Cookie and Jimmy
come with a "Do Not Mix" warning.

514
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,166
WHEN COOKIE'S IN,
JIMMY STAYS OUT

515
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:08,000
They're like Nodong and Taepodong.

516
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,500
NODONG AND TAEPODONG

517
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,133
They're the two lethal weapons
of this show.

518
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,800
It'd be dangerous
to bring them in too often.

519
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,533
After the second appearance,

520
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,800
other comedians told me I was funny...

521
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,500
quite a lot.

522
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,867
A SOLID RESPONSE

523
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,166
HE EVEN MAKES HIMSELF LAUGH

524
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,233
I'm Hideko from Uguisudani.

525
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,200
What did you say?

526
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm Hideko, from Uguisudani.

527
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,533
The infamous Tokyo town?

528
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,033
You stopped sounding Osakan.

529
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
So far I've lost two million yen.

530
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,467
Yoshimoto Finance won't
lend to me anymore.

531
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,567
NOT EVEN YOSHIMOTO
WILL GIVE HIM A LOAN

532
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,033
If I lose again,

533
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,667
I'm a genna... gotta...

534
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,900
It means I'll be working for free
for the next six months.

535
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,100
How pathetic is that? For this one try.

536
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,600
DOCUMENTAL'S SADDEST STORY

537
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,433
-I won't laugh.
-What should I do?

538
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,934
-Two, four, five... Ten?
-Everyone's here.

539
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,967
-All ten of us.
-What should I do?

540
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,166
Tamura and Zakoshi boost my chances.

541
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,867
Shut up. You keep saying--

542
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:30,834
-This feels weird.
-Yeah.

543
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,767
What is this?

544
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,867
Maybe it's because
we always get together like this.

545
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:37,533
It's like we're in a dressing room.

546
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,567
I didn't expect Junior to come.

547
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,266
Good morning.

548
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,367
Why this lineup?

549
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,233
What is this?

550
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,000
Jimmy, why did you...

551
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:58,200
Is that your "neutral" position?
Is that where you start?

552
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,567
This is where I start.

553
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,266
-Where do you go from there?
-Exactly.

554
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,967
He's definitely wasted one.

555
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,700
-He's already started.
-You've already shown a hand.

556
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:07,700
You don't mind?

557
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,066
It's okay. I start here.

558
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,834
We've already seen it.

559
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,867
-It's okay.
-We're growing used to you.

560
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:15,633
This... This has nothing to do
with my jokes.

561
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,800
Nothing?

562
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,767
-This is your blank canvas.
-It is.

563
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,367
It's your base character?

564
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:22,266
Now, everyone.

565
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,500
You don't need to hear
the rules anymore, right?

566
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,667
Everyone brings one million yen.

567
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,467
The last one standing will win 10 million.

568
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
-Yes.
-Good so far?

569
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:37,500
If you laugh,
there are yellow, orange, and red cards.

570
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,567
A red card means you're eliminated.

571
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,033
We've been changing the rules a bit
each season.

572
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,200
1 - IF ALL PLAYERS LAUGH AT ZOMBIES
THERE IS A NO-CONTEST

573
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:48,100
2- ZOMBIES MAY ATTACK LAST PLAYER
UNTIL 6 HOURS ARE UP

574
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,266
As you already know,
this time you can bring a Helper.

575
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,600
The Helpers will appear from here.

576
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,133
And you can use them once as your weapon.

577
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,934
However, it will be a problem
if the Helper sticks around for hours.

578
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,266
So they can only stay here
for a few minutes.

579
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,800
And since everyone has brought
one million yen, I have too.

580
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,834
Thank you.

581
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,600
I'll rip it open...

582
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,000
Like some kind of fast-food chicken.

583
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,166
Keeps your hand clean.

584
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,700
-Your hand stays clean.
-It won't get dirty.

585
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:21,967
It's clean money.

586
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,033
I see.

587
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,667
Now, please pass the money to the front.

588
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:30,734
Here it is.

589
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,767
You each bring different sentiments...

590
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,834
This one million yen
is filled with a lot of emotions.

591
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:42,166
Some have brought a loose pile
but I'm going to trust you.

592
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,300
Is this 10 million?

593
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:48,633
-Maybe cash does beat virtual currency.
-This is very real money.

594
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:53,533
This is different from getting money
from an ATM.

595
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,667
This is 10 million.

596
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:56,867
This goes here.

597
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,567
-10 million.
-Exactly.

598
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,700
And this makes it 11 million yen.

599
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,433
Of course,
the amount you paid is subtracted,

600
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,900
so the winner wins 10 million as a prize.

601
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:10,433
However, since there are circumstances
that concern the grown-ups,

602
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,433
we must switch that pile with this one,

603
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,533
or we'll be in trouble.

604
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:20,834
This is it?

605
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,300
Like money laundering?

606
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,233
Money laundering...

607
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
There's something, apparently.

608
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,166
There are some complicated rules.

609
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,000
Yamauchi, are you okay?

610
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm fine.

611
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:33,667
You don't seem fine.

612
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,166
Do you see something
that makes you concerned?

613
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,867
It's just, you got quiet.

614
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:42,700
I left Osaka at about 8:00 and stayed
in the dressing room for a long time.

615
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,533
I'm feeling a bit tired.

616
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,266
You came from Osaka?

617
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,433
Yes, from Osaka.

618
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,033
Mr. Matsumoto.

619
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,633
My natural, normal face looks like...

620
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,700
Like you're smiling, right?

621
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,633
Well, to a certain degree...

622
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,066
How can I put it?

623
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,567
It's a bit tricky.

624
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,367
-He's smiling now, right?
-This is considered smiling?

625
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:06,900
Try to look a little more formidable
than usual.

626
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:07,967
Formidable?

627
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,834
He does tend to smirk when he talks.

628
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
He's making an excuse for later.

629
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:15,100
Just try to look a little stern.

630
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,467
Is this face okay?

631
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,700
That's smiling.

632
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,133
Okay!

633
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm going to base my judgment on
whether it's your normal face or not.

634
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,467
-But I--
-I always get criticism.

635
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,667
Fujimoto's not here today,
but they say I go easy on him.

636
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:36,600
But you know, we're all playing as a team.
After all, this is a TV show.

637
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,500
Leave the judgment to me. I'll handle it.

638
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,367
-I see.
-You okay, Jimmy?

639
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,667
My hands got stuck on the bullet train.

640
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,333
-My hands.
-Why?

641
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,934
-They got stuck on the bullet train.
-Stuck where?

642
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,867
In the door.

643
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,800
-The door of a bullet train?
-The bullet train door.

644
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:53,433
-In between the doors?
-Yeah.

645
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,934
They did. Look. So...

646
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,467
-That's why they're red?
-Yes.

647
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:57,834
Why say that now?

648
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,367
So you rode the train like that?

649
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:02,633
I rode like this.

650
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,000
They were outside, right?

651
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,600
Your fingers were outside?

652
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,934
From around Hamamatsu.

653
00:33:08,734 --> 00:33:11,433
-Why did the door open there?
-It doesn't stop there.

654
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,967
Why did they open at Hamamatsu?

655
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,367
Why did you tell that funny story now?

656
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,800
Why did you get close to the doors
at Hamamatsu?

657
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,166
I wanted to buy an eel bento box.

658
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
He gave a normal reason.

659
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,066
-A kiosk was right outside the doors--
-He's still going.

660
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,233
He just keeps talking.

661
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,467
-Then the door slammed?
-It slammed shut.

662
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,567
I would have laughed
if he'd said it during the game.

663
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:38,100
-Why did he say that now?
-No way. I'm in trouble.

664
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,767
-Until Tokyo Station?
-Tokyo...

665
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,367
No, it opened at Shin-Yokohama.
I was so relieved.

666
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,333
But my hands ended up like this.

667
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:46,400
-Why waste that bit?
-That was close!

668
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,834
The game starts
when the lights in the room change.

669
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,033
Have a great time.

670
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,300
-You're free until then.
-We can still laugh?

671
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:55,834
No way.

672
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,967
Do your best.

673
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,400
-How long do we have?
-No way.

674
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:01,133
What do we do with our bags?

675
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,967
We can put them away.

676
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:04,000
No way.

677
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,700
-I'll put my bag away.
-Me too.

678
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:06,867
Can we go now?

679
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,533
We can put our bags away?

680
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,700
Season 5!

681
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,233
Starts now.

682
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,834
-It's already been 20-30 minutes, right?
-It has.

683
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,333
-Since we came in.
-Right.

684
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,266
I was first.

685
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,433
It's started, right?

686
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,100
-It has.
-This is how it starts?

687
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,834
-Are you going to do something?
-No, no.

688
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,967
I'm just thirsty.

689
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,934
-What?
-I'm thirsty.

690
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:36,500
He's drinking it.

691
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:38,500
He emptied it.

692
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,567
-What did he drink?
-Mouthwash.

693
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,500
-Are you okay?
-Without diluting it?

694
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,734
-That's medical gargle.
-Medical gargle.

695
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,100
-You have to spit it out.
-It smells terrible!

696
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,300
-That stinks.
-That's not good, Jimmy.

697
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,800
I was just thirsty.

698
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:53,500
That's why you drank it?

699
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,834
Your throat will burn.

700
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,333
The smell is overwhelming.

701
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,934
-It stinks!
-Yeah, really.

702
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Hang on.
There was something else in there, right?

703
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,400
No, this smells like
the real one. Seriously.

704
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,734
Are you stupid?

705
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,400
But it doesn't say you can't drink it.

706
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:08,600
So it's okay to drink?

707
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,500
But it could be bad.

708
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,367
Well, maybe you can drink it...
But it can't be good.

709
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,467
Of course not!

710
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:15,633
You usually dilute it.

711
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,667
I don't feel good.

712
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:18,600
-You don't?
-Of course you don't.

713
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,700
-What's it like?
-Says do not use except for gargling.

714
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:22,800
I'm hot!

715
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,066
Your throat is burning!

716
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:26,400
My chest is burning.

717
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,633
That's not good.

718
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,867
Is it burning badly?

719
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:30,033
My chest is burning.

720
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,400
You should dilute it.

721
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,800
-You should drink some water.
-I'll drink water. I don't feel good.

722
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,700
-What are you doing?
-Not good.

723
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,400
How about swallowing an egg?

724
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:41,533
An egg sounds good.

725
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,800
Dilute it with this.

726
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:43,734
An egg...

727
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,233
-Because it creates a film?
-Yeah. So...

728
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:49,066
Sit down, look up and open your mouth.

729
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,367
It could be bad.

730
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,500
Are you ready?

731
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:55,667
Like this.

732
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,967
Let's dilute it.

733
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:05,934
How do you feel?

734
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,567
I think it's diluted a little.

735
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:13,300
-He's shaking.
-Why are you shaking?

736
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:14,734
From carbonic acid.

737
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:18,734
Junior and Takahashi came close.

738
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,500
One more?

739
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:22,767
Swallowing too much could be dangerous.

740
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,300
How can you just swallow it?

741
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:26,433
-I'm atopic.
-What?

742
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,967
Kano is too. Right?

743
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,700
-Are you allergic to eggs?
-No.

744
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,767
I'm atopic.

745
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,800
Kano is allergic to a lot of things.

746
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:35,900
What?

747
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,200
Allergies. What do you have again?

748
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,967
What are you allergic to?

749
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,433
Soy beans, pollen,

750
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,367
dogs, cats, house dust,

751
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,200
and my own sweat.

752
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,100
-Sweat...
-Your own sweat?

753
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,133
That's tough.

754
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,567
I'm allergic to sweat.

755
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:56,100
-You get itchy when you sweat.
-I get a bad heat rash.

756
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,900
-So, you want one of these?
-No, thank you.

757
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,100
-Why don't you have one?
-Yeah, why not?

758
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,100
Me?

759
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,734
Can you eat raw eggs?

760
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,533
I'm not allergic to eggs.

761
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
What is this? What are you doing?

762
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,500
Treatment!

763
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,934
Is this a treatment?

764
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,266
But he's not sick.

765
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,400
-What?
-What?

766
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,533
-See that?
-I was fine.

767
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,166
Me?

768
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,633
Tamura, what about your sunglasses?

769
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,033
Yeah. That's cheating!

770
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,800
You said you'd take them off.

771
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,467
Are you smiling?

772
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,367
I'm not.

773
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:34,834
Look at Zakoshi.

774
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,700
Look at him.

775
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:42,967
Look at Zakoshi.

776
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:46,333
Come on.

777
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,467
I can stand it.

778
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,800
Better take them off.

779
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,700
-It's hard to tell.
-You're right.

780
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,734
Then I'll go change.
This is uncomfortable.

781
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,066
Okay.

782
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,333
Right?

783
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,033
This isn't funny anymore, right?

784
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,567
What do you mean, "anymore"?

785
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
-It's not funny anymore.
-Anymore?

786
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:11,300
I'll go change.

787
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,900
We may laugh if you do a real "Cha"
in that outfit.

788
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,700
-With full force.
-A serious one.

789
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Cha.

790
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,166
-Nope.
-You're right. It won't work anymore.

791
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:25,166
-It was quieter than expected.
-Yeah.

792
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,000
-Was that it?
-Real one is quiet.

793
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,066
Everyone thinks the real one is loud.

794
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,667
It's full of melancholy.

795
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,166
-How's showbiz version?
-The live show version.

796
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,734
Your "Entertainment Cha."

797
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,567
Cha.

798
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,633
Like that.

799
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,967
-How about by a lazy river?
-By a lazy river?

800
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,433
There's a lot of background noise.

801
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,467
Cha!

802
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,700
That was a scream.

803
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:54,934
Junior...

804
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,233
-At the Rising Sun Rock Festival.
-Junior.

805
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,900
I hate oogiri games.

806
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:02,700
It's not oogiri.

807
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:05,266
It sounds like oogiri when you say it.

808
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,333
No, thank you.

809
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,100
Junior...

810
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,200
He's losing it.

811
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,600
That wasn't oogiri.

812
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,900
-But it sounds a lot like oogiri.
-The way he set it up, right?

813
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:21,667
But you change your "Cha" according
to the place and occasion, right?

814
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:26,700
I do. But when you start digging deeper,
it starts to become an oogiri game.

815
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,800
-Don't say that.
-You make me shrink up.

816
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,166
If you accuse me of that,
I can't say a thing.

817
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:32,800
Say something, Eikoh.

818
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:36,700
You shouldn't run away
from any challenges in this place.

819
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,333
If someone challenges you,
you have to give 100%.

820
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,834
Eikoh will do his joke, too.

821
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
By a lazy river.

822
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:45,767
A lazy river?

823
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,033
Everyone, listen up!

824
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:53,767
Ramen, tsukemen
and sexy men like me! Okay!

825
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:55,467
He was just loud.

826
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,433
That sweeping hand movement was great.

827
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Because the people float by?

828
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:00,834
His voice carries well.

829
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,800
The version you do when your dog dies.

830
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,300
See, it's oogiri.

831
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,600
When my dog dies?

832
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,133
Thank you.

833
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:12,700
Thank you.

834
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,600
Ramen, tsukemen and sexy men like me.

835
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,934
Okay!

836
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,900
It's not okay. The dog's dead.

837
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,500
But "Okay!" is part of the joke.

838
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:26,400
You did good.

839
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,967
Very good.

840
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
I'll give them a warning about that later.

841
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,667
That really could be bad.

842
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,033
It was a mistake.

843
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:38,300
Yes, it was.

844
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,967
I shouldn't have done it. I know now.

845
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,600
I put my body on the line.

846
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:44,500
You may get sick.

847
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,300
Is this really okay?

848
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:48,533
Try to swallow just a little.

849
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,500
No, it clearly says
"Do not use except for gargling."

850
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,500
But I'm sure my stomach got disinfected.

851
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,100
I guess so.

852
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,033
Zakoshi, I heard you had twins?

853
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,533
I have twins.

854
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,066
What are their names?

855
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:03,433
Hanma and Kanma.

856
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,900
-Bullshit.
-It's true.

857
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,500
Which kanji are used for "Hanma"?

858
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:10,066
The kanji for "half" and then "demon."

859
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,266
You could never use that.

860
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,200
And "Kanma"?

861
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:14,900
"Complete" and "demon."

862
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,033
Hanma and Kanma.

863
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,967
Calling your kid "demon" was a problem
a while back.

864
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:19,867
It's a girl.

865
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,200
They're twin girls?

866
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:23,633
A boy and a girl.

867
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,767
Which is which?

868
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,533
Hanma is.

869
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,233
A boy-girl.

870
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,834
You mean Kanma is a "boy-girl."

871
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,700
And Kanma is a girl-boy.

872
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:36,100
What if you have another?

873
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,934
They'll be Anbaran and Denderen.

874
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,367
-Anbaran and Denderen?
-Anbaran and Denderen.

875
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:45,233
If you have another set of twins?

876
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,900
Junior's out, right?

877
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:51,200
-Anbaran and...
-Anbaran and Kanbaran.

878
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:52,533
Anbaran and Kanbaran.

879
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,834
What about Denderen?

880
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,000
Denderen too... They're triplets.

881
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,433
If I have triplets, they'll be
Anbaran, Kanbaran, and Denderen.

882
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,533
If it's quadruplets, I'll add Dondoron.

883
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,934
Their names are Mai and Ami.

884
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,867
No, no, no.

885
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,100
-Mai and Ami?
-No, no.

886
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,400
-Those are normal, cute names.
-No, no.

887
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,600
And they're both girls?

888
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,867
-Are they really twins?
-No, no, no.

889
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,300
They're Headhunter A and Headhunter B.

890
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,200
That’s what those twin pro wrestlers
from W*ING were called.

891
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:22,233
How knowledgeable of you.

892
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,033
No, they're not. It's Miki? Mai? And?

893
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,700
-Miki and Tetsuya.
-Mai and Ami.

894
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,800
He's "Hollywood," so they're "Miami."

895
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:30,533
That's super normal.

896
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,834
-That's why?
-No, no.

897
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,100
He's wrong. They're Miki and Tetsuya.

898
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,233
Miki and Tetsuya.

899
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,367
-That's "Tetsuya Miki."
-Tetsuya Miki.

900
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:38,467
Tetsuya Miki.

901
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:40,200
-The "Doo-waa" guy?
-Right.

902
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:42,233
"It's me!"

903
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:45,867
The "It's Me Polka."

904
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:47,500
It's me!

905
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,900
"An over-exaggerated..." Shall I do it?

906
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,100
-"An over-exaggerated Tetsuya."
-Go for it.

907
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,734
That would've gotten me.

908
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,433
How about Junichiro Koizumi?

909
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,600
"An over-exaggerated Junichiro Koizumi."

910
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Hello.

911
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,133
I'm Junichiro Koizumi.

912
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:34,567
Junior...

913
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,367
You set it up!

914
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,800
-You came close so many times.
-Me?

915
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:50,967
That was close!

916
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,233
He set it up himself.

917
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,133
Was it me?

918
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,934
You smiled a few times, Junior.

919
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That was close!

920
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,300
Well, this is...

921
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,800
First of all, this applies to everyone.

922
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,100
You're drinking too much water.

923
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,633
The moment someone says something,

924
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:08,900
you bring a bottle to your mouth.

925
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,900
You hide by pouting your lips.

926
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:12,233
That's not good.

927
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,900
It's okay if you really are thirsty.

928
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,233
But let's not hold a bottle
to your mouth all the time.

929
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,033
And for now, there's one person to punish.

930
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:23,467
Junior.

931
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:25,900
-You scared me!
-This is scary.

932
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,734
I thought it might be me!

933
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,233
Hello.

934
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm Junichiro Koizumi.

935
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,433
Junior...

936
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,467
Basically, you were smiling at everything!

937
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:48,533
Junior is bombing!

938
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:51,867
And each time, he tried to hide it
with the water bottle!

939
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,100
No, no.

940
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,033
Zakoshi is dangerous!

941
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,233
-Zakoshi is dangerous.
-He's my weak spot.

942
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,333
That was too much.
I admire everyone for holding back.

943
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,734
His power was amazing.

944
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,600
Takahashi, you're close too.

945
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Takahashi and Junior
are always on the brink.

946
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,667
Zakoshi's my weak spot. Okay!

947
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:18,066
I wanted to put you all on your toes.
That's why I gave Junior...

948
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:19,400
I see.

949
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,266
...a yellow card.

950
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:23,867
Now, let's continue.

951
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:25,400
We're okay now?

952
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:26,600
That was fast!

953
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:27,500
It was.

954
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:28,900
You set it up yourself.

955
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,633
You kept setting up
your favorite kind of jokes.

956
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,500
I thought if I created the mood,
it would start to catch on.

957
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:47,100
Ouch!

958
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,900
Give me a break.

959
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:51,867
I'm half Japanese.

960
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:56,400
-That made me jump!
-Be careful, Golgo!

961
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:57,333
What's he doing?
