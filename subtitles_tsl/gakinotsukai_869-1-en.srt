1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,400
The series that nobody asked for :

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,080
Murakami Shoji's Class

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,920
For the first episode, they became ninjas;

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,080
Followed by the Green Berets.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,480
In episode 3, they became pirates.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,520
What could await them next?...

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,440
It's hot today, huh?

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, very hot.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,320
35 C!

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,400
Why the hell are we wearing this necktie in this heat?

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,040
What the hell is a pilot classroom?

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,520
I've never heard of a pilot classroom.
What the hell is a pilot classroom?

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
I've never heard of a pilot classroom.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
Being a pilot is completely different.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,240
He's been wanting to do this for a while...

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
Really?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,480
I really don't want to be here!
Really?

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,320
I really don't want to be here!

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Then let's just not do it.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,360
Let's just sleep on the bus.

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,600
Murakami used to be amazing when we joined Yoshimoto.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,480
He was part of "NG-II".

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
It was "NG-II", right?

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,200
It was really popular.

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,600
The Kombii "Shoji-Niichan" used to be in it.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,680
He was with Yuji-san.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,360
Is that so?
He was with Yuji-san.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,400
He was with Yuji-san.

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,600
Really?
He was with Yuji-san.

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Really?

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
It was SUPER popular.

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,000
NG-II?
It was SUPER popular.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,400
NG-II?

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
NG-II.

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,080
Maybe it would be better if we don't discuss this now.

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,560
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
When there was a comedy competition...

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,760
NG-II will deninitely win, is what everyone thought.

39
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Right as we joined... For about 4 years...

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,360
We were opponents in the finals...

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,800
...We beat them.

42
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,520
Don't mention it to him!

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,520
Translations by : Drageat

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
It's so freaking hot!

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,400
It's so hot!

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,280
I want to go home!

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,640
Why is it a sandy beach again?

48
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Where should we go?

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
There's something written here.

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,440
That sign looks really cheap.

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,680
"Pilot Classroom"

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,800
Do you think if we wait here, he will come?

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,400
Us waiting makes it seem like we want to be here...

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,400
He came.

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,600
What's that?
He came.

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,000
What's that?

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,680
There he is.

58
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:20,760
There he is.
There he is.

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
There he is.

60
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,520
Pilot instructor, Murakami Shoji finally appears.

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,600
He's looking really sharp!

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
He didn't have to go to this extent!

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,800
The stewardesses also look real.

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,800
Good morning!

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,640
What's up?

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,800
It's good to see you all.

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,200
What?

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,920
What did he say?

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,080
I said, "IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE."

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
Look at all those stripes on his arm.

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,400
Impressive.
Look at all those stripes on his arm.

72
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,440
We only have 3 or 4 stripes...

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
These stripes are all you can think of?!

74
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,720
These stripes are for...

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Airplane...

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Helicopter...

77
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,920
Fighter Jet...

78
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
Fixing a bicycle tire.

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,560
I have all of these licenses.

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,760
If you don't have all of these...

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
...You can't call yourself a first-rate pilot.

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,840
Although, we thought we would do this series monthly...

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,240
It's been a while, so our rhythm is off.

84
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm sure it is hard for you all to get used to again.

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,600
It's not that hard.

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
What the hell are you saying now?!

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,800
Your have to make up for your fathers mistakes.

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,000
Your dad couldn't become a pilot.

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,920
I hear he works in a school cafeteria now.

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,320
So your fathers dream... is now your own!

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
For now... Let us all become pilots.

92
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
Is it that easy to become one?

93
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,120
Shouldn't you say, "Let's do our best to become pilots"?

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,760
"Let's all become pilots" sounds strange.

95
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,760
I mean, let's all-

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,600
I can see you flying!

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
What was that?

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,360
What was what?

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,120
It- It's like how you greet your classmates when you were in school.

100
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,200
So, if we see a plane we should do that?

101
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,960
A pilot must do that.

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm sorry, of course.

103
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,560
That is one of the most important rules as a pilot...

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
Actually, it is a mission.

105
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
It's common sense!

106
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,840
Of course.
It's common sense!

107
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:03,880
It's common sense!

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,280
Sorry, but what does she have to do with anything?

109
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,640
Her?

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,280
We just arrived, coming from Pinumpin.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,200
The sky is looking lovely today, huh?

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,840
I understand warika...

113
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,200
What?
I understand warika...

114
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,600
What?

115
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Warika?

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,040
The sky looks good today, huh?
Warika?

117
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
The sky looks good today, huh?

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,000
I understand, Murakami.

119
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,680
She can't say it properly.

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,560
I brought you all presents today.

121
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,840
Really? Thank you.

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
I got you...

123
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,160
A very heart-felt gift.

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
You got it from "Duty Free"?

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,320
Looks like clothes...

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,600
Yeah I could only-

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Look, a plane!

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,560
Hey! That's some good quality metal!

129
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,040
I said they were made of good quality metal.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
You're saying that to a Boeing?

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,400
It's common sense!
You're saying that to a Boeing?

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
It's common sense!

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,720
Here

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,240
Beef jerky.

135
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
It's open!

136
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
Excuse me...

137
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,760
Everyone got a present but me...

138
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,120
You get no present, because of your father!

139
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,880
This is from Hakone...
(A town, 1 hour away by train.)

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
It's time to begin-

141
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,040
Another plane!

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey...

143
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,400
Hamada, you try.

144
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,360
Hurry! It's going away!

145
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
Hamada-kun!...

146
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
It's leaving!

147
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,560
It's gone...
It's leaving!

148
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
It's gone...

149
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
It's gone...

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,960
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

151
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,520
I was caught by it's beauty.

152
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
Another one will come.

153
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
It's not a big deal.

154
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,000
First, a pilot must build up the courage to fly.

155
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
What is a pilot?

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
What is a pilot?

157
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,800
What did humans want to be in the past?

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,920
Tanaka...

159
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,200
What did they want to become?

160
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,520
They wanted to fly, like birds.

161
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:32,120
~People might have been birds in the past~

162
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
See? The singer says it all.

163
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,720
Whether or not we were birds...

164
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,520
Another Plane!

165
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Tanaka!

166
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
Here's your chance!

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Say something.

168
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,520
It's leaving, again!

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,330
Tanaka, you let it get away!

170
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm sorry, was distracted by the size.

171
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't you have any feeling to shout?

172
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
(He said "Narita".)
Don't you have any feeling to shout?

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,600
(He said "Narita".)

174
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
[Narita = Tokyo's International Airport]

175
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,920
Huh?
[Narita = Tokyo's International Airport]

176
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,040
[Narita = Tokyo's International Airport]

177
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
He made a pun, right?

178
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I did that on purpose.

179
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,000
It's all planned comedy...

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,920
They call it, "Micro-Comedy".

181
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Next, begins the practical training of being a pilot.

182
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Let's go!

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,560
Bring that over here.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,560
Bring that machine here.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,360
This looks amazing.

186
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,520
What is that?

187
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,640
This is a prototype for a future plane.

188
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,200
This is a plane, and at the same time, it isn't.

189
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,640
It's about 70% finished...

190
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,000
...But it can fly.

191
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,560
In 3 years when this hits the markets...

192
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,720
Pilots and even civilians will be riding these.

193
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,640
Then why are we training to be pilots?

194
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Remember, it's still 3 years away...

195
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Shall we give it a whirl?

196
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
First, Shoji demonstrates for the pilots in training.

197
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
What will happen?

198
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
This is really easy.

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,280
It's probably not a good idea to use this in your house.

200
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,920
You have to ask someone nicely to help lift you up.

201
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,600
You have to be popular to use this thing.

202
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm taking off.

203
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,640
That looks scary.

204
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,640
Let's just go home.

205
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,680
This is getting ridiculous.

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,400
That looks weird.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What is he doing?

208
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,480
how far is he going?

209
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,760
That machine looks really heavy.

210
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,680
He's about to fall down.

211
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
He's going really far.

212
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,480
That thing can't fly.

213
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,080
He looks depressed.

214
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,440
Looks tough...

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,160
Yeah, he looks tired.

216
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,640
I thinks it's about 40 years...

217
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
3 years...

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Is not enough...

219
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,320
Matsumoto, would you give it a try?

220
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,040
Let's become birds.

221
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,000
Use this trigger to accelerate.

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,600
Don't press it too hard, or you'll fly away.

223
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,920
Give it a try now.

224
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Slowly press it.

225
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,720
Good Luck!

226
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Looks tough on the feet.

227
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,840
It's really heavy!

228
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,080
Looking good!

229
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,080
You'll see when he comes back...

230
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,320
He'll talk of how beautiful the sky is up there.

231
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,840
I bet he'll say it.

232
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,240
Matsumoto-kun, come back!

233
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,320
He's making a new face.

234
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Matsumoto-kun!

235
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,920
How was it?

236
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
It was...

237
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,920
Beautiful...

238
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
The sky is beautiful...

239
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,040
Did he fly?

240
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,920
I didn't think it would be this much leg work.

241
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,800
Matsumoto-kun!

242
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,480
You don't like to fly?

243
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,320
That's not what I meant.

244
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,840
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,560
In this next practice...

246
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,280
...We'll be flying real airplanes.

247
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,680
What??
...We'll be flying real airplanes.

248
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,080
What??

249
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,960
Real ones.

250
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,480
In the next training, they will learn how to maneuver in the sky.

251
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,840
Here they are.

252
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,400
These planes belong to "Air Doon".

253
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,400
AIR DOON!

254
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,320
Air Doon...

255
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,880
First up, Hamada-kun & Endo-kun.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Get over here.

257
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,720
Do you understand?

258
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,360
Yes.
Do you understand?

259
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes.

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,440
You see those cones over there?

261
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,760
These are enemy planes.

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,520
Enemy planes?

263
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,800
Enemy planes.
Enemy planes?

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,760
Enemy planes.

265
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,280
These are the other pilots around you, not just cones.

266
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,840
Hamada-kun, go ahead.

267
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's all become pilots! Let's all become pilots together!

268
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,120
Starting from here.

269
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
This thing tilts like crazy!

270
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:04,960
It's a plane! Of course it will tilt!
This thing tilts like crazy!

271
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,320
It's a plane! Of course it will tilt!

272
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,400
Find the center of gravity.
It's a plane! Of course it will tilt!

273
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,360
Find the center of gravity.

274
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,600
I see. That's what makes it difficult.
Find the center of gravity.

275
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,280
I see. That's what makes it difficult.

276
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,360
Climb up the ramp!

277
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,360
He didn't climb it properly...

278
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,000
Hamada! You didn't climb it properly!

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
He didn't use the small bar...

280
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,880
It's okay if your slow, just don't hit any cones.

281
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,600
Only 200 more times to go.

282
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,960
Don't fall until you finish 200 laps.

283
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,960
Captain, this part is really hard.

284
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,960
Of course it's not easy...

285
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,840
You're flying!

286
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
It's too hard...

287
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,880
Who said you could take a break?

288
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,160
Why did you stop?

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,560
I never told you to stop.

290
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,840
No good... Sorry.

291
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,440
There is a proper runway line that you need to be using.

292
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
You aren't flying properly on that line.

293
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
It's really hard, captain...

294
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,400
You said that you wanted this, instead of the paper exam.

295
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,200
You said this is what you wanted.

296
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Matsumoto-kun!

297
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,960
That one.

298
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,160
Let's-

299
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
HEY!

300
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
Hamada-kun!...

301
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,280
You're hitting the cones!

302
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,880
Sorry!

303
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,160
You think this is just a bicycle, don't you?

304
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,840
No!

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
THEN FOLLOW THE RULES!

306
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,760
Follow the rules!

307
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,720
I'm sorry!

308
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,200
You really think this is just a bicylcle!

309
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,480
They're planes, you guys!

310
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,800
Sorry.
They're planes, you guys!

311
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,320
Sorry.

312
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,160
Are you taking this seriously?!

313
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,570
The sky feels amazing, doesn't it?

314
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,560
I think this thing is broken.

315
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,040
Let's all fly to China.

316
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,840
We'll stop at China.

317
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,560
Carefully!

318
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,760
Something might come popping out of these cones.

319
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,680
Captain!

320
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,360
Are you alright?

321
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,080
Are you hurt?

322
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,840
You need medical assistance.

323
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,360
There's blood coming out.

324
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
No. No. I'm fine.

325
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
It's not blood.

326
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,280
It wasn't blood.

327
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,760
So, what was it?

328
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,040
Fish oil...

329
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,280
Just fish oil...

330
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,800
You don't think I'm lying, do you?

331
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
Sorry. You're right.
You don't think I'm lying, do you?

332
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
Sorry. You're right.

333
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,080
You all did well...

334
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,360
...Much better than group 5...

335
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,880
...Group 6.

336
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,320
We're group 6?

337
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,080
You guys have much more talent than group 5.

338
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
So we're group 6?

339
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,520
Yes, you are.
So we're group 6?

340
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,240
Yes, you are.

341
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,040
Let's go take a break.

342
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Let's take a water break.

343
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,040
I'm so thirsty...

344
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah, because it's so hot today.

345
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,880
Thank you, very much.

346
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,840
It's cold.

347
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,200
Is it good?

348
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,440
Chief...

349
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
...Captain...

350
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,720
...I would like some tea.

351
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm so thirsty.

352
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,600
You should try sipping it from the ground.

353
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,720
I remember that day well...

354
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
...With that 40-year-old woman...

355
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,520
She had 2 kids.

356
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,480
You asked me, "Why don't you get married already?"

357
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
What the hell was up with that phone call?

358
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,960
You never call me!

359
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,000
To my surprise, it was you.

360
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,720
I found out the truth...

361
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,320
In a nearby snack bar,

362
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,400
That woman was sitting there...

363
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,200
She had 2 kids... She was 40 years old...

364
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,880
That's when you called and asked...

365
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
"Why don't you get married already?"

366
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
What do you mean get married?!

367
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,400
She sent me a text message saying that she liked you.

368
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,480
I called her and do you know what she said?

369
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,220
She said there was no way it would work out.

370
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,000
She called the night after...

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,120
...Apologizing for how drunk she was.

372
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,800
She said, "Erase my number, I was only drunk."

373
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,320
Did that really happen?

374
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
You made me look bad, you idiot!

375
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,520
The next course will teach how a pilot should deal with a hijacking on the plane.

376
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,520
Now, what should you do when someone is trying to hijack the plane?

377
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,160
This here, is the key to an airplane.

378
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,520
If a hijacker breaks into the cabin and steals the key...

379
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,040
...Then the plane will stop moving.

380
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,200
It's your job to make sure they don't steal the key.

381
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,120
When someone tries to hijack a plane, do they usually go for the key?

382
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
Does that really happen?

383
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,160
So, if a hijacker pulls the key out of the ignition.

384
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,520

385

-untranslated-

388
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,800
A hijacker might try to take the key, so let's practice stopping them.

389
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,960
If you're able to stop them today, I'll recommend you as a pilot.

390
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll be the hijacker.

391
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
I'll do it.

392
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,240
Count to 10.

393
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,480
1...

394
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
2...

395
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,640
3...

396
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,760
4...

397
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
5...

398
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,800
6...

399
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,880
7...

400
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
8...

401
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
9...

402
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,840
10...

403
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,480
He's running really fast.

404
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
I didn't know you could run like that.

405
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,120
What a weird way to run.
I didn't know you could run like that.

406
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,200
What a weird way to run.

407
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,400
Come get me!

408
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
(Let's go home...)
Come get me!

409
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,560
(Let's go home...)

410
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:31,680
Come on!
(Let's go home...)

411
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,920
Come on!

412
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,960
Man, being a pilot was tough.

413
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
It was really tough.

414
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,320
What about the flying machines?

415
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,800
I still have the key!
