1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,600
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
All the Girls gather.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,520
Degawa Girls Gathering Special.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,480
One day,
we visit Madame at her home.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,160
This time is the fifth popular
Degawa Girls Gathering.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,640
Yeah? It's popular? Really?

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Madame will decide the programme
of the girls gathering.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,720
Let me think...

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,320
We made pottery the other day,
didn't we?

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,040
So how about doing glass art
this time?

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,160
But the pottery I made that time

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,040
wasn't displayed at the studio.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,040
I made so much effort to make it,
why don't you show it today?

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,400
She's angry.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,600
Make sure you show it this time.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,040
Their journey will mainly be
in Saga Prefecture

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,480
where glass art thrives,

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,880
and will also go to hot springs
as Madame wishes,

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,840
and travel around Oita Prefecture,
all in this journey.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,840
Also, starting this time...

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,360
- New girl, Yokota will join.
- That's right.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,400
It was tough enough
when Yumeppe joined the other day.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,240
If Yokota also joins,

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,960
there'll be trouble again.

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,240
Does Madame know Yokota joined?

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
- We've told her.
- You have?

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,800
What did you say?

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,200
A new girl called Yokota
will come this time.

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,160
Is that so? Why don't you
reduce the number a bit?

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,800
Mayuko will leave first.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,480
What will the girls' gathering
this time be like?

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,160
Welcome to The Quest.

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,560
Today's programme is
Degawa Girls Gathering Special.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,560
Wasshoi!

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,600
"Morisanchu"

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,560
Hello...

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,600
Hello!

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,600
Hello, everyone!

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,560
"Madame Dewi"

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,560
"Mayuko Kawakita, Akane Hotta"

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,600
"Yumena Yanai, Mayuu Yokota"

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,720
Mr Advisor, it's an hour
of girls gathering again?

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
One hour.

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Thank you.

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,800
We're really happy,

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,760
but Madame said if
a new Degawa Girl joins,

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,520
- one old girl can go.
- Yes.

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,080
If we get one new student,
one should graduate.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
New student...

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
We must let them graduate.

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
At first, Degawa Girls were young,
I thought it was nice and new,

52
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,240
but when the two young girls joined,
they suddenly looked old.

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,320
It's not fresh at all.

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,280
We're young! We're very young!

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,480
Yokota, it's the first time
you joined, right?

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,040
- Yes.
- How was it?

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,480
I had a lot of fun.

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,600
I went to steal the skills
of the older girls.

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
"Older girls..."

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,160
The three old girls
are in white costumes here.

61
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,640
It's not white costume!

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,960
Why? Why?

63
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,640
Like they're prepared to die
to do something.

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
It's fresh!

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
Saga!

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,800
Impressive!

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Ow... hot...

68
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,720
It's difficult.

69
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Ms Kawakita, do it again.

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,480
- "Yay!"
- It's horrible!

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
"Degawa Girls' Gathering
in Saga, Oita"

73
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,960
900 kilometres from Tokyo,

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,800
two new girls will also join.

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,200
Degawa Girls' Gathering
in Saga, Oita.

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
We've come to...

77
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,280
Saga!

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,480
This is Saga Castle History Museum.

79
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,840
The first iron cannon in Japan
was manufactured here,

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,440
it's also known to have led
the Meiji Restoration.

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Madame, we have
another new Degawa Girl join--

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,560
Dewi Girls.

83
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Yes, Dewi Girls.

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,160
Yokota, introduce yourself.

85
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm Mayuu Yokota, nice to meet you.

86
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm 21 years old.
Please call me Yokota.

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,440
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,080
- Did you apply for it?
- She's not interested!

89
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,120
I went to the same audition
with Yumeppe.

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,960
That means you were the first place
and you were the second place?

91
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
"1st place, 2nd place"

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,600
We were supposed to join together.

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,880
Don't make things awkward!

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,600
- Why do you stand like this anyway?
- No idea.

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,520
But somehow it feels like
the two of them were demoted.

96
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
That's so mean!

97
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's start
the Degawa Girls Gathering.

98
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,560
First, it's the glass art
Madame would like to do.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
It's said that
glass was first introduced to Japan

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
in the Yayoi period,

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,400
but manufacturing of glassware
started in the Edo period,

102
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
in full swing.

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,360
This time, they'll learn it
at Soejima Glassware,

104
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,840
which was founded in 1903.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,440
Who will teach us?

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,400
It's him.

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,840
- Oh, he's our teacher?
- Yes.

108
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
What about you, sir?

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
I'm only going to watch.

110
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
Only watch?

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,680
Oh? Are you from the neighbourhood?

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
- The company's president, right?
- What?

113
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,960
He doesn't look like a president.

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,000
He totally does! His skin is fair.

115
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,840
What kind of glassware do you make?

116
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,000
It's called Hizen Vidro,

117
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
it's Saga's traditional glassware.

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,640
Saga's important intangible
cultural asset, Hizen Vidro.

119
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,280
"Vidro" means "glass" in Portuguese.

120
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,560
It is made by glassblowing,
without using any mould.

121
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,640
To shape the glassware,

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
crafters use gravitational force
and centrifugal force well.

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
It is difficult,

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
but no two pieces of glassware
are the same.

125
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,280
It's made into glassware that has
a warmth unique to handmade work.

126
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,920
This time, they'll learn from
the teacher for two days,

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
and make their own unique glassware.

128
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,240
Madame will make a champagne glass.

129
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,800
Now this part of a champagne glass
is narrower,

130
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
it's become the mainstream.

131
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
On the other hand,
the youngest Yumeppe...

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
Like this.

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
I'll make a vase for my grandma.

134
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
How wonderful that is!

135
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,640
- My grandma loves flowers.
- What, Ms Kawakita?

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,520
- I'll make a glass for my grandma.
- Shut up!

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,440
Stop it!

138
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,960
And Degawa...

139
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,560
What's that?

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,000
- Liar!
- I'm scared!

141
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,800
You've never bought your wife
souvenirs,

142
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
why do you do this?

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,280
This isn't right!

144
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,640
Day one is the beginner's course.

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,800
No matter what glassware it is,
the first thing they do is Tamatori.

146
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,960
The glass is melted into
a syrupy-state in the furnace,

147
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
it's rolled around
the tip of a stick.

148
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,920
The small ball has a diameter
of three centimetres.

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
Blow air into it little by little,

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
and the ball that forms the base
is done.

151
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
This is the core.

152
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,360
We'll put another layer of glass
on top,

153
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,160
and make it expand.

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
Madame tries it first.

155
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,160
Can she wrap a small ball around it,
like the teacher?

156
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,720
Madame, isn't it fast?

157
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
She secured 10 times the amount
of the teacher's.

158
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,160
She blows air into it,
but it doesn't' move at all.

159
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
It's difficult.

160
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,560
Actually, this looks easy,

161
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,240
but it takes three years
to master the skill.

162
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
Good...

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Degawa is doing it quite well.

164
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,840
He'll shape the glass now.

165
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,280
Turn it...

166
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,880
Good!

167
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,440
- Good...
- Ow... hot...

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
- Good...
- Wow!

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
It's hot!

170
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,320
Compete with time.

171
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,280
- Hurry, hurry!
- Hurry up!

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
You can't do it at all.

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
He didn't make that sound.

174
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,800
Anyway, I was surprised!

175
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,400
This isn't hot at all.

176
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,440
But you said it was hot.

177
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,880
To make it expand,

178
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,760
they need to wrap the glass
around the part

179
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,160
further from the tip,
like the teacher did.

180
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,080
Yumeppe showed the difference.

181
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,960
- Wow!
- Yumeppe!

182
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,160
New girl Yokota successfully
expanded it.

183
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
I made it!

184
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,960
Our new Degawa Girls are amazing!

185
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,680
What is it?
Maybe their breaths are fresher?

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,880
All the members still need practise,

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,920
so we'll show you the craftsman's
wonderful techniques.

188
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,800
The glass expands to the ideal size,

189
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,800
it's moved to another stick,

190
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,760
and it's cut away
from the original stick.

191
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,840
It's difficult.

192
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,160
The hole opened here will become
the mouth of the cup or the glass.

193
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,840
Expand it according to what
you want to make, and it's done.

194
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,640
In the case of making a plate...

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
It's impressive.

196
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,840
Centrifugal force.

197
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,840
It's finished by using
centrifugal force,

198
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,680
and this is the finished glass art.

199
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,040
The thing that can only be made
using the technique here in Japan

200
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,560
is this blue saké warmer.

201
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,040
It is done by using two sticks
together at the same time.

202
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,960
Blow into one stick,

203
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,840
and stretch the part of the mouth
using the other stick.

204
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
- That's difficult.
- Wow!

205
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,880
It doesn't break?

206
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,600
When the glass sets,
use gravitational force to shape it.

207
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
In Japan,

208
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,760
it's a traditional technique that's
only passed down in Hizen Vidor.

209
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
At the same time, the amateurs...

210
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,760
He's so noisy.

211
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,160
Wow, it isn't hot at all.

212
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
What was that, then?

213
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,240
The teacher's wife
is a rather good teacher.

214
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,960
She lets him do a little,

215
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
but basically, she does it together.

216
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,600
On the other hand,
Mr Fujii is a craftsman,

217
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,800
he never spoils his students.

218
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,720
That's how far it can get.
Mr Fujii, have a look.

219
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
Take it out.

220
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,760
- How is it?
- Hurry up.

221
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,960
It'd take 10 minutes to finish
if he helps,

222
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
but she spent 50 whole minutes

223
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,200
to heat and mould the glass,
repeatedly.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,280
Her face is already oily.

225
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,320
He doesn't change
his educational principle

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,600
for Madame, either.

227
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,800
You dropped it with a thump.

228
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,480
We aren't going to become experts
of glass art.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Among them, the talented one
is new girl Yokota.

230
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,640
Only a few people can be this good.

231
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,800
The way she spins the stick
is logical.

232
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,560
The president suddenly appeared,

233
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
and praised the way
she turns the stick.

234
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,240
It is turned stably,
so gravitational force acts equally,

235
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
and it's kept as a beautiful sphere.

236
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
I have potential.

237
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,280
She has potential? Teacher!

238
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
She has potential.

239
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,960
You never said that to me!
I turned it 30--

240
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
On the other hand,
the one who has no talent

241
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,680
but made her presence felt,
is old girl Tani.

242
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,240
- It's hot!
- Oh, watch out!

243
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Stop it!

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,880
Self-claimed burn.

245
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,600
Four people are looking after you
for your burn. What the heck?

246
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,720
Hey, Maria!

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
It hurts!

248
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,640
It's a tiny burn and you need
four adults to look after you?

249
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,560
It hurts!

250
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,760
Are you okay with that?

251
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,640
And Yumeppe...

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,040
She doesn't think about
being filmed at all,

253
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,840
and she's making effort
for her grandma...

254
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,920
That's the look on her face when she
makes something for her grandma.

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,600
But Yumeppe is also thinking
about various things.

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
Is there anything you want to learn
from the senior girls?

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,960
Like their reaction,

258
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,600
the way they fawn on the crew.

259
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
I mean Maria's burn
was nothing serious, right?

260
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,680
That's what I think,

261
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,120
but that's what Maria does
to gain her time on the show.

262
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,360
It's how each person
competes for exposure.

263
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,560
Day one ends with knowing
how difficult glass art is.

264
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,600
They'll go to film in Oita now.

265
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
Excuse me, may I ask something?

266
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,320
May I go home?

267
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,600
May you go home? That's new!

268
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,040
I'll return to Tokyo
to shoot a movie.

269
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,480
- Shoot a movie?
- Yes.

270
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
This is bad...

271
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,120
Which job actually came first
in your schedule?

272
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,360
- The movie.
- Oh... The movie.

273
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,840
We must let her leave, then,
if that came first.

274
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,200
That makes me feel frustrated,
though.

275
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,800
So Yokota
will join them again later.

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,880
Now it's the tour in Oita.

277
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,360
First, it's a popular local show.

278
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,600
They've come to an aquarium in Oita,
Umitamago.

279
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
The show is...

280
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,720
a walrus performance.

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
It's about 20 kilograms.

282
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,800
"Female walrus Michan"

283
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,960
She's so cute!

284
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,040
She looks like you!
She looks like Tetsuro.

285
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,480
- She doesn't!
- Yes, she does.

286
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,640
Do you two look alike?

287
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
Michan is prettier, right?

288
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,520
Michan is a surprisingly
skilled performer.

289
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,200
- She'll whistle.
- Whistle?

290
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,240
Let's do it.

291
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,720
- No way!
- Really?

292
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,760
- She's good at it!
- It's true.

293
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,040
It was perfect!

294
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,680
She can even distinguish
words of the human language.

295
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,840
Wait. Suck!

296
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,080
It was perfect!

297
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
She's so clever!

298
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,960
The last performance
is the powerful technique,

299
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
watermelon splitting.

300
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,080
I'd like someone to wear this.

301
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,200
If you've prepared a watermelon,
then I have to wear it.

302
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Did you wear something like that
to ride a bicycle?

303
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,120
It's scary!

304
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
Don't move.

305
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,600
Wait... It's the first time
I perform with a walrus!

306
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,120
Will Michan be able to
burst the balloon successfully?

307
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,760
Let's do it!

308
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,080
Ready, go!

309
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,080
Hit!

310
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Ouch!

311
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Michan... Michan,
that was my shoulder!

312
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,520
Michan, I must thank you,
in a way.

313
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,160
Thanks, Michan.

314
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,320
One more makes his appearance.

315
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
He's huge!

316
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,640
He's bigger than Michan!

317
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Weighing about one tonne,
this is male sea lion, Gentaro.

318
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,680
He loves fish.

319
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,200
Gen! Gen!

320
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll throw it.

321
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,920
From there?

322
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,680
His special trick is fish catching.

323
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,320
He can catch the fish
no matter where I throw it from.

324
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,920
The distance is 30 metres.

325
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
Ready, go!

326
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
Catch it!

327
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,480
That's impressive!

328
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,880
As they've realised,
it's the caretaker Mr Sawada

329
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
who does the impressive trick,
but...

330
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,200
Gen, I'll throw!

331
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,440
That's our Degawa Girls for you.

332
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,320
They do it successfully
one after next at 15 metres.

333
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm impressed by them.

334
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,480
I'll try that.

335
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,880
81-year-old Madame will try it too.

336
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,120
And Madame caused a miracle.

337
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,840
Gen!

338
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
A miraculous zero metres.

339
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Wonderful!

340
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Can it be funnier?

341
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
That's Madame for you.

342
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,320
Madame and Degawa will try to
perform in the walrus performance.

343
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,880
Will they do it well?

344
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,680
Okay, come.

345
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,560
He's gentle.

346
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,120
Come, Michan.

347
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,480
He feeds Michan too often
and they enter too slowly.

348
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,520
- Come, Michan.
- He feeds her so much!

349
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,120
Now, Degawa and Dewi's

350
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,720
walrus performance
is going to start.

351
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
A round of applause, please.

352
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,120
A round of applause.

353
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,040
The first performance
will be sit-ups.

354
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,760
- Yumeppe, please come here.
- Yes!

355
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,040
- Please hold her legs down.
- Her legs?

356
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Tummy!

357
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,400
- They're her legs.
- Okay.

358
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay,

359
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,320
sit up!

360
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,280
- Wow!
- Once more!

361
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Sit up!

362
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,720
Next, it's a prank
played on the girls.

363
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,840
She's thirsty,
so let's give her some water.

364
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,400
- Wait.
- You give her too many fish.

365
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,880
Okay, water. Okay.

366
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,600
Okay, suck...

367
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,000
Spit.

368
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,240
Suck...

369
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
- Spit.
- Wow!

370
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,560
Suck!

371
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,520
Spit!

372
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,280
Madame is delighted.

373
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,080
And lastly...

374
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,680
Michan has a wonderful present
for you.

375
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,280
- We'll give it to Akane.
- Why?

376
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
- Akane, please come here.
- Okay.

377
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,920
This wonderful present is a kiss!

378
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,000
A kiss from the walrus,

379
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,920
it's Madame's
thoughtful arrangement.

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,040
Close your eyes.
Her whiskers are hard.

381
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,760
Do I need to close my eyes?

382
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, come...

383
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,160
Kiss!

384
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,720
Not yet...

385
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,200
Kiss!

386
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,320
Kiss!

387
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,560
You haven't kissed anyone lately,
right?

388
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,120
No, I haven't! Thank you!

389
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,480
Attention!

390
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
Bow!

391
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,320
Thank you! A round of applause!

392
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,280
Wonderful!

393
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,360
Teacher, how did they do?

394
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,800
They got full marks.

395
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
- Wow!
- I was impressed.

396
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,600
Are you crying, Teacher?

397
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,960
Teacher, why?

398
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,320
Why? Why, Teacher?

399
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,040
Mr Degawa and Madame were brilliant,

400
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
Michan did so well too...

401
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,000
The mystery of the teacher's tears.

402
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,280
The mystery of
the second person's tears.

403
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,960
Where will they stay tonight?

404
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
- What?
- Whoa...

405
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
It's impressive.

406
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,080
Large resort hotel in Beppu City,

407
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,640
Suginoi Hotel.

408
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,280
There's a buffet restaurant
that serves over 80 dishes,

409
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,720
and an outdoor hot spring
where you can enjoy a fountain show.

410
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,320
It's full of entertainment
besides the stay.

411
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,560
The room they'll stay at is...

412
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,720
Isn't this wonderful?

413
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,400
It's the Hermitage Suite Room.

414
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
The cost of one night
starts from 56,000 yen.

415
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,680
But they can't stay at this room
that easily.

416
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,840
Only the people who win the game
can stay.

417
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,520
- I knew it.
- Again!

418
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,280
Let's do it. The room goes down
four ranks if they lose,

419
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,280
Hotel Death Match.

420
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
Whoa, here it is.

421
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,640
They'll do our familiar
target hitting water game.

422
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,800
That one?

423
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,640
The first round
is between two fresh girls.

424
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,920
Yumeppe versus Yokota,
who is back from her movie shooting.

425
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,560
Mayuu used to play softball.

426
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,480
But you play baseball
with your younger brother.

427
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
Yes, I do...

428
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,920
The rock, paper, scissors to decide
who goes first will be the key.

429
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Rock, paper, scissors!

430
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,240
Yay!

431
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,480
The way you rejoice is young!

432
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,680
Yay!

433
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,960
- That's awful. Do it once more.
- Yay!

434
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,000
- That's awful!
- Yay!

435
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
You have a new gag.

436
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,840
You have a new gag.

437
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,160
Former softball team member Yokota
goes first.

438
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,400
It's quite far away.

439
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes!

440
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,520
You totally missed it.

441
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,080
She's got the powerful vibes,
like she could do it,

442
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,480
but she couldn't at all.

443
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,000
Basically,

444
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
Yokota is disappointing.

445
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,760
Yumeppe goes next.

446
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,440
Oh, I can't!

447
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,040
It doesn't hit at all!

448
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
I can't do it.

449
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,920
The moment she threw,
"Oh, I can't do it!"

450
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
"I can't do it."

451
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,840
Don't show that look on TV.

452
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,440
Next, Yokota disappointed again.

453
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,480
- Yokota! So poor!
- That was poor.

454
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,720
And then...

455
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,760
She did it...

456
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,800
Yokota is defeated miserably.

457
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,840
It was long.

458
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,360
It looks like an "M."

459
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,520
Take away your hands.

460
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm sorry!

461
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,240
Look this way. This way.

462
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,560
That's long.

463
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,720
Next, a match between old girls
Hotta versus Tani.

464
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
Hotta goes first.

465
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,280
Say everything on your mind
before you throw, then throw it.

466
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,040
- Maria.
- Yes?

467
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,080
Will you not switch off your mind
in the middle of a conversation?

468
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,680
It's because what you say is boring.

469
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,080
Shut up.

470
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,280
Good! Good!

471
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,760
The first throw.

472
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,640
So close! That was so close!

473
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
Change of offence and defence.

474
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,880
- I'll throw.
- I'm scared!

475
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,680
So close!

476
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,640
So close!

477
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,160
It was so close!

478
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
The distance is shorter,
it's Hotta's chance.

479
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
I'll throw.

480
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
Tani is defeated.

481
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
It's long!

482
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,200
So long!

483
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,640
It doesn't stop.

484
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,240
That's an old girl for you.

485
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,880
She's even used to the way
to let water pour over her.

486
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm impressed.

487
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,080
Wasn't that long?

488
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm soaking wet!

489
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,360
Lastly, a match between the queens,

490
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,320
Madame versus Kawakita.

491
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
That was dirty!

492
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
Yes! Yes! Yes!

493
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,040
You played dirty!

494
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,520
You'll surely win!

495
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,760
You make a fool of me like that,

496
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
are you sure? Is it okay?

497
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,200
- It's started.
- Yes.

498
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,000
We hoped for Madame's miracle
for a moment, but...

499
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,040
Can she do it? Go!

500
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,320
That was close...

501
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,440
It's almost a rerun
of the clip just now.

502
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
And then...

503
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,840
I'll throw.

504
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,920
Don't.

505
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,840
Don't!

506
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,040
It's the true ability
of the 81-year-old

507
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,680
that exceeds the two girls before.

508
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,040
Are you kidding me?

509
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
You stuck your head there?

510
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,320
It's Madame's shower time.

511
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
It was a sexy shower scene.

512
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,040
Degawa Girls Gathering
will continue,

513
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,760
but we'll be back at the studio
for now.

514
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,000
What do you think, Miyagawa?

515
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,560
What I think Yokota
has room for improvement

516
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,760
is her reaction
when water poured on her.

517
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,640
Maria used the water pressure

518
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,200
to separate her fringe,
so that her face was visible.

519
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
Without getting too calculating.

520
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
- That's right.
- Make it just right.

521
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,160
I was impressed by her.

522
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,400
Madame even used the water that
poured down in front as a shower.

523
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,760
Impressive.

524
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,680
She put it back.

525
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
What about you, Imoto?

526
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,520
She was burnt so badly,
would anyone not get worried?

527
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,840
Indeed.

528
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
But in Yumeppe's eyes,

529
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,360
that was Maria Tani's time.

530
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,120
Everyone gains exposure
in different ways.

531
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,080
No, it wasn't on purpose.

532
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,600
Do you want to learn
how to make time for exposure?

533
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,400
I thought each person did it
in their own way.

534
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,440
Don't say we do it!

535
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,560
I didn't care about how much time
I had in a show when I was 21.

536
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,440
Making of Hizen Vidro for real.

537
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,560
After practising for two whole days,

538
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
the shapes of their glassware
are getting better bit by bit.

539
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
- Wow!
- Yokota is good at it.

540
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Yumeppe is making a vase.

541
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,840
She rolls the coloured glass beads
around

542
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,200
to create a pattern.

543
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Roast it over the fire
to blend them in,

544
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,800
and blow it into a narrow,
long shape of a vase.

545
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,560
- So beautiful!
- It's beautiful!

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
When it's cooled,

547
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,520
the colour becomes vivid,
as you can see.

548
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,720
After the mouth is opened,
it's almost finished.

549
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Won't it be cute
if the mouth is at an angle?

550
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Yes, it's cute.

551
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,760
On the other hand, Degawa...

552
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,240
Come here, please.

553
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,160
What did you do yesterday?

554
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,040
He doesn't even know
how to put it here!

555
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,360
He relied on Mrs Fujii's
gentle teaching on day one,

556
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,680
and he doesn't remember anything.

557
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,800
Oh, I need to keep turning it?

558
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,960
Hey...

559
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,880
- It's the most basic thing!
- Where were you looking yesterday?

560
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,080
Mayuko did this
about 40 times yesterday.

561
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,840
He aims to make
a heart-shaped plate.

562
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,560
He expands the mouth widely,

563
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,280
heats it to make it soft
and shape it.

564
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
It's beautiful.

565
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
Thank you for making me
delicious food every day!

566
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,720
If he also pulls
the opposite side...

567
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,720
Wonderful!

568
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
80 percent was due
to the teacher's help,

569
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,600
it turns into
a beautiful heart shape.

570
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,760
- You made it.
- It's pretty!

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,560
Everyone will finish their work
at this stage.

572
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Yokota will use coloured glass
to highlight the saké glass' rim.

573
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
This is how you do it?

574
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
- Beautiful!
- Nice!

575
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,160
She's good at it.

576
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,280
Tani will highlight
her single-flower vase.

577
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,040
She turns the vase
and applies force,

578
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,160
and makes a twisted pattern on it.

579
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,120
Among them,
Hotta is struggling alone.

580
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,680
- What? Why?
- Oh, it's crushed!

581
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,560
It bumped into the furnace's wall
and is crushed.

582
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,520
From scratch?

583
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,840
What?

584
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,720
The shape is finally formed, but...

585
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
A bowl for somen noodles?

586
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,840
It's not at all.

587
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,800
We'll put it in the rubbish bin...

588
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,600
The teacher called it rubbish!

589
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,080
Teacher, wait! Wait...

590
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,600
And Madame...

591
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,520
She is certainly improving
after a lot of practise.

592
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,680
She is obviously
handling the glass well, too.

593
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,000
But when she is finishing it,

594
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,240
things gradually changed.

595
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,400
When you put a red line in
yesterday,

596
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,840
you added a lot, right?

597
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,720
Don't make it like that.

598
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,920
Don't add a lot of red at once,

599
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,840
please just add a little.

600
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,520
Can I do it?

601
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,520
Yeah...

602
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,040
She gives instructions
more than doing it herself.

603
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Madame, do it yourself.

604
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,280
"Ho ho ho ho ho"

605
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,560
We make it together.

606
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
The glassware will cool
and be done two days later,

607
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
we'll show you the glassware
at the second part.

608
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
I'm looking forward to it.

609
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,240
We'll go to Oita again
for an activity in scenic nature.

610
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,240
They filmed a lot.

611
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,240
We have the help of our guide,
Mr Tanaka.

612
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,440
You'll go to a river
called Yufugawa Canyon.

613
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,920
- Wonderful! I love it.
- A river!

614
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Yufugawa Canyon.

615
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,760
It's a river that flows
at the bottom of steep cliffs

616
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,720
that are 15 to 60 metres high.

617
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,960
It's dangerous,

618
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,560
so you couldn't go to the back
of a canoe till recently.

619
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,760
This packraft is light,

620
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,160
we've introduced it,

621
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,920
so we can go to places
we haven't been able to before.

622
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,960
This is an activity that started
in May, 2021,

623
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,760
we are the first group of
common people to use it,

624
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,640
so there's a bit of fear.

625
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,360
Can we really go in there?

626
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,840
First, they go down the difficult
mountain path to the river.

627
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Oh! I'm sorry.

628
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,720
- There she goes again.
- I'm sorry.

629
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,520
Don't do that!

630
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
I really hate her scream.

631
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,160
Mayuko, I really hate your scream.

632
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,480
Before Yumeppe went down,
she texted her mum.

633
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
She's adorable.

634
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,800
She said she'd go and do her best.

635
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,560
You guys haven't talked to your mums
for two, three years, right?

636
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,240
That's not right...

637
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,240
15 minutes after they started,

638
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
they're at the entrance
of the canyon.

639
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,200
We'll go upstream in the river.

640
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
The further back we go,

641
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
- the narrower the river gets.
- It looks powerful!

642
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,680
Their destination
is three hours away.

643
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,160
The width between precipitous cliffs
is only two metres,

644
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,800
it's a mysterious scene.

645
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,800
But only 30 seconds
after they get on the packraft...

646
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,080
We have to carry it already?

647
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,600
Carry it upstream, get on it.

648
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,120
We'll repeat the process
till we're there.

649
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,240
That's tough.

650
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,360
They'll carry
the two-kilogram packraft on land

651
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,840
and go forward,
then get on the raft.

652
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,400
It's a harsh journey
that repeats that.

653
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,840
It's fast!

654
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,520
It's fast! Not there yet?

655
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,680
The natural environment
waiting for them

656
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
is beyond their imagination.

657
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,240
They must cross many big rocks
to get there.

658
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
The boat is in the way!

659
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
What's this self-service?

660
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,520
But the one who goes forward
without any complaint

661
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,280
is the 81-year-old Madame.

662
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,720
She walks at the front
and even helps the young girls.

663
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,800
Impressive!

664
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,960
If Mr Degawa has a hard time
climbing up, please help him.

665
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,120
But this man is heavy.

666
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,480
But we're a team, Madame.

667
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,800
This difficult path

668
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,040
brings back the teamwork

669
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,240
the Girls Gathering members
usually lack.

670
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,200
Even the three old girls hold hands,
which they usually don't do,

671
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,720
when they go forward.

672
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,160
Ready, go!

673
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Okay!

674
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,040
Ready, go! Okay!

675
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,800
Ready, go! Okay!

676
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,400
Ready, go! Okay!

677
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
Are you an idiot?

678
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,080
They've been helping each other
in their journey for three hours.

679
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,920
Everyone, look up! Look!

680
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
Wow, it's beautiful!

681
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,120
- It's shining.
- Wonderful!

682
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,960
From now on,
it's the destination of the journey,

683
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,440
Oita Prefecture's famous spot,
Yufugawa Canyon's unexplored region.

684
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
Wow, it's beautiful!

685
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,080
The canyon is about
12 kilometres long,

686
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,720
there are over 40 waterfalls.

687
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,320
The beautiful scenery is called
Tyrol in the East.

688
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,920
When they go further back...

689
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,400
It's getting more like
Indiana Jones in real life.

690
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,160
It is the bottom of a great canyon
surrounded by precipitous cliffs.

691
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,880
It makes you wonder
what the usual unsightly dispute

692
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
of Degawa Girls' Gathering is.

693
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,480
It's so refreshing.

694
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,120
Let's stop the unsightly dispute.

695
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,920
- Let's stop.
- Let's stop.

696
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,880
Let's not compete for number one
or punish the others.

697
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,680
- Let's stop.
- Okay.

698
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,840
It's a mess.

699
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,960
But on their way back...

700
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,080
Hey, did you just push me?

701
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,360
I helped you go forward.

702
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,280
Hey, don't push.

703
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,080
Everyone shows their ego.

704
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Okay, let's go.

705
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,280
Madame and Degawa go to a hot spring
to heal their tired bodies.

706
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,920
Wow!

707
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,840
This is Suginoi Hotel's speciality,

708
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,760
an outdoor bath with a stunning view
that sees the whole Beppu City,

709
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,880
Tanayu.

710
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,160
This really is the bath
for the winner.

711
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
- Really.
- Wow!

712
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,800
Did Degawa Girls' Gathering change
after adding more members?

713
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,880
They talk like friends
when they are having lunch,

714
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
but they get competitive
when the camera starts filming.

715
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
At the same time,

716
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,240
the Girls have a gathering
under the new system.

717
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,280
Amazing!

718
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,960
They've come to

719
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,280
a glamping facility that opened
in April, 2021,

720
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,720
GRANXIA Beppu Kannawa.

721
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,880
You can see the whole view
from the dome-shaped rooms,

722
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,040
and they all have a hot spring.

723
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,200
Also, you can try
Beppu's speciality, Jigoku Mushi,

724
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,600
which uses geothermal power
to steam food ingredients.

725
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,480
It's a stylish spot
with every service you'd want.

726
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,760
Wow, the view!

727
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,920
What's this, really?

728
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,480
Wait, where's my bed?

729
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,680
Yokota, what do you think,
after becoming a Degawa Girl?

730
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
I enjoy it.

731
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,960
When Madame opens her eyes wide,
you'd better be really careful.

732
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
She knows that.

733
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,520
What about Mr Degawa?

734
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,400
I thought it was cute that
he does this when he speaks.

735
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,640
It's cute?

736
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,320
I've never noticed that,
but he really does that!

737
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,880
He'd say this and that.

738
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,800
He says this and that.

739
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,200
She said, "Again?"
and this and that.

740
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
"Show me the photo, then,"
and this and that.

741
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,440
- Maria grew up a lot.
- Really?

742
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,600
She grew up suddenly
after you two joined.

743
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,000
She grew up so much that
I wonder what she had been doing.

744
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,040
She changed.

745
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
- I'm impressed.
- I'm impressed.

746
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,960
Are you impressed by your seniors?

747
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,040
On the bus, I saw Senior Akane

748
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,920
reading a book called
"The Courage to Be Hated."

749
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,920
I thought, "I do need the courage
to be hated."

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,320
If you worry about
something on The Quest,

751
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,400
I really recommend that book.

752
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
They will show us the glassware
they've made.

753
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,600
They're done!

754
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,760
First, a saké glass made by Yokota,
the one who has most potential.

755
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,160
Ta-da!

756
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,040
- So pretty!
- Beautiful!

757
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,080
Isn't it pretty?

758
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,560
She rolled the coloured glass
on the rim of the glass herself,

759
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,400
it is a beautiful light blue.

760
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
It's not absolutely straight,

761
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,600
but it's also unique
to handmade glassware.

762
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,840
Next, it's Yumeppe's vase
she made for her grandma.

763
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,440
Ta-da!

764
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,640
It's a success!

765
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,640
But there's a crack here.

766
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,880
- There is!
- There's a crack...

767
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,280
Actually, when she removed it
from the stick at the last step,

768
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
it made a crack at the bottom,

769
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,800
but the shape and the colours
are really beautiful.

770
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,600
You can use as a decoration.

771
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,840
She can use it
if she doesn't fill it with water.

772
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,240
Next, it's Tani's
single-flower vase.

773
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,560
Wow, it's beautiful!

774
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,760
Amazing!

775
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,520
It's so pretty!

776
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,800
The single-flower vase
looks like a twisted milk bottle.

777
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,440
Its shape aside,

778
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,200
the beautiful light blue
of this glassware is vivid.

779
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,400
It was worth getting burnt.

780
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
- You put your hand on the tip?
- Yeah, I touched it.

781
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,920
So it was your fault.

782
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,720
Wait, the tip...

783
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,920
Next, it's Hotta,
who continued to fail.

784
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,560
It's beautiful.

785
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,520
- Amazing!
- It's pretty!

786
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,880
It's pretty!

787
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,880
A somen noodles bowl.

788
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,280
Of all places,
the part where it's held is sharp,

789
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,080
there's always the risk
of getting injured.

790
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,120
It's scary.

791
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,840
But it's cute in its own way.

792
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,760
I know, it's highlighted by that.

793
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,080
Next, it's Kawakita, who overcame
the roasting work of hell.

794
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,400
- It's done!
- It's pretty!

795
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,360
It's pretty.

796
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,880
It's pretty!

797
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,080
It's tilted, but the glass
is relatively well-made.

798
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,280
She took the trouble to colour it
and it became irregular,

799
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,600
but it made the glassware
look tasteful instead.

800
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
Next, it's Degawa's.

801
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,600
Here!

802
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,440
It's so pretty!

803
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,640
Wonderful!

804
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,320
- Isn't it the best?
- Indeed.

805
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
But...

806
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,640
There's a crack.

807
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,480
Oh, there's a crack.

808
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,880
It's a crack in a heart shape,
of all things.

809
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,960
That was close.
It would break in the usual case.

810
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,080
But the Degawa couple's bond
isn't broken.

811
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,400
What are you talking about?

812
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
There's a crack!

813
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,600
It's at risk.
It's going to be at risk.

814
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,080
- Is this bad?
- It's bad...

815
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,640
- It's a prediction!
- Oh my god!

816
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,480
Lastly, it's Madame's
champagne glass.

817
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,880
Beautiful!

818
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,520
This is too skilled!

819
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,600
Discussion! Discussion!

820
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,360
I made the top part.

821
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,880
A beautiful champagne glass
Madame took much effort to make.

822
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,520
That said, the whole lower half
was made by the teacher.

823
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,040
It's custom-made.

824
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,680
- It's not custom-made!
- Custom-made.

825
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,400
Madame was doing this and went,
"Make this rounder."

826
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,960
- That's what we call custom-made!
- Not custom-made!

827
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,000
At the last part,
they'll go all out for an activity.

828
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,680
This is the activity
we'd like you to do.

829
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,760
- What's this?
- What's this?

830
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,800
"Super Roulette."

831
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,880
They'll rotate and slide towards

832
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,480
the hole in the centre
of this huge waterslide,

833
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,880
Super Roulette.

834
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,800
It's scary.

835
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,520
This time, they'll compete to see
how long they can hold on

836
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
before falling into the water.

837
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,760
Who is going to win?

838
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,120
This is the activity
we'd like you to do.

839
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,200
- What's this?
- What's this?

840
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
"Super Roulette."

841
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,960
They'll rotate and slide towards

842
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,520
the hole in the centre
of this huge waterslide,

843
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,280
Super Roulette.

844
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,760
The three people who fall
the soonest

845
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,360
are going to take a thrill ride.

846
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,480
Oh, again!

847
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,560
It's BIRDMAN, which stands
in Kijima Kogen Park, Yufuin.

848
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,640
All three of them will be raised
30 metres above the ground

849
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,520
and fall in one go, suddenly.

850
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,120
Again...

851
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
- Oh no!
- This is awful!

852
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,800
- It looks fun!
- It looks fun!

853
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,680
Wait, the three of you love it?

854
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,680
We want to take that!

855
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
You three can go, then!

856
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,400
We don't need to play this game!

857
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,440
Let's do the water slide match.

858
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,280
Tani goes first after a game
of rock, paper, scissors.

859
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,040
Ready, go!

860
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,040
How many seconds can she stay there?

861
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,240
Where is she?

862
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,160
- Isn't she good at it?
- She's good.

863
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,280
Tani held on to it till the end.
What's her result?

864
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,320
6.45 seconds.

865
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,120
It's unfavourable to go first,
but her record is quite good.

866
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,360
Degawa is the second one.

867
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,440
Do you know how many games like this
I've played?

868
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,600
I'll stay there for 10 seconds!

869
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,680
And Degawa gets a surprising record.

870
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,160
He's so good at it!

871
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,400
- He's good!
- Impressive!

872
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
That was beautiful.

873
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,560
11.65 seconds.

874
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,760
That's the man, Tetsuro Degawa!
I stayed over 10 seconds!

875
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,120
The third one is Hotta,
who is afraid of thrill rides.

876
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,520
She flew out with a lot of noise...

877
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,880
Wait... Oh no!

878
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,720
But she fell down readily.

879
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,840
5.02 seconds.

880
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,120
Yes!

881
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
Yes!

882
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,600
Her time is hopelessly short
and currently the shortest.

883
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,520
- Here I go!
- Next, Yumeppe.

884
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,560
Off you go!

885
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,040
It's a good start.

886
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,440
Oh no...

887
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,640
She couldn't hold out till the end,

888
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,120
and her record is 6.11 seconds.

889
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,760
"Yanai: 6.11 seconds"

890
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,760
Next, capable at a glance
but can't actually do it,

891
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,600
disappointing Yokota.

892
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,560
Disappointing...

893
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
She screams, but still disappoints.

894
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,200
Oh no...

895
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,040
Her record is 5.11 seconds.

896
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,600
The sixth one is...

897
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,520
It's not the weight, it's the spin.

898
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,840
But you stayed the longest.

899
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,520
It's longer if you're heavier.

900
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,080
I thought weight wasn't related,

901
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,000
but weight matters!

902
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,200
Kawakita is gradually getting
more like Madame.

903
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
How will she do?

904
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Do your best.

905
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,200
She fell down at once.

906
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,200
- It was so quick!
- Super quick!

907
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,520
4.79 seconds.

908
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,360
For sure.

909
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,880
Gosh! You have to be lying!

910
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,240
Did you measure it properly?

911
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,600
At this point, Hotta and Kawakita
will ride on BIRDMAN.

912
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,960
Lastly, it's Madame's turn.

913
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,960
Do your best, Madame.

914
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,120
I won't let the young girls beat me.

915
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,760
- Here I go!
- Will Madame go to BIRDMAN?

916
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,080
Or will it be Yokota?

917
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, here she is.

918
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,520
Oh no...

919
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,480
Madame couldn't hold out.

920
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,640
What's her result?

921
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,080
4.88 seconds.

922
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,360
"Madame: 4.88 seconds"

923
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,320
So Madame will take
the BIRDMAN ride.

924
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,720
Okay, we're here.

925
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,560
- Whoa!
- Wow...

926
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,240
We've arrived
at a frightening place.

927
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,560
Oh no.

928
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,560
Oh, I hate it.

929
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,680
BIRDMAN.

930
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Oh... I panicked.

931
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,520
"Anyone over 60 years old
can't ride this."

932
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
It's a circle.

933
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,080
- It's a circle!
- You startled me!

934
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,320
I thought Madame couldn't ride it,
but it's actually a circle.

935
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Not at all...

936
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,000
Wait, it's a circle. A circle.

937
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,160
You can't get away.

938
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,440
When they go closer to the machine,

939
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,800
Madame starts finding fault.

940
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,920
One of the three people
will pull the start cord.

941
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,200
Who designed this? It's so stupid.

942
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,520
It's going to swing like this,
right?

943
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
Don't be ridiculous.

944
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,600
It's ridiculous.

945
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,840
Some people want to do it,
why don't we let them, Director?

946
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,760
Director...

947
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,200
They're already going to give up.

948
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,920
But here...

949
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,920
Madame, let the three of us
try together.

950
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,240
- Oh!
- How can you say that, traitor?

951
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,960
What traitor?

952
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
Madame, really,

953
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,760
why don't we hold each other's hands
and encourage each other?

954
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,520
Can you smile and say it's fun
up there?

955
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,760
I'll try my best.

956
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,000
Our old girls think about the show
after all.

957
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,000
Let's go! Jump! It's over.

958
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,520
How dare you say that...

959
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,400
No?

960
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,120
Let's do it, then!

961
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,920
- Wow!
- Madame!

962
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,400
You're really cool!

963
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,320
The 81-year-old Madame
finally made up her mind.

964
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,760
Instead, the two old girls
who persuaded her

965
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,720
are on the verge of crying.

966
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,760
But maybe it's going to be fun.

967
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,000
They finally take off.

968
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,640
You can do it!

969
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,600
I have motion sickness!

970
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,960
I feel sick!

971
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,680
Madame is still smiling.

972
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,120
Will they survive?

973
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,840
They're raised to the highest point.

974
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,640
Three,

975
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,640
two,

976
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,560
one,

977
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,600
go!

978
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,960
Here they go!

979
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,560
Go!

980
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,320
It's fun! It's fun!

981
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,720
Madame keeps saying it's fun,
like she's possessed.

982
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,880
It's fun!

983
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,200
Madame is amazing.

984
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,680
- You really are a psychopath.
- It was fun.

985
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,520
That's our 81-year-old Madame!

986
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,280
- Amazing!
- Wonderful!

987
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,880
The three of them survived.

988
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,240
I forgot to spread my arms
like a bird.

989
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,840
Don't bother...

990
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,000
Madame enjoyed
a first-time experience

991
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,400
to the fullest again.

992
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,960
That's all for
Degawa Girls' Gathering.

993
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,680
It's fun!

994
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,280
- You enjoyed it at last.
- I did.

995
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,880
Amazing!

996
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,960
She's superhuman.

997
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,800
When you three had to do it,

998
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,400
Mayuko said no once,
got her own time in the show,

999
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,080
- then went, "Let's do it!"
- I'm embarrassed.

1000
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,320
The way she changed gear
shows she thought about the show.

1001
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,640
How was that, Madame Dewi?

1002
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,280
I think the new Degawa Girls
are good,

1003
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm so happy!

1004
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,680
- It's fresher.
- It's become stereotyped, right?

1005
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,200
The three girls are wearing
similar outfits today too.

1006
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,320
They're all white.

1007
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,720
Right?

1008
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,680
It's full of stereotype.

1009
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,320
I know.

1010
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,840
It isn't just boring,
it's stereotyped!

1011
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,520
Stereotype!

1012
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,200
I haven't heard...

1013
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,040
It's the first time I hear
there's a stereotype.

1014
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,040
You guys are a stereotype!

1015
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,200
I haven't heard.
