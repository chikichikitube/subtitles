00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:18,386
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:22,523
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,963
As far as a strategy goes...

4
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:34,101
I don't want to be aggressive,
and force the others to laugh.

5
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,405
I want to talk with them,
and point out what's funny.

6
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,574
I want to make them laugh
by interacting with them.

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,343
That's my strategy.

8
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,278
The thing is...

9
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,815
To be honest...

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,584
How can I put it?

11
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,553
It's complicated.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,723
I actually disagree with the idea of
keeping a straight face.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,326
I hope this doesn't sound arrogant,
but I don't usually just laugh.

14
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,494
I laugh for comedians.

15
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,532
I think that when you create comedy,
laughter is a necessity.

16
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,601
To be where laughter is prohibited is...

17
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,870
I guess I'm here for the 10 million yen.

18
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,840
Of course, I have to mount an attack.

19
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,843
But I'm more worried about my defenses
when they attack me.

20
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,245
How should I deal with that?

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,284
I'm still wondering what I should do
about that.

22
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,555
They'll do something and I'll laugh.

23
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,423
I have to attack before that.

24
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,498
I think professional comedians always...

25
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:42,002
We keep our heads full of funny ideas.
All day, every day.

26
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,705
I'm sure they do, too.

27
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,408
But what good does that do you?

28
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,578
It's nothing more than like
polishing your gun.

29
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,947
The only thing that matters is the kill.

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,716
The target's right there.
It's called laughter.

31
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,985
Can you rip a hole through the middle?

32
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,154
Can you pull the trigger
without flinching?

33
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,489
That's what matters.

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:03,958
I'm Kojima!

35
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:04,859
Me, too!

36
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:05,893
No, you're not!

37
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:06,894
What a day!

38
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:07,862
Shut up!

39
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,699
What are you doing to my gag?

40
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,136
Timing is a funny thing.

41
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,471
I think there was.

42
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,640
PLAYERS DEFEATED SO FAR:
DAISUKE MIYAGAWA

43
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,142
Can I wash my hands?

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,280
-No, thanks.
-Why? It's just...

45
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,287
I let my guard down.

46
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,623
That means he's out.

47
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,724
No!

48
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,759
-But you really did laugh.
-You did.

49
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,908
Restart.

50
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,877
All right.

51
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,245
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

52
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,414
-That's one player down.
-Okay.

53
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,183
We fell like flies last time.

54
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,851
What should we do with this?

55
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,686
We've had enough of that.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,089
-That's enough.
-No more balls, please.

57
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,423
Look.

58
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,925
I think we've had enough.

59
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,196
Let's do this.

60
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,099
That's not going with the flow.
Let's quit it.

61
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,166
Go with the flow?

62
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,401
That's filthy.

63
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,369
Do you want a go?

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,573
Jimmy went that far for us. Why stop now?

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,807
-No.
-Well...

66
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,516
Why do you want to do it?

67
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,251
Himura has that streak in him.

68
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,253
-Kimura always...
-Kimura?

69
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,955
Why did you call me Kimura?

70
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,225
-It's Himura.
-It's Kimura.

71
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,661
-Kimura?
-Kimura?

72
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,362
-There are no...
-It's Kimura.

73
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,296
It's Himura.

74
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,365
What?

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,334
Kimura?

76
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,838
Is he Kimura?

77
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,407
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,943
-That was rude of you.
-He's Himura.

79
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,047
I think we should definitely do this.

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,648
You can use my balls.

81
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,383
-What?
-You have balls?

82
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,085
Of course, I have balls.

83
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,320
We just saw your breast milk.

84
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,755
I have balls, too.

85
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,925
-Can we see them?
-Be my guest.

86
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,327
That is a bit much.

87
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,829
That's going too far.

88
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,897
We can't do that.

89
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,965
-But she's offering.
-Let's drop it.

90
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,501
Let's look. She said she has balls.

91
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,503
Maybe just you should take a look.

92
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,671
I'm fine, thanks.

93
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,940
-Come take a look.
-Why only me?

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,675
The others don't want a peak.

95
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,544
I'll pass.

96
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,878
I couldn't do it, either.

97
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,513
-No, thanks.
-Come look.

98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,581
No, he couldn't.

99
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,550
I couldn't do that to a lady.

100
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,452
-Come see my balls.
-Yoshimura...

101
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,353
Go and take a look.

102
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,421
For all of us.

103
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,589
Nice move.

104
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,658
If I undo my fly, they'll pop right out.

105
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,327
-How about we...
-Wait. This was your idea.

106
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,097
You must see her balls.

107
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,898
You set it up yourself.

108
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,367
Okay. I'll take a look.
But I need a partner.

109
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,570
No, you don't. That's not how it works.

110
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,938
Leave it to me.

111
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,340
-Jimmy volunteered?
-Kotouge's back.

112
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,410
-Jimmy, what's that?
-What are you offering to do?

113
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,011
I have this. I can take some.

114
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,646
You just want to see her.

115
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,951
He wants to take a Polaroid of her balls.

116
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,052
What a pervert.

117
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,554
There's a disposable camera here, Jimmy.

118
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,623
Is that for non-perverts?

119
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,692
Anyway, Yoshimura should take a look.

120
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,660
Take a look and put an end to this.

121
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,530
-Oshima is offering to show you.
-I'll pop them out.

122
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,898
But do it over there.

123
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,567
-Here will do.
-We don't want to watch.

124
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,003
Shouldn't we suck my balls first?

125
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,514
This is awesome, right?

126
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,784
-What is it?
-It's awesome, right?

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,020
This is what they call "chainmail."

128
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,688
So, that won't hurt?

129
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,756
Not at all.

130
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:03,957
I'd be fine.

131
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,193
-That will protect you?
-Exactly.

132
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,195
-Ninjas wear them, right?
-They do.

133
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,330
That hurts!

134
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,698
That hurts!

135
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,500
That hurts!

136
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,002
God, that hurts!

137
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,870
It didn't work!

138
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,640
It didn't work!

139
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,610
It didn't work at all!

140
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,313
It didn't work at all! It hurt!

141
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,881
Kojima is so close.

142
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,449
It didn't work! Look!

143
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,717
What happened?

144
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,085
I'm dented!

145
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,895
That's rough.

146
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,997
That is bad.

147
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,866
He's leaking.

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,335
But it wasn't that bad.

149
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,803
It didn't hurt that much.

150
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:50,871
It's not that bad.

151
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,140
Who was it? Who laughed?

152
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,308
Who?

153
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,375
Who was it?

154
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,912
Kojima.

155
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,448
That wasn't fair.

156
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,617
He didn't play fair.

157
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,352
However...

158
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,857
I'm not sure if that deserves
a yellow card or an orange card.

159
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,092
I think I kept it in.

160
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,428
If you get a yellow card here,

161
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,463
you are out of the game.

162
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,932
-That will protect you?
-Exactly.

163
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,901
-Ninjas wear them, right?
-They do.

164
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,036
That hurts!

165
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:24,271
That hurts!

166
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,139
That hurts!

167
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,841
God, that hurts!

168
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,644
That moment there?

169
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,650
-I held it in.
-What do you guys think?

170
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,684
I held it in.

171
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,920
-He didn't let out a sound.
-I guess not.

172
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,421
Decision made.

173
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,057
-That's really on the line.
-Could go either way.

174
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,158
Orange.

175
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,029
-That was close.
-That gets an orange card.

176
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,697
You were on the attack.

177
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,765
Thank you.

178
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,272
That was close, Kojima.

179
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,840
Restart.

180
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,678
-That was strong.
-That was dangerous.

181
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,780
Let's keep this injury-free.

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,582
Seriously, no injuries.

183
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,984
I have a weird story
I want you all to hear.

184
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,352
It's about my mom...

185
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,154
When I was in junior high,

186
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,591
my mom had a silver cap on
one of her front teeth.

187
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:18,759
That was a little odd.

188
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,260
But it got stranger.

189
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,330
Usually the entire tooth is silver, right?

190
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,332
But, in my mom's case,

191
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,603
the part near the gum was silver,
but the rest was a normal tooth.

192
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,438
-The woman in that photo?
-Yes.

193
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,040
-With the hula hoop?
-Yes.

194
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,443
I have a photo. It's weird.

195
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,546
Look at this.

196
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,748
See the narrow bit here?

197
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,016
Fujimoto...

198
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,017
See?

199
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,252
Can you see it?

200
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,454
She has a really thin silver-capped tooth.

201
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,989
What is that?

202
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,358
I understand the left tooth.

203
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,060
It's a silver-capped tooth.

204
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,162
What's the narrow bit in the middle?

205
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,631
Why is there a narrow piece of silver
in between?

206
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,900
Look. That's a tooth.

207
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,369
In the middle, there's a piece of silver.

208
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
Why?

209
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,508
You should show Jimmy, too.

210
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,943
No, I already...

211
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,379
No. I already know.

212
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,048
You know? What do you know?

213
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,850
I get the general idea.

214
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,486
You get the general idea?

215
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,455
You should look at the photo.

216
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,657
A general idea isn't good enough.

217
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,794
She has a silver cap in the middle.

218
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,830
I can't understand this narrow bit.

219
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,431
-What is it?
-I already saw it.

220
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,066
What happened there?

221
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,201
It's malpractice.

222
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,671
Then she tells me she's a javelin thrower.

223
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,744
Who laughed?

224
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,213
-It was Tsuda.
-He laughed, right?

225
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,147
He laughed.

226
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,615
-Did you cry?
-You hid.

227
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,683
You laughed, right?

228
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,251
Tsuda?

229
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,388
-He laughed, right?
-He did.

230
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,389
He laughed.

231
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,224
-I think it's him.
-Really?

232
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,493
Why?

233
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,361
Because of this.

234
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,231
-There was a trap?
-Yeah.

235
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,934
-Somebody laid a trap.
-You couldn't not laugh at that.

236
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,369
Tsuda laughed, right?

237
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,738
Did I really laugh?

238
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,373
-You did.
-At the trap.

239
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,309
Somebody placed Joyman's Takagi
on the hula hoop.

240
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,179
You laughed because of this?

241
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,114
You turned around and saw this?

242
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,618
Apparently he turned around and saw this.

243
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,453
He fits nicely on the hula hoop.

244
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,857
However, the cameras may not have
actually caught Tsuda laughing.

245
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,659
Let's take a look.

246
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,228
It's malpractice.

247
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,565
Then she tells me she's a javelin thrower.

248
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,038
But...

249
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:45,939
That was...

250
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,507
All I did was...

251
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,642
I only said, "Ha!"

252
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,610
One "Ha!" Just one "Ha!"

253
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,913
We couldn't see your face.

254
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,281
I didn't even smile.

255
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,016
-Just "Ha!"
-That's still out.

256
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,017
"Ha!"

257
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,252
Even the slightest mistake means
you're out.

258
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,320
Yes, sir!

259
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,755
-Seriously.
-Yes, sir!

260
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,858
-This orange card is virtually yellow.
-Thank you, sir!

261
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,594
Please punch me, too.

262
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,564
But I get why you laughed.

263
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,866
It's all Joyman's fault.

264
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,501
No more second chances!

265
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,869
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:24,811
Restart.

267
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,580
Okay.

268
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:27,781
I have to focus.

269
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,283
Are you hungry?

270
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,386
Should I make something?

271
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,256
Well, maybe if we boiled some water,

272
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,091
we could make something.

273
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,064
If you're making ramen...

274
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,199
-Would you like some?
-That sounds nice.

275
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,734
We can make fried noodles.

276
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,869
Make it ramen.

277
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,704
What's with Jimmy?

278
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,473
He said, "That sounds nice"?

279
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,342
He's trying to act cool now?

280
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,511
Make it soy sauce flavor.

281
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,479
You're tired, right?

282
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,814
Me?

283
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,750
-No, I'm not...
-You suddenly stopped moving.

284
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,285
But everyone's busy.

285
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,654
I want to do something, but...

286
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,189
There aren't any bricks.

287
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,758
-Bricks?
-What do you mean by "bricks"?

288
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,893
Huh?

289
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,596
Bricks are what you use to build houses...

290
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,864
We know that much.

291
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,534
We're asking why you mentioned bricks.

292
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,603
If I had bricks, I could do something.
But there aren't any.

293
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,705
Oh, you're a karate expert?

294
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,907
I'm a karate expert.

295
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,875
-Bricks to break?
-I see!

296
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,144
-Did you learn karate?
-I did for a bit...

297
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,480
That was a surprise.

298
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,570
That sure was a great face.

299
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,239
-The classic comedian.
-Indeed.

300
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,942
That was the face of a classic comedian.

301
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,412
Two hours have passed.

302
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,481
That means we've done one-third of this.

303
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,984
-Is somebody missing?
-We've lost a few people.

304
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,119
-Himura and...
-Himura is gone.

305
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,287
What happened?

306
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,563
He's going to hurt himself.

307
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,541
Look at Fujimoto.

308
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,776
Is Fujimoto out?

309
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,078
Is he out?

310
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,214
I can't get a grip.

311
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,617
-He can't...
-Sorry.

312
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,219
He can't hold on and close the door.

313
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,259
What was that?

314
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,827
What was it?

315
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,832
He is such an idiot.

316
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,001
I can't take this.

317
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,037
That was really too much.

318
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,940
Isn't it amazing how
we can show our dicks here?

319
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,576
True. That doesn't happen
on variety shows nowadays.

320
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:10,644
You're right.

321
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,947
-Ouch.
-Why is he wearing a judo outfit?

322
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,815
I didn't try to commit suicide.

323
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,218
-Take a look-see.
-A look-see?

324
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,319
What's wrong?

325
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,588
He ripped his wrist.

326
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,757
-I ripped my wrist.
-Just then?

327
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,158
I ripped my wrist.

328
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,793
Just then.

329
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,162
-Are you okay?
-Don't outdo yourself.

330
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,097
-You're not young anymore.
-Just then.

331
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,432
Just then.

332
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,267
-We get it.
-Yeah.

333
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,336
-He's too much.
-Is that all?

334
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,972
"Take a look-see"?

335
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,444
-If I was closer, I would've laughed.
-Let's go closer.

336
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,579
-The distance saved me.
-I see.

337
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,948
Whoever loses rock-paper-scissors
stands here.

338
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,519
It might surprise them on the other side,
and they'll laugh.

339
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,788
-Like a counterattack.
-I see.

340
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,156
Rock-paper-scissors...

341
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,893
Who is that?

342
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,328
Saito?

343
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,932
Whatever he's trying to build up here,
it's too complicated.

344
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,568
Why do you like breasts so much?

345
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,503
Did you always like breasts?

346
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,340
-Breasts haven't been a hit here today.
-Exactly.

347
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,610
You should only try the same joke twice
if it was funny the first time around.

348
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,412
My blow-up doll won't blow up.

349
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,948
You only brought titties
to thish sh-show...

350
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,292
No way.

351
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,728
I'm out for that?

352
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,162
One stutter.

353
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,067
-My, oh my. He totally laughed.
-Yes, he did.

354
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,502
Is this for real?

355
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,637
That was a terrific stutter.

356
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,573
It was an awesome stutter.

357
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,313
Kojima.

358
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,351
Is this how it ends?

359
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,353
You can't complain.

360
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,128
That stutter was... It was incredible.

361
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,130
I don't even know what I tried to say.

362
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,031
Maybe we should take another look.

363
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,437
You should only try the same joke twice
if it was funny the first time around.

364
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,305
My blow-up doll won't blow up.

365
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,841
You only brought titties
to thish sh-show...

366
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,680
What kind of stutter was that?

367
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,284
-What did he say?
-It wasn't even a clear stutter.

368
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,053
-Then Fujimoto pointed it out.
-I said, "Eh?"

369
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,889
That finished me off.

370
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,125
Does that count as Kotouge's point?

371
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,528
-Let me think about that.
-I'm not sure.

372
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,062
It may be Fujimoto's.

373
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,732
-I think I laughed at Fujimoto.
-When I said, "Eh?"

374
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,300
He did make the reaction.

375
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,569
-But who started it?
-Me. I knew he would...

376
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,005
You can't give him anything.
He wasn't involved.

377
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,607
-There's no denying I set it up.
-No way possible.

378
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,044
Your titty thing wasn't even
remotely funny.

379
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,948
Let me get my things.

380
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,417
Was Kojima about to do something?

381
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:05,852
Probably.

382
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,789
When Kojima opened the curtain just now,
I saw Himura on standby.

383
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,626
He was waiting.

384
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,098
Why come out now?

385
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,100
What a waste!

386
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,503
-Why waste that?
-I felt embarrassed.

387
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,041
You lost the timing to come out, right?

388
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,410
He was stuck over there,
staring at the mirror.

389
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,645
You're embarrassing me even more.

390
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,216
Hurry up and go home, Kojima.

391
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,051
I laughed.

392
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,587
Losing a million yen hurts.

393
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,525
It's so hard to describe.

394
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,697
The atmosphere in that room is
a mixture of funny and bloodthirsty.

395
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,600
That room defies description.

396
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,401
My blow-up doll won't blow up.

397
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,971
You only brought titties
to thish sh-show...

398
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,108
We're all trying out
a bunch of different things.

399
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,211
But I think nothing is going
according to plan for anybody.

400
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,513
Myself included.

401
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,282
Then something new pops up
the moment we make a move.

402
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,217
It's just so unpredictable.

403
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,058
You can't eat yet.
You have to play out that character first.

404
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,261
-Do it from the top.
-It's already done.

405
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,096
You have to make an entrance first.

406
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,198
Do it for the guy on your stomach.

407
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,165
For this guy?

408
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,001
But you won't laugh.

409
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,737
Or do you think we should wait for
the restart?

410
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,406
I'll wait for the restart,
if you don't mind.

411
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:54,327
-Let's give him a proper burial.
-Yeah, it's the least we can do.

412
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,095
-Let's all watch.
-Okay.

413
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,398
Even though we won't laugh.

414
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,471
That definitely would have worked.

415
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,707
-That would've been close.
-Definitely.

416
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,510
-If we hadn't already seen it.
-That was a strong card.

417
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,745
-Nice resemblance.
-We noticed.

418
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,080
But nobody's laughing.

419
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,882
Because we already saw it.

420
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,517
Kotouge.

421
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,756
-It's not funny?
-There's no difference.

422
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,392
-I don't look different?
-You look exactly the same.

423
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,494
It doesn't work if you look the same.

424
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,829
It's not funny?

425
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,297
It's not funny?

426
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,865
Poor Himura.

427
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,868
You really don't look different.

428
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,938
It looks like you got a gold cap.
That's all.

429
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,675
Sorry, Himura, but that's funny.
He's stuck there.

430
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,776
They don't suit me?

431
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,813
They'd be funnier on somebody else.
Why did you put them on?

432
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,848
-You wasted them.
-I sure did.

433
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,422
Himura, thanks.

434
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,057
-Nice try.
-Thank you.

435
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,797
-The ramen is ready.
-I guess I'll have some.

436
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,266
It may be cold by now.

437
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,735
-Sorry.
-Thanks.

438
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,071
Here.

439
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,507
And some chopsticks.

440
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,042
Thanks.

441
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,244
Aren't you going to eat?

442
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,646
I'm good.

443
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,713
Okay.

444
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,686
He can't hold his chopsticks.

445
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,293
It's sweet.

446
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,430
It's sweet.

447
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,233
-It's sweet?
-It's sweet!

448
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,568
Why is it so sweet?

449
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,971
-It's sweet.
-Sweet?

450
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,674
You put sugar in it, didn't you?

451
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,743
Oshima!

452
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,851
-You should've been expecting that!
-She's out?

453
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,853
You put it in yourself?

454
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:02,989
Then you should've...

455
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,191
Oshima, I'm gonna hit you.

456
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,593
That was so sweet.

457
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,399
My stomach hurts.

458
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,435
My stomach hurts.

459
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,804
Caught in her own trap.

460
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,139
So that means, Oshima...

461
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,974
You're out.

462
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,644
Oshima, too?

463
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,018
So, did you do something?

464
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,587
I made his ramen
half-filled with orange juice.

465
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,222
It was so sweet.

466
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,596
It's sweet.

467
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,498
It's sweet.

468
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,434
-It's sweet?
-It's sweet.

469
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,636
Why is it so sweet?

470
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,172
-It's sweet.
-Sweet?

471
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,842
You put sugar in it, didn't you?

472
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,911
Oshima!

473
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,516
Wow.

474
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,253
That was a poorly written mystery.

475
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,288
A poorly written mystery?

476
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,957
This is too much.

477
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,658
-Ready to go?
-Yes. Thank you!

478
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,626
Bye, Oshima!

479
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,361
That was really stupid.

480
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,130
-Good work.
-Jimmy's still angry.

481
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,365
She looks like a home care worker.

482
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,436
-Thank you.
-She really does.

483
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,575
-So, it's over.
-Yes.

484
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,312
Unfortunately.

485
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:39,485
It went just as I planned, but...

486
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,088
What a shame.

487
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,494
Our mic batteries...

488
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,396
Maybe we should switch batteries.

489
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,331
-Should we do it now?
-I don't know.

490
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:55,535
Should we wait until we have
two hours left? Or do it now?

491
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,570
-Another thirty minutes.
-Let's do it.

492
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,905
What time is it?

493
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,407
Ready, go.

494
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,178
Should we switch them now?

495
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,680
-Yeah. It's already past 11:00 p.m.
-But...

496
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,081
This smells funny.

497
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,151
Who cares how long they last?
It says, "Change after 11:00 p.m."

498
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,320
I was told to change them
after four hours.

499
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:17,056
Are you stupid?
Why does it say 11:00 p.m. here?

500
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,257
That's why I...

501
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,859
-Idiot!
-I made a mistake!

502
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,037
Eh?

503
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,473
I'd go "Eh?" too.

504
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,142
Isn't he laughing?

505
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,044
-Not at all.
-He is.

506
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,579
Are you sure?

507
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,813
I'm like this.

508
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,082
But that's...

509
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,884
Saito.

510
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,322
-He laughed, right?
-He did.

511
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,924
What now?

512
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,697
Do you know this?

513
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,232
Super Million Hair.

514
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,702
Please do it.

515
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,137
-What do I do?
-Just sprinkle it on.

516
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,708
-Have you seen it before?
-Never.

517
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,613
Wow.

518
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,892
That's really... That's really scary.

519
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:13,706
-You should wash that off.
-You're right.

520
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,308
Do it over there.

521
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,376
Don't do it here.

522
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,016
-What was that?
-I felt a breeze. Sorry.

523
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,252
-Do it over there.
-Okay. Sorry.

524
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,954
Where does Saito want to do it?

525
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,389
What are you trying to do, Saito?

526
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:33,159
I want to wash his unique hairstyle
in a unique way.

527
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,593
Do it over here.

528
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,429
-Do it here.
-Come this way.

529
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,165
Things got a bit weird there.
I should wash it off.

530
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,599
We must wash it all off.

531
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,101
Head down, please.

532
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,869
What are you trying to do, Saito?

533
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,137
Head down.

534
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,148
It keeps coming.

535
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,383
Wow.

536
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,319
He keeps spitting.

537
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,787
He has that much?

538
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,591
-What's he doing?
-What are you doing, Saito?

539
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,626
-Saito.
-That's enough.

540
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,929
-Saito.
-I said that's enough.

541
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,297
What are you doing?

542
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,069
What are you doing?

543
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,310
What are you doing?

544
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:25,378
That's right!

545
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,179
Huh?

546
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:28,647
What's he doing?

547
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,774
The Ice Bucket Challenge.

548
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,543
The Ice Bucket Challenge?
I remember that.

549
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,544
Now?

550
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:00,679
The Ice Bucket Challenge.

551
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,415
That was my Ice Bucket Challenge.

552
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,017
I wasn't expecting that at all.

553
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,585
Let's take a look.

554
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,654
What are you doing?

555
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,722
That's right.

556
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,524
Huh?

557
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:12,992
What's he doing?

558
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,729
It did come out of the blue.

559
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:25,771
That's a laugh.

560
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,339
That is definitely...

561
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:28,741
Out!

562
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,849
-You do such stupid things.
-It wasn't stupid. Don't say that.

563
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,084
Right out of the blue.

564
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,554
I think it seemed like
I'd be the last one standing.

565
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,824
I went on the offense this time,
over and over again.

566
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,059
I gave it everything I had.

567
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,128
But Fujimoto totally beat me.

568
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:02,007
-I was challenged.
-It's been three and a half hours...

569
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,609
-That's why...
-Oh, sorry.

570
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,812
In the Ice Bucket Challenge,
you challenge other people, right?

571
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,949
I thought you'd all done it.
That's why I got challenged.

572
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,283
Who challenged you?

573
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,252
It was...

574
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:18,924
Are you okay?

575
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,197
Why are you so loud?

576
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,700
-I couldn't help it.
-That's amazing.

577
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,603
That really left its mark.

578
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,637
Ice it.

579
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,405
Let's ice that.

580
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,542
That wouldn't happen to me.

581
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,711
Even if we hit you?

582
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,880
No matter how hard we hit, you won't yell?

583
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,214
Not with a bat-spank.

584
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,983
Is that possible?

585
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,352
I should hit him hard, right?

586
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,087
His butt doesn't bruise?

587
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,889
-Don't do it.
-Stop it.

588
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,423
So, your butt doesn't bruise?

589
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,324
Will here do?

590
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,460
He means that he won't make a sound.

591
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:55,528
I won't yell.

592
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,795
Wow.

593
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,235
Wow.

594
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,737
Nothing can hurt him.

595
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:07,907
Tsuda is in trouble.

596
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:09,842
It's a hard bat.

597
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,710
Tsuda's on his last chance.

598
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,713
That has to hurt.

599
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,515
You're fine?

600
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,417
How?

601
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,119
Why?

602
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,821
Nothing comes out.

603
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,491
-There's no padding.
-You did something, right?

604
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:26,759
How bad is the bruise?

605
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,195
Huh? There's no bruise!

606
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,130
You really are...

607
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,900
You really don't have a mark.

608
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,069
Why is there no mark?

609
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,938
Why doesn't he have a mark?

610
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:40,272
Take a look.

611
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,407
Then look at mine.

612
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:48,714
Seriously?

613
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,716
What's your problem?

614
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,986
-Would you like a try?
-Give it a shot.

615
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,454
It's gonna hurt.

616
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,223
At this time of night, it's...

617
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:58,991
It's not a good idea.

618
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,559
I won't hold back.

619
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,432
That has to hurt!

620
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,303
Again?

621
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,105
Quit it, Himura.

622
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,340
Me?

623
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,275
He won't give it a full clean swing.

624
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:19,478
I can't do this. He's my senior.

625
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,046
Is it okay?

626
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,349
You have to swing as hard as you can.

627
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:24,850
Seriously?

628
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,624
-That had to hurt.
-You chipped him.

629
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,826
-That means trouble.
-He's hurting.

630
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,261
Totally wrong move.

631
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,563
Are you a klutz?

632
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,301
But he's okay, right?

633
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:43,569
-No pain?
-None.

634
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:45,437
I'm sorr...

635
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,844
Can you hit me next?

636
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,515
Hit me next. I found just the right thing.

637
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,253
What are you doing?

638
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,589
-I found a ball.
-That's dangerous.

639
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,025
It's too dangerous.
What are you trying to do?

640
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,159
Tell us your plan.

641
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,728
I throw it, he hits it,
the ball flies by my face.

642
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:10,796
That won't work.

643
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,265
Give it a shot.

644
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,901
But be careful. Don't lose your head.

645
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,169
Ready?

646
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,139
Ouch.

647
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,374
-I couldn't reach.
-Really? Sorry.

648
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,642
Come closer.

649
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,911
-Maybe you should...
-Try throwing it.

650
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,013
-Just try it.
-Hey, guys...

651
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,882
Stockings are elastic.

652
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,050
It will bounce back.

653
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,585
-Back and forth.
-You need to throw it hard.

654
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,953
Maybe I should throw it.

655
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,222
If I throw it, he can hit it, right?

656
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,224
If I stand here, I'll hit him.

657
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,060
Just let it hang down.

658
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,461
That won't...

659
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,763
What are you trying to do?

660
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,569
-If it just hangs, I won't reach.
-But you can hit it.

661
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,137
I said I'll throw it.

662
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:54,440
Then throw it.

663
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,241
Let go!

664
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,910
Tsuda, throw it.

665
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,312
Come in the middle.

666
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,949
Stand in between us, then he'll throw it.

667
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,652
Ready?

668
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,787
Wait a minute.

669
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,090
Swing it like a pendulum.

670
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,991
-Like this?
-That's it.

671
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,193
Here goes.

672
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,427
Will this really work?

673
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,962
We can practice.

674
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,597
We don't practice!

675
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,233
You're the one who started this!

676
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,267
Don't fight.

677
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,737
Stop fighting. Just give it a shot.

678
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,705
Watch out for his face.

679
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,507
My bat won't reach.

680
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:29,775
If you hit my face...

681
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,710
That would be really dangerous.

682
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,579
-I'll throw it softly.
-Very softly.

683
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,914
Just let it go and sling on down.

684
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,383
Like a pendulum.

685
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,318
It won't reach if I do that.

686
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,753
Just try it.

687
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,020
Try it once.

688
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,122
I'll do it.

689
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,456
I need the perfect ball.

690
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:45,624
I know already!

691
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,759
I'll do it!

692
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:47,860
I'll do it.

693
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,161
Then do it.

694
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:51,163
-Maybe I should...
-Here we go.

695
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,666
The thing is,
I don't think it will reach him.

696
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,034
Please, Tsuda.

697
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,403
Just throw it once.

698
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,804
Then we can fine tune it.

699
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,906
-Got it.
-We've made no progress, yet.

700
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,442
-You laughed
-I didn't.

701
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,643
Your face is laughing.

702
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,346
-Just do it.
-I was angry!

703
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,116
-Watch.
-Drop it.

704
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,218
Where did the ball go?

705
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:16,088
Tell me how you thought it would work!

706
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,024
The moment I held it, I knew!

707
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,592
I knew it wouldn't reach him!

708
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,594
No way would it reach!

709
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,898
-Maybe you should...
-Listen, Tsuda.

710
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,901
You have it all wrong.
It's your course that was off.

711
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,035
Just do this.

712
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,336
It bounced!

713
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,638
It reached you!

714
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,440
-Like that.
-It worked.

715
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,941
Your throw was off.

716
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,216
You know...

717
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,086
-Jimmy already did this kind of thing.
-You're right.

718
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,055
We've seen plenty of this.

719
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,858
Aren't you being too negative?

720
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,893
You dismiss everything I do.

721
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,996
Everyone did every joke I prepared
before me.

722
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,033
I guess that's just bad luck.

723
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,669
They say comedy requires luck, right?

724
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,671
I lasted this long. I have some luck.

725
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,779
I used every gag I brought
an hour and a half ago, too.

726
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,916
What should I do for the next three hours?
Please tell me.

727
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,219
My blow-up doll won't blow up.

728
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:22,955
It has a hole.

729
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:25,157
-Try drinking soy sauce.
-That's lethal.

730
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,326
-I will, if you'll laugh.
-He can't.

731
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,061
He'll get sick.

732
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,630
-But if he laughs...
-No, don't do it.

733
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:32,631
You'll die.

734
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,967
What should we do? I'm out of props.

735
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,737
Why are you stealing my turn?

736
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,173
That was my turn.

737
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,375
You do that every time!

738
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,945
It's not my fault. We're the same type.

739
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,881
-Tell him about it.
-Don't blame me.

740
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,649
-Get it off your chest.
-Go for it.

741
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,084
-Every time!
-Go for it.

742
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,119
Let's end this. Rock-paper-scissors.

743
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,489
Why should we use such a simple method?

744
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:02,094
Are you saying top comedians have to play
rock-paper-scissors to make a decision?

745
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,462
He's right. Seriously.

746
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,631
We mean hyper rock-paper-scissors.

747
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:09,635
Make it the most intense game
of rock-paper-scissors in your lives.

748
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,103
That's worth a shot.

749
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,505
From the very start, it will be full-on.

750
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:14,973
You know...

751
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,581
Rock-paper-scissors!

752
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,220
Tsuda's timing is ridiculous.

753
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,788
He's screwing it up.

754
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,958
Who's that supposed to be?
Masayuki Suzuki?

755
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,694
Suzuki... What's his name?

756
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,963
Getting back to the game...

757
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,169
That was all his fault.

758
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,972
-He must have heard us out here.
-You're right.

759
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,575
-He did it on purpose.
-He tried to ruin us.

760
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,411
-That was cruel.
-Why wear sneakers?

761
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,948
My dear lover

762
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,016
He'd never wear shoes like that.

763
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:01,553
-Your shoes!
-Are you Masayuki Suzuki?

764
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,389
Are you Director Izutsu?

765
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,891
No, no

766
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,597
-Director Izutsu, right?
-No, no

767
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,636
Fujimoto is in trouble.

768
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,008
-Director Izutsu?
-No, no

769
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:25,477
Don't get me wrong

770
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,813
Then who are you?

771
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,782
Oh, wait a minute.

772
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,719
He has a mustache.

773
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,722
And sunglasses...

774
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,958
Who has a mustache and wears sunglasses?

775
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,793
Director Izutsu?

776
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,062
No, no

777
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,399
"Don't get me wrong"?

778
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,234
My feelings

779
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,302
You changed it.

780
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,139
-The teacher from Rokudenashi Blues?
-No, no

781
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:55,407
Mr. Morita?

782
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:56,608
No...

783
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,010
The muscly guy.

784
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,778
Oh, yeah.

785
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:03,482
Who is it?

786
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:05,384
Tashiro?

787
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,219
No, no

788
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,122
My feelings

789
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,691
-Your feelings?
-You laughed.

790
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:16,428
I don't need any more tears

791
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,597
-You laughed.
-He did laugh.

792
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,165
You laughed at "Tashiro."

793
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,202
Hara sent me the Ice Bucket Challenge!

794
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,608
Then you must be Suzuki.

795
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,014
"See you in Shibuya..."

796
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,249
At 5:00 p.m.

797
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,384
-See? It must be him.
-Yeah. Definitely.

798
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:40,719
It's definitely him.

799
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:49,828
"See you in Yoyogi..."

800
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,129
At 5:00 p.m.

801
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,900
-He laughed.
-Look.

802
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,571
-See you in Shibuya
-Really?

803
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,540
Are you telling us that was safe?

804
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,308
At 5:00 p.m.

805
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,778
That's definitely him.

806
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,750
Wait a minute.

807
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,287
-What's he doing?
-What are you doing?

808
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:16,822
That's funny.

809
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,758
Tsuda!

810
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,295
Tsuda had a lot of little mishaps,
didn't he?

811
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,596
He sure did.

812
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,498
-You did.
-Yes.

813
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,569
-You laughed, right?
-You did.

814
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:31,970
-You did.
-Several times.

815
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:35,440
And I've already given you an orange card.

816
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,109
Shinya Yamamoto?

817
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,910
No, no

818
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,812
Don't get me wrong

819
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:48,687
Let's take a look.

820
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,255
You laughed a few times.

821
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,923
You laughed over and over again!

822
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,061
I saw your smile so much,
it became part of my daily routine.

823
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,730
I got used to it, too. Sorry.

824
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,469
"See you in Yoyogi..."

825
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,771
At 5:00 p.m.

826
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,010
The timing of your entrance was
weird, too.

827
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,547
In the middle of their thing.
You ruined their rock-scissors-paper.

828
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,916
You just strolled on out.

829
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,352
Even though nobody called you.

830
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,389
You ended up like the old guy in
the Kobutori Jiisan folktale.

831
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,694
That was all I had prepared.

832
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,929
Director Izutsu?

833
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:33,198
No, no

834
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,801
I did them all.

835
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,271
And I really liked that hula hoop photo.

836
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,173
I thought that would be funny.

837
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:42,974
I'm sorry, Mom.

838
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,844
This is bad.

839
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,079
Look at him.

840
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,785
It's stuck that strongly.

841
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,862
That is tough. That is really tough.

842
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,997
I'm ready!

843
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,300
That hurts!

844
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:09,401
Stop!

845
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,836
It hurts!

846
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,470
Hurry up and pull it!

847
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,773
They're super-stretched.
