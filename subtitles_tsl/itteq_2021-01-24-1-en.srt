1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,920
Three, two, enter!

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,720
- That's fast.
- That's incredible.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,920
Three, two, enter!

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,280
This is no joke. This is hard.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,040
"The Quest"

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,040
"This programme was broadcast
31 January, 2021"

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,640
The Quest has started.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,400
Tonight, we have rare animal
Hunter Imoto Japan tour,

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,560
and Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,600
"Daisuke Miyagawa, Soichi Nakaoka,
Asako Ito, Ayako Imoto"

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,560
"Kazuko Kurosawa, Miyuki Oshima,
Tetsuro Degawa, Tomoko Murakami"

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,400
Now, where did you go
this time, Imoto?

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,680
This was the tenth location
of Japan Tour.

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,400
- I see.
- I went to Shizuoka this time.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,320
I went to places that are a bit
peculiar and not mainstream.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
So we won't see any hot springs?

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,680
None whatsoever!

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,640
- It's not like with "Hirunandesu"?
- None whatsoever.

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,000
You won't be watching this and go,
"Let's go there next weekend."

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,800
Let's get going then!

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,000
- The Quest!
- The Quest!

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,960
Yeah!

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,480
It sways a lot.

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,880
This is how wide it is now.

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,760
It's kicking. Kick won't stop now!

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm coming up there.

27
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,320
I'm coming up there.

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
"Collaborating with female
high school students, number two"

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,720
"Lotti Nakaoka's QTube in Fukuoka"

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
That's great.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,920
Conquer all 47 prefectures of Japan!

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,520
Rare animal hunter Imoto,
Japan Tour!

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,240
She headed to Shizuoka,
of the magnificent Mt. Fuji.

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,960
Hello! Hello! It's Imoto!

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm here in Shizuoka right now!

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,600
Now, where am I?

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
Now, the usual, let's find Imoto!

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,280
I'm here!

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,440
- I'm here! I'm right here!
- Over there?

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
I was peeking out of the window
of a neighbouring house

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,760
- near the suspension bridge.
- What is this?

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,600
Oi River in Shizuoka is known to
have several suspension bridges.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,400
A suspension bridge without a pier
is perfect for a fast river.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,320
You walk right over someone's house.

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,880
You can see cars driving below too.
This is scary.

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,960
This suspension bridge in Shiogo
was built 90 years ago.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,320
Once, students rode their bikes
on it to go to school.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,440
Its biggest highlight is that
steam locomotives run below it.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
So we came up with this segment.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,360
Hello, I'm Imolyn Monroe.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,120
Now, we are going to take
a miraculous photograph

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,560
with Oi-River railways' steam
locomotive and I, Imolyn Monroe.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,680
Marilyn Monroe's skirt fluttered
above a subway ventilation.

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,760
Here, they will experiment
with the steam from the train.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,280
The steam locomotive is approaching.

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
This doesn't look too good.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,720
- Boy...
- I think it's going to work.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,920
- The skirt didn't flutter at all.
- That's too bad.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Let's start the Shizuoka tour!

60
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
First, let us introduce
an amazing expert!

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,280
Shizuoka is actually famous
for its canned goods.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,320
In particular, you can say

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,680
that most canned tuna are made
in Shizuoka.

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,320
97% of it is produced in Shizuoka.

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
The expert works at a canning plant.

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
He's hitting the cans with a stick.

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,760
The sound changes
with the amount of air in cans.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,760
So he's removing the cans
that sound different.

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,520
- At this speed?
- Yes.

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
- He is a tapping inspector.
- A tapping inspector?

71
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,360
If the can contains too much air,

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,400
the expiration date's accuracy
can't be maintained.

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,600
They have the skill to differentiate
the sound and the feel with a tap.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,400
- That's amazing.
- Yes, that's part of the process.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,080
So we came up with an experiment.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,320
We will have one can of tuna
in cans of miso flavoured mackerel.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,760
Will he be able to distinguish it?

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,200
He is a professional
at distinguishing the quality,

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,400
but whether he can tell
its contents is unknown.

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
I can do it.

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,520
You'll do it?

82
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,160
- You've never done it before--
- I can do it!

83
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
Will he be able
to get the right one?

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,360
"The correct answer is to select
the canned tuna"

85
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,080
- That's incredible!
- Really?

86
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,960
- It's this one.
- That's fast!

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,960
Wow!

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
This is incredible!

89
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,000
This is canned tuna!

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,600
- I got it right.
- That's amazing.

91
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,800
That's great!

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,280
I'm impressed.

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,080
What is the limitation
of this tapping inspector?

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
It has the same contents,
but its flavour is different.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,360
We'll challenge him with plain
and miso-flavoured mackerel.

96
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
- Can you do it?
- I can do it.

97
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,080
It's correct if he picks
the plain mackerel.

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
If he picks the plain one?

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,640
"Plain mackerel
is the correct choice"

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Really?

102
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,240
How is that possible?

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
That's incredible.

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,040
That's amazing.

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
No way!

106
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,400
Incredible!

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
That's incredible!

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,920
This is amazing.

109
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
You are correct!

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,640
I did it!

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
You went beyond your limits.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
What do you think, plant manager?

113
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,360
That's awesome!

114
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,560
It is, right?

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,720
Could we try the bonus round then?

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,640
Are we going for that?

117
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
Yes.

118
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
Here's the bonus challenge!

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,640
One can contains a 10,000-yen note,

120
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,400
and the other nine cans
contain 1,000-yen notes.

121
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
He got one.

122
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
So Kitagami, you think this one
has the 10,000-yen note?

123
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,280
This one...
This one has the 10,000-yen note.

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,320
So this is 10,000-yen.

125
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,240
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,160
Come on!

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,440
There.

128
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
That's too bad!

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
That's too bad!

130
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
Here's your guaranteed fee
for today.

131
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,520
Thank you very much!

132
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Next up is a report
on a rare insect.

133
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,160
She came to Ryuyo Insect Nature
Observation Park.

134
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,120
I see a suspicious looking figure.

135
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

136
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,760
She will be guided by Konchu-kun.

137
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Do you dress up like this
on your own?

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm dressing up like
an insect loving boy.

139
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,800
- I see.
- Yes, that's how I do it.

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
Can I take a look at your back too?

141
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,400
Ah, that's cute.

142
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,040
This is my golden stag beetle
backpack.

143
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
I didn't quite get that.

144
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,360
What he showed her was...

145
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
This is an insect called
Pheropsophus Jessoensis.

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
Pheropsophus... what?

147
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,280
This is a tiny insect that's less
than two centimetres long.

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
It inhabits in areas from
Hokkaido to Amamioshima.

149
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,600
You can find these insects
in rice fields

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
and along the river banks,
so they're not that rare.

151
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,760
What's so magnificent about
this insect?

152
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,480
Its fart is hot.

153
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,440
If you touch it directly,
you'll burn your hand.

154
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,880
- It's that hot?
- Yes.

155
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
It's said to be close to
100-degrees Celsius.

156
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
A fart that's close to
100-degrees Celsius?

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,920
Take a look at this.

158
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,080
What?

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
He picked it up right now.

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
- Oh!
- It farted.

161
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,240
It farted!

162
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,160
I think I saw steam come out
with it too.

163
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,120
If you sniff around this area,
maybe you'll smell that distinct...

164
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,240
It stinks!

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,200
It's fumy...

166
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,480
and it's smoky.

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,680
It generates two chemicals
in its body.

168
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,440
This fart is produced as a result
of that chemical reaction.

169
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,000
- Thank you.
- When we observe the thermography,

170
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
its hotness is clearly seen.

171
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,200
Oh! It farted!

172
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,120
It's their defence mechanism to
protect themselves from an enemy.

173
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,160
That's amazing.

174
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,360
Fart...

175
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,480
This fart is interesting.

176
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,120
This facility has another
unique curator.

177
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm the cockroach
specialist Shizuma.

178
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,000
That's one shocking name.

179
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,080
This facility is known
for cockroaches.

180
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,440
Oh, this facility favours
and specialises in cockroaches?

181
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,480
I think everyone is disgusted by it,

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,960
but there are cute ones
and pretty ones too.

183
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Right, I see.

184
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,760
If we see Shizuma's collection,

185
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,480
our bias towards cockroaches
may change a little.

186
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,040
- Here.
- It looks pretty clean in here.

187
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,920
The first one is
the Madagascar hissing cockroach.

188
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,600
This one hisses.

189
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
It hisses?

190
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,560
It forcefully expels air out of its
spiracle to make its hissing sound.

191
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
It hisses when it's threatened,
right?

192
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,600
Next one is Perispherus Pygmaea.

193
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,840
What? This is a cockroach?

194
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
It's like a roly-poly.

195
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
This species lives in Japan too.

196
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,960
It rolls into a ball
to protect itself from its enemy.

197
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,200
Can I take a look?

198
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,760
- Yes.
- The one who appeared on camera,

199
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,080
is assistant producer Hirata,
also known as "Mum."

200
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,120
I researched roly-poly when
I was a university student.

201
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,320
For real?
What's with your experience?

202
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,520
This is a cockroach?

203
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Wait, before you get to that,
you were researching roly-poly?

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,720
I collected over 300 roly-polys,

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
to research its sexual dimorphism.

206
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,400
For real?

207
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,440
Next one is Blaberus Giganteus.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,640
- What? This is a cockroach?
- Yes, it is.

209
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Its smell is very unique. It smells
like dried Shiitake mushrooms.

210
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,760
That's great.

211
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,840
Wow, it really smells
like Shiitake mushrooms.

212
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,000
When I found out about this smell,
I was so impressed.

213
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,880
- He was impressed?
- I was like, "It's Shiitake."

214
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
- It sure is.
- Yes.

215
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,720
When I see Shiitake mushrooms,
I think of this.

216
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
That's what you think of?

217
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
That's not cool.

218
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
But it doesn't taste like Shiitake
mushrooms when you eat it.

219
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
- What? You ate it before?
- I have.

220
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,280
I didn't have any stomach issues.

221
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,120
Right. Shizuma is fascinated
with cockroaches,

222
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
and yet he's allergic to them.

223
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,200
His hands get itchy.

224
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
Shizuma is fascinated
with studying cockroaches.

225
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,520
Cockroaches he had
previously discovered

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,560
in the Nansei Islands,

227
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,800
were acknowledged as a new variety
last November.

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,680
You can only find it on display
at this insect museum.

229
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,120
It was all about cockroaches
and farts.

230
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Not at all.

231
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,800
- We also requested it--
- We apologise.

232
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Not at all.

233
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,720
Next, she'll participate
in a bird show.

234
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,080
- She came to Kakegawa Kachoen.
- I've been there.

235
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,680
I think it's rare for any place
to offer a daily bird show.

236
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,960
She'll attempt to participate
in a show of predatory birds

237
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
with sharp talons and beaks.

238
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,960
A hawk will land on your hand.

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Its talons are sharp.

240
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,760
- Wait, do hawks have good vision?
- Yes, they do.

241
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,240
Then it can tell
these two colours apart?

242
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm wearing similar colours here.

243
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,480
It's fine.

244
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,160
The one to assist her is...

245
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
This is Yoshino.

246
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,360
- Yoshino?
- It's a girl.

247
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,560
I know a Yoshino.

248
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,480
Yoshino kind of looks like her.

249
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
They both have that smart look.

250
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,280
Please always make sure to stand

251
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,320
with your left shoulder
towards the hawk.

252
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
This is how you stand.

253
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,280
It's prohibited to face the hawk
from the front.

254
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,520
When you look into hawk's eyes,
they will take it as a threat.

255
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,520
You should never look into
the hawk's eyes

256
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,080
when it's resting on your arm.

257
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,800
I shouldn't do that.
I'm glad to know that.

258
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,720
Yoshino!

259
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,640
It may attack you if you don't learn
its nature properly.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,880
They won't peck your eyes
with their sharp beak, right?

261
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,400
It'll be fine,
they'll use their talons.

262
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,520
When they do it? That's scary!

263
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,960
Hawks tend to attack with their
talons to catch their prey.

264
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,960
So you don't have to worry about
them attacking you with their beak.

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,960
She will handle a falcon
and a secretary bird as well.

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,240
Now, the rare animal hunter's
bird show begins!

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,200
Hello!

268
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,200
- Good morning, everybody!
- That's great.

269
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,120
- I'm glad to have so many visitors.
- She has guests.

270
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you for being here
so early in the morning.

271
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,400
Are you all ready?

272
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,720
Number 73, are you ready?

273
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,040
Okay! Thank you very much.

274
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,680
The first bird I'm going to bring in
is this one!

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,160
Come!

276
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Okay! Thank you, Yoshino.

277
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,240
Since we are all here,
let's have her fly by all of you.

278
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,440
She flew quite close to you,

279
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,920
its Japanese name is Momoakanosuri.

280
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,920
It means its thighs are red,
and it flies low to the ground,

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
and that's why it's called
Momoakanosuri.

282
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,360
Imoto found a job she can do,

283
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
even if she quits
being an entertainer.

284
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,760
- That's great.
- Yoshino!

285
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,600
Come.

286
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,040
Next up is "Archery,"
a Lanner falcon.

287
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,520
She uses a lure to show
how it hunts.

288
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
Okay, come Archery!

289
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
There it is.

290
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,960
It dodged the first one.

291
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,440
It dodged the second one too.

292
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,800
And...

293
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,560
the third time... Archery!

294
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,840
Archery!

295
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
Where did it go?

296
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,960
There it is.

297
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,360
Got it!

298
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,160
What a great catch!

299
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
Last one is "Kick,"
a secretary bird.

300
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,520
It shows its famous characteristic
of kicking a snake.

301
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,640
- That's disgusting.
- It's upset.

302
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
Kick is here!

303
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,000
- It's kicking! That's it!
- It really kicks it.

304
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
That's it!

305
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,840
That's it! If you would take
a look at its head,

306
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,240
it focuses its kicks around
the snake's head.

307
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,920
It kicks to get it with one blow.

308
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,720
This would be a disaster if a person
is kicked by an accident.

309
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,840
Kick! Kick!

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Okay.

311
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,400
So you have these regular snakes,
but in Africa, they have cobras

312
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,160
that raise their head.
Then what do these birds do?

313
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,360
Please take a look.

314
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,160
Look, it's a cobra.

315
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,720
Its head is raised.

316
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Ah, it kicked the camera.
It kicked the GoPro.

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,960
GoPro is not your enemy.

318
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,080
Kick! Look, that's scary.
Wow! It jumped.

319
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,360
That was a high kick.

320
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,560
- It could kick that high?
- There! Nice kick!

321
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I made a couple of mistakes,
but I had a great time doing it.

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I used to admire the ladies who do
the dolphin and sea lion shows,

323
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,200
so I felt like my childhood dream
was fulfilled. I had fun.

324
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
Next, it's amazing kids in Shizuoka.

325
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,400
These are the members of a rope
skipping team, E-Jump Fuji.

326
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,320
They are experts who hold
two Guinness World Records.

327
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,640
Imoto's challenge
for this part is...

328
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,880
- High-speed long rope skipping.
- Oh wow.

329
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Ready...

330
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,720
That's fast.

331
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,080
That's fast!

332
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,520
They continue to skip rope quickly
in a figure-eight configuration.

333
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,200
They jumped 230 times in a minute,

334
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,520
to achieve a superhuman record.

335
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,400
This time, the challenge is to jump
for one minute.

336
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,600
No! No! No! That's harsh. What?

337
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,080
By the way, how fast
are they jumping right now?

338
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
About 180 times per minute.

339
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,680
It calculates to three jumps
per second.

340
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
This is how fast you have to jump
to call it "high-speed."

341
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,880
When I imagine myself being
in there, I only see problems.

342
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,160
You published
a book recently, right?

343
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,640
Yes, I published a book
called "Tanakara Tsubugai."

344
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,160
If you are successful
in this challenge,

345
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,840
we were thinking of giving it away
as a gift to all participants.

346
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,320
That's great.

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,080
I mean, I would love it if the kids
would read my book.

348
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920
And the fact that all the viewers
will see it on TV,

349
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,400
makes me happy as an author.

350
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
She'll start her practise now.

351
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,040
What's important with long-rope
skipping is the four-four rhythm.

352
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,280
You start counting three jumpers
before you,

353
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,760
Three, two, and you enter.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,480
You step into the rope and jump.
That's four counts.

355
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,400
So they're all counting
in their heads?

356
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,280
Yes, they are. When I say "enter,"
what I mean is...

357
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
So the ones swinging the rope
are called the turners.

358
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,760
You cross right next to this turner.

359
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,240
That is what we mean by "enter."

360
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
- I see. You go in at that angle?
- Yes.

361
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,520
You want to step in on cue.

362
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,160
Please land with your jumping foot.

363
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,480
So if you step in with your right,
you step in and jump.

364
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,920
- I see.
- Yes.

365
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,480
Okay.

366
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
- That's it. That's perfect.
- I see.

367
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,920
Let's start skipping!

368
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
Ready.

369
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,200
- Okay!
- Three, two, enter, and jump.

370
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
This is how fast 180 jumps
per minute is.

371
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
Okay, three, two, enter!

372
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,200
- Amazing!
- That's incredible.

373
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,720
Okay, three, two, enter!

374
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,120
This is no joke. This is hard!

375
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,840
This is... No...

376
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,200
Three, two, enter!

377
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,840
The rope hit Imoto's elbow
after she jumped,

378
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,080
and the jumper behind her got
caught in it and ended this round.

379
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Oh no!

380
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,160
The biggest issue here
is not about jumping, but...

381
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,800
You know...

382
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm sprinting right now,

383
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,520
but I can't keep up with them.

384
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,760
Three, two, enter!

385
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,040
She manages to keep up
for about 20 seconds,

386
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,520
at a pace of 180 jumps per minute.

387
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,160
- Okay! Applaud!
- That's amazing.

388
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,440
Amazing.

389
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,720
What's the trick?

390
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,400
I think my physical strength?

391
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,920
The more I do it, the more strength
I lose, so I'm losing power here.

392
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,600
I guess I'll have to get it done
in the first half.

393
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,280
So the first try is super critical.

394
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,280
It's super critical.

395
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,560
I'll get it done the first time.

396
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,760
Now, high-speed long-rope
skipping challenge!

397
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,840
Her critical first attempt.

398
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,520
Ready,

399
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
go!

400
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay, three, two, enter!

401
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,960
Okay, three, two, enter!

402
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,160
Imoto makes short turns
to maintain her strength.

403
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,560
Three, two, enter!

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,280
Okay, three, two, enter!

405
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
- Okay, three, two, enter!
- I'm impressed.

406
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
We can do it!

407
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay, three, two, enter!

408
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,880
Okay, three, two, enter!

409
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,760
Will she get it done the first time,
as she had claimed?

410
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,000
Three, two, enter!

411
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Okay, three, two, enter!

412
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,240
Okay, three, two, enter!

413
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,160
Almost!

414
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,080
Okay, three, two, enter!

415
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,040
- Wonderful!
- Amazing!

416
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
Okay, three, two, enter!

417
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,040
You almost had it.

418
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Did it hit my clothes at the end?

419
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,360
It hit you here as you were leaving.

420
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,120
You leave right after you jump,
but you were too tired to do it.

421
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,240
If you could run at the end...

422
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,480
You had two more seconds to go.

423
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,720
I could have done it,

424
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,520
but after this run...

425
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,880
I have to say...

426
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,680
doing another run

427
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,000
is too hard.

428
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,680
Now, I wish

429
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I had messed up earlier.

430
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,000
Failing at this point is...

431
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
As expected, her physical strength
diminishes after this run.

432
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,440
An endless death road continues...

433
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
"15th attempt"

434
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,440
"27th attempt"

435
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,760
It's so much slower!

436
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm sorry!

437
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,480
Their 34th attempt. They have
seven more seconds to go.

438
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,960
Now, the kids got caught.

439
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
No!

440
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,680
Honestly, they are...

441
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,920
Imoto, you're doing it perfectly.

442
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
- No! No! No!
- You're perfect.

443
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,760
- That was close!
- That was our mistake.

444
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,000
Coach Nishizawa couldn't forgive
the kids' lack of focus.

445
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,640
Oh no, they're being lectured.

446
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,880
You have to focus.

447
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,520
Why are you losing your focus
at the end? You messed up.

448
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
- It's all of you. Do you get it?
- Oh no.

449
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,360
You need to step it up.
It was your fault just now.

450
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,680
It was your fault for sure just now.
Imoto was doing it perfectly.

451
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
No, no.

452
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,400
When he puts it that way,
it adds so much more pressure.

453
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
Please stop, coach.

454
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
Make sure to get it done next time.

455
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
It's enough already.

456
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,440
Ayumu got caught in the rope.

457
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,760
He looks like the world is ending.

458
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,240
When Imoto saw that...

459
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,320
Look at him. I think it's that kid
with glasses.

460
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,000
His face is so...

461
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,480
It makes me want to cry.

462
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,680
Oh no. I'm going to cry.

463
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,320
When I see his face,
it makes me want to cry.

464
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,120
I mean, he... I don't know how many
times we jumped today,

465
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,600
but he only messed up
that one time just now.

466
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,000
He feels so responsible about it,

467
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,720
and his expression just now
is something else...

468
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,560
I feel really bad about it.

469
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,720
This is not something

470
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
he should be held responsible for.

471
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,000
Originally.

472
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,200
I feel really bad about it.

473
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,120
- He's under so much pressure.
- This must be hard.

474
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,640
Is he going to be okay?

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,560
This part was supposed to be used
to advertise her new book,

476
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
but unexpectedly, it became a drama
displaying tenacity in sports.

477
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,200
Failure is not an option anymore,
for Ayumu's sake.

478
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
- Go for it!
- Get it done!

479
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,960
Will they succeed?

480
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,280
- Let's do it!
- It'll be fine.

481
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
- Let's go!
- Yes!

482
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
Ready.

483
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,520
Okay, three, two, enter!

484
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,360
I feel really bad about this.

485
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,360
This is not something he should
be held responsible for.

486
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,800
Failure is not an option anymore,
for Ayumu's sake.

487
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,000
- Go for it!
- Get it done!

488
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,520
Will they succeed?

489
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,960
- Let's do it!
- It'll be fine.

490
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,480
- Let's go!
- Yes!

491
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,520
Ready.

492
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,040
Okay, three, two, enter!

493
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,040
- Okay, three, two, enter!
- You can do it!

494
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,960
Okay, three, two, enter!

495
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
Okay, three, two, enter!

496
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,640
Okay, three, two, enter!

497
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,080
- Okay, three, two, enter!
- 20 seconds have passed.

498
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,440
Okay, three, two, enter!

499
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,240
Okay, three, two, enter!

500
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
- Okay, three, two, enter!
- It feels so long.

501
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,920
- Okay, three, two, enter!
- A minute feels like forever.

502
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,800
Okay, three, two, enter!

503
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,240
20 seconds left.

504
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,640
- This is where it gets tougher.
- Okay, three, two, enter!

505
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,600
Okay, three, two, enter!

506
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
Okay, three, two, enter!

507
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
Okay, three, two, enter!

508
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
Okay, three, two, enter!

509
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,680
Yes!

510
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,920
Okay, three, two, enter!

511
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,920
Okay!

512
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,560
Amazing.

513
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,640
They are successful in high-speed
rope skipping for a minute.

514
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
They jumped 186 times!

515
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,520
If it weren't for COVID-19,
I'd hug everyone right now!

516
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,600
I know!

517
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,960
- Let's do an air hug!
- An air hug!

518
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,720
Air hug! Air hug!

519
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,480
Thank you so much.
I got worried half way through.

520
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,720
I was worried
about their expression.

521
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
Do you still like rope skipping?

522
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
- Yes, I love it.
- I'm glad to hear that.

523
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,680
Do you get scolded like that
all the time?

524
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,880
But what do you do
when that happens?

525
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
I'm not worried. I'm not worried.

526
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,840
- We do that.
- Why didn't you do that?

527
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,280
- What is that?
- So it's all okay.

528
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,440
You should worry a little.

529
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,760
Show that you're worried.

530
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,480
Thank you very much.

531
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,040
This is my book,
"Tanakara Tsubugai."

532
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,600
That's it for our 10th prefecture,
Shizuoka! We conquered it.

533
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
Let's move on. Asako, please.

534
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,320
Yes, next up is this!

535
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,680
Lotti Nakaoka's Qtube!

536
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,280
Yeah!

537
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,880
I went to Fukuoka, Kyushu this time.

538
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
I did a collaboration with

539
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760
a local high school volleyball team.

540
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,800
Oh no. Are you going to tie
your hair back again?

541
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,760
You're all too sensitive!

542
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,240
- You're going to try to act cool?
- No, this time I didn't do that.

543
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,440
Are you sure?

544
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
- I was serious.
- You were serious?

545
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
We all like to police around.

546
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,880
- It's fine?
- He'll be arrested.

547
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,800
They'll go "time of arrest,
so and so hour."

548
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,680
This world is full of YouTubers who
create and post interesting videos.

549
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
This project goes
on location with them,

550
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,000
to create a video
to make the whole world laugh.

551
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,680
This is...

552
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,400
QTube.

553
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,400
He headed to Fukuoka this time.

554
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,120
First, he will attempt
to do a boating technique,

555
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,920
going down the river at Yanagawa.

556
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
My impression of Yanagawa is...

557
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,120
I think I saw a movie with
Yanagawa when I was about 20.

558
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
I always wanted to visit this place.

559
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,120
I think it was "Tokyo Biyori."

560
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,640
It was directed by Naoto Takenaka.

561
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't think so.

562
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
Don't be so sure.

563
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm certain that they filmed
it in Yanagawa.

564
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,480
The scene where Miho Nakayama
is sleeping on a boat is beautiful.

565
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,640
I don't think so.

566
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
- It's in "Tokyo Biyori."
- Why are you so certain?

567
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,080
- I remember watching it.
- I remember "Tokyo Biyori."

568
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,560
It's a performance done
by Masuda the boatsman,

569
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,560
when he goes under the bridge.

570
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,120
It's low.

571
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
It's low.

572
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,040
Wow! What?

573
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
He pushes the boat with his foot

574
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,320
to make it go under the bridge,

575
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,000
- What's going on?
- and he climbs up the bridge.

576
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,920
What's going on?

577
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
There he is! Amazing!

578
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
This is the bridge
climbing performance.

579
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
Let's have you challenge this.

580
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,440
I think I can do it.

581
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,240
First, let's start at beginner level
at Takemon Bridge.

582
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,120
A long bamboo pole is used
to push the boat forward.

583
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,120
Okay.

584
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
- It looks great.
- What's important is

585
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,440
to have the boat go straight
while going under the bridge.

586
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,680
Okay!

587
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
- I'm sorry. I'm coming up there.
- He's going too fast.

588
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm coming up there.

589
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
Oh no!

590
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,480
- He crashed into the wall.
- He said "Oh no!"

591
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
It's cold.

592
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
Did I rush it?

593
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,600
You rushed it.

594
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
Next, an advanced level.

595
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,920
Josai Bridge is so difficult that
Masuda won't climb up that often.

596
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,560
It's high,

597
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,400
and there's nothing to hold on to

598
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,840
when I climb up.

599
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,320
- Will Nakaoka succeed?
- Come on!

600
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,760
- Go for it!
- You can do it!

601
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,760
Since the river is wide, it's easier
to let the boat go under.

602
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,400
What's left is whether he can
climb up the parapet that's high up.

603
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
Climb it!

604
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,920
- Go for it!
- He can do it.

605
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,720
Nakaoka climbed up,
with determination.

606
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,680
Go!

607
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,800
Now, he just has to get on the boat.

608
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,120
- Wait! Wait!
- Don't rush it.

609
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,480
- Wait!
- Jump on!

610
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,640
He sure is a first-class comedian.

611
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,640
He used everything he could here
to do this performance!

612
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,040
Wait!

613
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,120
- It's like that prankster show.
- Climbing up

614
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
went well.

615
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,360
- Darn it!
- Climbing up was...

616
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,960
- Climbing up was...
- That's great.

617
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,240
It's...

618
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,880
My lower body...

619
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,280
is going to tear!

620
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,600
Nakaoka wants to shower
as soon as possible...

621
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,080
The boat can't come back
without a pole.

622
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,320
What did you say?

623
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,960
A boat can't return without a pole.

624
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,560
They need a pole for the boat
to come back?

625
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,120
A puzzling mission of delivering
a pole to the boat gets assigned.

626
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
That's no joke.

627
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,880
Darn it!

628
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,600
That was so close.

629
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
That was close.

630
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,560
Why are you running so fast?

631
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
They said they need a pole
for the boat to return.

632
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,760
It's back!

633
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,240
Next up is a video that can be
created at a low cost.

634
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Nakaoka, the human compass.

635
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,640
Let's try it with a blackboard sheet
stuck on a wall.

636
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,080
I don't feel any pressure at all.

637
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
Should I carry that
for the heck of it?

638
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,960
"Should I carry that
for the heck of it?"

639
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,880
- Here I go!
- Can he draw a perfect circle?

640
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,320
Looking good.

641
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,680
Oh? It looks good to me.

642
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,400
- This is clean.
- So you can draw it?

643
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,120
I'm done.

644
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,680
It's good.

645
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,880
Amazing.

646
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
I did it.

647
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,160
You went unexpectedly slow.

648
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Did you want me to do it fast?

649
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I'll start over here, then.

650
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,280
He'll draw it faster now.

651
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,960
- I did it.
- That was impressive.

652
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,120
I drew another circle
of the same size.

653
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
That's amazing.

654
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,680
The next challenge is done
by a team of three.

655
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,880
Jumping through a hula-hoop.

656
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Three people form a line,

657
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,320
and everyone jumps through
a hula-hoop thrown by the lead.

658
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
Kokura Minami Gymnastics Club
will help out.

659
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,960
We have a special instructor
for you.

660
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,800
Which gymnast do you think of
when you think of North Kyushu?

661
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,720
Orakio?

662
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,240
- It's not Dangan Jackie.
- It's not Dangan Jackie?

663
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,680
Speaking of North Kyushu, it's U...

664
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,640
It can't be? During this season?

665
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,880
I was told that Coach Uchimura
is here?

666
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,840
It's not Uchimura.

667
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,640
It's not gymnast Uchimura.

668
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,160
This is Ryu Matsuo, who is two years
older than Kohei Uchimura.

669
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,960
I apologise. Nice to meet you.

670
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,680
Assistant director Fujimoto
will join in to try this challenge.

671
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,760
- Ready!
- Okay.

672
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,680
- Here I go!
- Okay.

673
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
Ready!

674
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,320
Ouch.

675
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

676
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,880
When this challenge is tried,

677
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
a hula-hoop actually hurts.

678
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,160
- Ouch!
- One more time.

679
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,640
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

680
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,440
Nakaoka takes the lead now.

681
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,480
I'll do this one.

682
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Ready!

683
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,760
- Ouch!
- It hurts.

684
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,960
I'm sorry.

685
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,840
It directly hits the crown
of Fujimoto's head.

686
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,520
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That would hurt.

687
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
Do you have something bigger
than this,

688
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
by any chance?

689
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,920
We do.

690
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,920
You do?

691
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,920
Wait.

692
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,520
It's very subtle.

693
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,680
The difference is subtle.

694
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,240
"Déjà-vu?"

695
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,120
I thought you had something
much bigger.

696
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,280
This is a subtle difference.

697
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,520
Do you have another one?

698
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,600
What are you doing here?

699
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
There it is!

700
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,280
It's a subtle difference.

701
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Challenge with a hula-hoop
that's slightly bigger.

702
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Here we go!

703
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,400
Then...

704
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,920
Ready!

705
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
We did it!

706
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,080
Didn't we do it?

707
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,240
It hit Fujimoto's back,
but they succeeded!

708
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,760
We did it!

709
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,680
Didn't we do it? Yes! We did it!

710
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
You know,

711
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,080
I seriously just made it through.
This is how I jumped.

712
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,160
That was a miracle.

713
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,760
- He's right.
- That's incredible!

714
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,600
Next, it's the world's
amazing tricks on video.

715
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,960
The next video is...
Why do you have the cue card out?

716
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,880
- It's common to have it for TV.
- That is true,

717
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,320
but I've never seen any script
or cue cards for this show.

718
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,720
I see. That sounds interesting.

719
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,360
I'll do my best!
Why would I say that?

720
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,800
Nakaoka, flipping on a kayak.

721
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
It will be taught by Kawazu,

722
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,280
who placed eighth
in freestyle canoe in Japan.

723
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,160
Amazing!

724
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,960
It looks super hard.

725
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,440
- He will use a small single kayak.
- That looks scary.

726
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
His feet will be fixed in place.

727
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,960
So the instructor will save him
immediately if he capsizes.

728
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,240
This is horrifying.

729
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,360
Being fixed in position is scary.

730
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,560
There are things
you shouldn't do in a river,

731
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,760
- but this is a pool, so...
- Is it fine?

732
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,240
Let's do this!

733
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,040
I trust you!

734
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,320
He is all hyped up
to try his first attempt!

735
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,720
Let's go!

736
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,600
He capsized.

737
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,800
That's scary!

738
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,280
- That's so scary.
- That's no joke.

739
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I quit!

740
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,320
I quit! I quit!
This is too scary!

741
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm quitting!

742
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,720
Nakaoka is discouraged
at the fastest rate ever.

743
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,520
Of all the videos
I have done so far,

744
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,960
that was the fastest I've given up.

745
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,480
This is the fastest, right?

746
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,440
Comparing the probability
of being able to do this,

747
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,560
and

748
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
the probability of me dying,

749
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,360
I think the probability of me dying
is actually higher.

750
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,120
Degawa said that we don't have
the right to quit.

751
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
You have the right.

752
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
What do we do?

753
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,880
I'll do my best! Stop that!

754
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,280
"Nakaoka, I'll do my best!"

755
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,680
I can't do my best.

756
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,760
I can't read that cue card anymore.

757
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,120
Next, he'll attempt this challenge
at a popular Instagenic spot.

758
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,400
Next, he'll attempt this challenge
at a popular Instagenic spot.

759
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,160
Hello! It's Lotti Nakaoka here!

760
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,040
I'm here

761
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,560
In Toyomae,

762
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,560
Fukuoka.

763
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
"Buzen"

764
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,600
What...

765
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,880
am I doing right now?

766
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,760
The correct answer is...

767
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,880
- I am sitting on a gigantic chair!
- That's something else.

768
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
What he will challenge
using this gigantic chair is...

769
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,200
Rebounding bottle catch.

770
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,200
He will bounce the ball
and catch the rebounding bottle.

771
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,960
- It's the Galilean cannon theory.
- It's going to bounce back up.

772
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,760
An object on top gains the momentum
of the rebounding ball,

773
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,640
to bounce higher
than its original position.

774
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,680
If you're unable to catch it,

775
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
this thing will shoot out
of your back.

776
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,080
There it is!

777
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,680
That thing misfires!

778
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,920
This is the new and improved
steaming hot PET bottle rocket.

779
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,920
Improved?

780
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
A string attached to the trigger

781
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,360
on the original one
was two metres long,

782
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
but this one is twice as long,
at four metres.

783
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,640
I don't think its length
has anything to do with it.

784
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,080
As long as the ball is dropped
straight down,

785
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,560
the bottle is sure to come back up.

786
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
I can do this.

787
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,680
It all depends on whether Nakaoka
can catch it or not.

788
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,480
If he fails, a steaming bottle
rocket will launch from his back.

789
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,600
I think I can do this in one go.

790
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,120
- Here I go!
- Will he succeed like he claimed?

791
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
One, go!

792
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,120
Come on!

793
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,600
Hot! It's hot!

794
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,320
It's hot!

795
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,880
What kind of a set-up is this?

796
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,160
Unfortunately, Nakaoka failed.

797
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,200
- It's hot!
- That's great.

798
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,960
That's the best.

799
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,280
Now, please watch this artistic
video of two falling bottles.

800
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,760
I think those super-hot bottles

801
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,120
- are great.
- It came back!

802
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,720
Now, it goes that way!

803
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
That's great.

804
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,000
Soichi, that's great.

805
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,200
This part is the best.

806
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,160
- That looks hot!
- Amazing.

807
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,600
- That's great.
- That looks hot.

808
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,040
This is great. Man, this is great.

809
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,240
This is horrible for my scalp.

810
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,080
My back can endure this,
but not my scalp.

811
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
- Seriously.
- It's horrible for the scalp.

812
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,320
It's smooth on the outside.

813
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,360
What?

814
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,920
Your hair is smooth on the outside,
but the centre part is soggy.

815
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Don't describe it like a Takoyaki.

816
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,400
He'll collaborate with a local
volleyball team for the final one.

817
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,520
Is he going to behave?

818
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,560
The last video is the second one of
"Trying to Act Cool Nakaoka" series.

819
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,680
- What?
- Trying to act cool?

820
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,120
You're talking about the volleyball
thing I did before, right?

821
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,960
It's not like I was trying
to act cool that time either.

822
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,080
It just so happens
that I looked good.

823
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,160
He will collaborate
with Kitakyushu High School's

824
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,080
women's volleyball team.

825
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,160
It's a strong team that frequently
competes at national competitions.

826
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
The first-class comedian
makes his appearance!

827
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,120
Look at them!

828
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,400
Everyone at Kitakyushu High School!

829
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Thank you for having me here today.

830
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,760
"Eek"

831
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,680
- I like this.
- He's at it again.

832
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,040
- Volleyball simultaneous shooting.
- It just feels so great.

833
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
Three of them will set the ball

834
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,040
at the basket simultaneously
to make a shot.

835
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,160
First, he'll challenge with three
volleyballs, like the video.

836
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,040
- Don't say it's impossible.
- Nakaoka exhibits leadership

837
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,280
- when it comes to club activities.
- Think that you can make a shot.

838
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,800
Let's get it done now!

839
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,680
- Yeah!
- Yeah...

840
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,120
No! This won't do! That "Yeah"
just now is unacceptable!

841
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,960
- Ready!
- Will they get three shots?

842
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,560
Whoa! Did mine go in?

843
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,720
Nakaoka is the only one
who made the shot.

844
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,760
Do you get it now?
My mentality is different here.

845
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,200
But when it's played in slow motion,

846
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Nakaoka's ball is blocking
the other two shots.

847
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,200
- Okay.
- Now, Nakaoka

848
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,800
ties his hair back.

849
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,880
Again?

850
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,480
Okay.

851
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm serious here.

852
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Let's do this.

853
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,400
- Ready!
- This challenge requires control,

854
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,440
timing, and trajectories of all
three participants to be in sync,

855
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,120
for it to be successful.

856
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,560
They've been doing this
for an hour now.

857
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,760
What?
- I want a one-liner joke...

858
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,520
You want a one-liner joke
for a break?

859
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,120
They're so tough.

860
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,360
- Teacher!
- Yes?

861
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,000
Your students are being weird.

862
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,160
Please.

863
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,440
I've never done a one-liner joke.

864
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
I'll do a charming Kabuki actor.

865
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,080
"Poop"

866
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,480
Alright! Let's pretend like
it never happened.

867
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,880
That's when it happened.

868
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,080
Let's go!

869
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,640
Ready!

870
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,840
They made three shots,
simultaneously!

871
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,000
What do we do?

872
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,640
Is three enough?

873
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,040
That was just practice.

874
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,520
That wasn't for practice!

875
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,760
That was the actual thing.

876
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
Those three shots were amazing.

877
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,800
But your joke was seriously bad,

878
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,320
and if I edit out your joke,
it won't make any sense.

879
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,920
Then shall we try for four?

880
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,160
It was amazing just now.
Let's go for five.

881
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,520
Five?

882
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
Can you do five?

883
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,320
So now, they'll challenge
making five shots.

884
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,080
Let's go!

885
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,680
However, when they try it,

886
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,040
throwing five is significantly
harder than three.

887
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,720
It sure is difficult.

888
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,360
They tried it for two hours
with no success.

889
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,640
Now, for self-awareness purposes,

890
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,600
let's raise our hand
if we miss a shot.

891
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,320
- Yes.
- Okay.

892
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,640
- Let's be strict with ourselves.
- Yes.

893
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,560
- Focus.
- Nakaoka gives a pep talk.

894
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,560
- Let's go!
- Then immediately after that...

895
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,880
- Wow!
- Amazing!

896
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,040
Captain's bitter mistake.

897
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Currently, Nakaoka is scheming
to turn this into a laugh.

898
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,200
You know what?

899
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,360
This is not the time

900
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,320
to blame someone
for making a mistake.

901
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,240
One person's mistake
is everyone's mistake.

902
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,400
Okay! Let's inspire one another!

903
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,200
Failed.

904
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,800
They've been on location
for four hours.

905
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,440
The number of attempts made
was 355 times.

906
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,800
Nakaoka performed his joke
five times.

907
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,240
Volley-rina.

908
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,120
Someone say, "Hey! You shoplifted."

909
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,720
Hey, you shoplifted!

910
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Did you see that?

911
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,880
- Okay.
- Let's do our best.

912
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,600
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

913
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,240
- Ready!
- Everyone in the gymnasium

914
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,520
gets united for success.

915
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,000
That's close.

916
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,560
- Come on!
- Let's go!

917
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,760
That's great.

918
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,000
Is it happening soon?

919
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,320
It's soon.

920
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,240
Let's focus this one time.

921
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,080
Let's get it in!

922
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,080
- Yeah!
- Alright, let's do this!

923
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,960
Let's do it!

924
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,280
And then...

925
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,240
- It's happening?
- No way!

926
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,600
They successfully made
five simultaneous shots!

927
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,560
Amazing!

928
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,040
- Amazing!
- Amazing.

929
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,960
Go!

930
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,480
- We did it!
- We did it!

931
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,240
- We did it!
- Amazing.

932
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,240
It went in beautifully.

933
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,600
- It really did!
- However,

934
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
excited Nakaoka makes
an unexpected comment.

935
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,520
Let's do six!

936
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,080
Okay! Let's do six
and intimidate them all!

937
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,640
What do you think?

938
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm not wearing my glasses,
so I don't see your faces clearly.

939
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,120
The scenario was, you get in
five shots, you then get excited,

940
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,920
and I would say,
"Do you want to try six?"

941
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,480
Then it would end with you saying,
"No way!"

942
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,760
But you looked all enthusiastic

943
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,640
and proclaimed, "Let's do six!"

944
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,800
As a result,
this is how it ended up,

945
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,480
and I feel bad for everyone.

946
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,480
Unknowingly,

947
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,920
I might have tried to act cool.

948
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,560
That's it! Thank you Kitakyushu
High School volleyball team.

949
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
- His success was incredible.
- That was incredible.

950
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,640
It's just that when he took his
glasses off, he was pushing it.

951
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,440
He tied his hair back
before he took off his glasses.

952
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,480
I was thinking about
arresting him there.

953
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,240
What was that all about?

954
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,560
- Well, you know...
- "What was that all about?"

955
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
- "What was that all about?"
- Why did you tie your hair back?

956
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,840
What was that all about?

957
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,320
You gave up on the kayak
after just one attempt,

958
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,800
but you didn't give up
on volleyball.

959
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,440
You had the nerve to say,
"Let's do six!"

960
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,800
Then you should have attempted
to do the kayak thing 50 times!

961
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,840
He's right!
