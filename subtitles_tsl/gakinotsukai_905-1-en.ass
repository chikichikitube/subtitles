Comment: 0,0:00:52.08,0:00:53.25,Matsumoto,,0,0,0,,NOTE: Matsumoto says "it's really SAMUI", which in japanese is used both for "cold" (weather) and "lame". He's refering to Murakami's Classrooms, which are lame to him. They think he's talking about the weather. So he says that he meant Murakami is SAMUI, but the weather too.
