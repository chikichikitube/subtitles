Do not attempt to reenact
any of the activities performed.

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,930
The start of the battle
grows closer and closer.

5
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,833
Here, at the foot of sacred Mount Fuji,

6
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,436
Hamada's and Junior's armies
get ready for battle

7
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,571

both armies' battle cars
are running full throttle.

11
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,116
They are all heading
straight to the battlefield.

00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,186
Now you can see the battlefield.

13
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,789
On this battlefield,

14
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,291
foot soldiers
willing to fight to the death

15
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,627
will battle each other
in their battle cars.

16
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,030
There's an eerie silence here now,

17
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,399
but soon,
it will turn into a scene of carnage.

18
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,412
Wow, that's a quick start.
No, that's so dangerous.

19
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,616
He drives straight into him.

20

the side of that car.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,354
Die!

He drives into the back of the car
and pushes and pushes.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,728
Go!

24
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,465
Oh, he's going backwards.
He must be terrified.

25
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,266
Now, fly!

26
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,674

A new castle appears
at the foot of Mount Fuji,

30
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,000
seemingly built overnight.

31
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,202
Junior Castle

32
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,706
A castle that's gorgeously decorated,

33
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,875
beautiful and brilliant.

34
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,246

Brave, highly intelligent,
and full of speed and aggressiveness.

45
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,950
Chihara Junior's army

46
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,452

the three-point seat belt,

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,361

61
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,029
these cars were commonly referred to
as flying bricks.

Thank you very much, Master!

79
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,712
What is this? What did you do that for?

00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,347
You're our master, aren't you?
You're our master.

I chose it especially for you.

94
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,746
Thank you so much.

95
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,348

were Navigators.

155
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,346

pulls a two-and-a-half-ton monster.

157

He looks like a man,
but has the heart of a monster

173
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,570
He's a beast wearing human skin.

174
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,338
You're wonderful.

175
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,706
Hamada's lover
Seiko from Amako Inter

176
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,644
He uses women as his playthings
in the castle.

177
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,746
Hamada is a pervert from Osaka.

178
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,851
God, he has bad taste in women.

179
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,619
He goes for anything that moves.

180
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:13,387
Hamada Army's Foot Soldier,
Seiji Chihara

181
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,422
It feels so good.

182
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,323
Master.

183
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,124
Oh...

184
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,426
Hamada's Army - Ninja
Masaki Sata

185
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,496
Say what?

186
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,400
That Chihara Junior has built a castle!

187
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,436
No way!

188
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,204
Seiji.

189
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,707
Did you hear
what your little brother has done?

190
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,676
Yes, sir.

191
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,845
We're going to go take his castle,
do you hear me?

192
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,646
Get ready.

193
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:40,747
Yes, Master.

194
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,115
No way!

195
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:47,321
It's war!

196
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,294
This was the way
Hamada's army fought its battles,

197
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,330
following a win-at-all-costs strategy.

198
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,932
He's sneaky and vulgar,

199
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,368
and a complete and utter sadist.

200
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,708
Hamada's fleet of battle cars
doesn't look flashy.

201
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,510
Highly functional cars,

202
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,379
all primarily manufactured in Japan.

203
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,485
Through Hamada's dictatorial leadership,

204
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,288
his men have been trained
never to disobey his orders.

205
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:25,392
They're a bunch of extremists willing
to risk their lives for their master.

206
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,129
Master Hamada.

207
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,365
Junior's army
has a total of eight battle cars.

208
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,133
We are at a bit of a disadvantage.

209
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,302
We're two cars short.

210
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,203
Yes.

211
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,504
I have no choice.

212
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,040
Let's go with that plan.

213
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,445
The day of the battle has arrived.

214
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,515
Hamada's plan
to add to his fleet of battle cars

215
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,916
has now begun in earnest.

216
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,489
Hamada is two battle cars short.

217
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,558
His plan to add to his fleet
was so devious,

218
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,193
it was hard to believe.

219
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,866
It's the first time that I bought a car.
First time.

220
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,168
It's only been a month
since I came to Tokyo.

221
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,503
I'm so jealous.

222
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,805
I haven't even told my mom.

223
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:12,539
Really?

224
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,274
I haven't told her that I bought a car.

225
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,175
Seiko of Amako Inter
Nagisa of Amako Inter - Kanako Kadowaki

226
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:15,942
Really?

227
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,244
Because she'll get worried.

228
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,512
I guess.

229
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,780
She'll go, "Why so soon?

230
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,548
"It's only been a month
since you've come to Tokyo."

231
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,689
I saw this car on the road and I liked it,

232
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,492
so I looked it up on the Internet.

233
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,164
I checked out all the specs
on the car info website.

234
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,632
Yoshimasa Iwasaki of Plus Minus
Nana Yamada

235
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,401
I'd been hemming and hawing for a while.

236
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,370
Then I finally found this car.

237
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:47,207
It's been customized the way I like it.

238
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,713
We're arriving at Ebina...

239
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,981
We're here at Ebina.

240
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,416
We're at Ebina.

241
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,019
Is this a brand-new car?

242
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,054
No, it's secondhand.

243
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,889
Really? It still looks so new.

244
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,058
The dealer gave me a really good deal.

245
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,059
Wow.

246
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,128
He was an amazing dealer.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,602
It feels good
driving with the windows down.

248
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:16,736
Feeling the breeze.

249
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,339
If you saw this car on the road...

250
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,109
It's great, right?

251
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,477
It looks so cool.

252
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,078
-Yeah.
-Somewhere near the...

253
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:25,846
SUSONO
EXIT THRU TRAFFIC

254
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,180
What's going on?

255
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,215
Hamada Army's Foot Soldier
Kunikazu Katsumata

256
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,216
Everything is going well, Master.

257
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,750
-We're short of two cars.
-No problem. We're handling it.

258
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,751
It's all okay.

259
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,453
Currently, the first car
is heading this way.

260
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,454
We're going to use Amako Inter's car.

261
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,989
Battle Car Hunting Strategy 1 - Lure
Nagisa's car by filming a fake TV show

262
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,125
Amako Inter thinks they're filming
a TV segment called Driving around Tokyo.

263
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,026
They'll arrive here very soon.

264
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,528
So we're duping them, right?

265
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,629
That's right.

266
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,930
I feel sorry for them.

267
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:44,998
They know absolutely nothing.

268
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,867
It's the first time
they got their own show, right?

269
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,168
-Yes.
-Yes.

270
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:48,902
That's right.

271
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,004
So Nagisa's gone and bought a car

272
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,439
just for that show.

273
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,241
-Seriously?
-Yes.

274
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,909
-Really?
-She bought a car.

275
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,578
-She's really coming in her own car?
-In her own car.

276
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,113
She still has a loan on it, too.

277
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,149
She hasn't paid it off yet.

278
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,517
She only paid the deposit.

279
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,020
She was supposed to pay off the loan
bit by bit during that series.

280
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:07,954
Is that right?

281
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,322
She was going to use the money
she was getting paid to do the show.

282
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,123
Wow.

283
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,491
She will be so excited and happy
when she turns up here.

284
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,560
-Oh, well. We had no choice.
-Yes.

285
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,462
It's her darling little car.

286
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,363
Two months ago

287
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,699
The seeds of this plan
were sown two months ago.

288
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,470
Tokyo Drive!

289
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,074
The first filming is going to cover
Nagisa's first car purchase.

290
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,109
Yay!

291
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,977
It's amazing.

292
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:31,912
Fake Show Planning Sheet
"Amako Inter's Tokyo Drive"

293
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,848
Amako Inter's Tokyo Drive is a fake show

294
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,751
that Hamada's army made up.

295
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,485
Fake Show Planning Sheet

296
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,219
Show begins with Nagisa of Amako Inter
purchasing a new car in Tokyo.

297
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:39,953
(Nagisa will be liable
to pay off the car loan personally)

298
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,987
The conditions for appearing in this show

299
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,356
were for Nagisa to personally purchase
a car with her own money.

300
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,558
Plus...

301
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,594
What? I told all of my relatives.

302
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,361
Seiko of Amako Inter

303
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,163
Nagisa's going to have a meltdown
if she finds out.

304
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:51,998
Stabs partner in the back
to be part of Hamada's army

305
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,166
The army had drawn in

306
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,602
Nagisa's comedy partner Seiko
on the plan at an early stage.

307
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,003
It's a foolproof plan.

308
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,739
When you buy a car

309
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,474
-with your own money...
-Yes.

310
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,742
...you take really good care of it.

311
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,077
Yeah, you'll treasure it.

312
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,745
You'll want to keep it clean and tidy.

313
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,648
I'm going to buy my own car
for the first time in my life.

314
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,450
Wow, there are lots of different types.

315
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,752
Firstly, Nagisa will purchase a car
with her own money.

316
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,753
Blue Auto, Yokosuka City

317
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,156
Here, she falls in love
with a particular car.

318
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,958
We'll ask the dealer.

319
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,092
What's the model of this car?

320
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,594
That is a Nissan Fuga.

321
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,528
Fuga.

322
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,896
This car is considered
a Japanese luxury car.

323
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,565
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1680kg

324
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,299
Wow.

325
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,068
Wow, it's amazing.

326
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,135
I like it a lot.

327
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,637
It's really great.

328
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,974
It's really similar to the car

329
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,875
that my ex-boyfriend had,

330
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,744
-so it feels really familiar.
-I see.

331
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,779
It feels natural and comfortable.

332
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,615
If you buy today, you get a discount.

333
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,283
It's yours for 350,000 yen
instead of 500,000.

334
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,451
-Really? 350,000?
-Yes.

335
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,919
-If I decide today?
-Yes.

336
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:46,653
Of course.

337
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,554
Whoa.

338
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,922
I'll take this one.

339
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,190
Thank you very much.

340
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,659
I really have to fill in the contract
and everything.

341
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,061
Nagisa purchases the Fuga
without a second thought,

342
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,930
drawn in by the discount.

343
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:57,831
BLUE AUTO CO. LTD.

344
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,699
I wanted to drive it home.

345
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,702
I don't want anyone else to touch it.

346
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,104
I understand.

347
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,305
It belongs to me now.

348
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,009
And two weeks later...

349
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,910
Have a look at this.

350
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,178
-What?
-See the wheel?

351
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:12,979
The Delivery of the Nissan Fuga

352
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,415
The wheel used to be silver,
but now it's black.

353
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,916
It's perfect for you, right?

354
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,220
The Fuga that used to ooze luxury

355
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,956
has been pimped
according to Nagisa's tastes.

356
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,891
Light covers and front grill,

357
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,259
and the wheels have been painted black.

358
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:26,993
Please note that this car
meets the safety standards

359
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,727
of the Road Trucking Vehicle Act (Japan).

360
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,364
The car has been customized to suit
Nagisa's rather questionable tastes.

361
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,634
Your first drive.

362
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,971
Whoa.

363
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,474
This is amazing.

364
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,144
It's really running!

365
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,713
How did you feel on your first drive?

366
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,747
Amazing.

367
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,016
I've never been so happy.

368
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,217
-Seriously?
-Yes.

369
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,952
-I really love it.
-That's good.

370
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,587
I'm so glad and...

371
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,323
-Happy?
-I wanted to...

372
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,258
I want to tell my mom I bought a car.

373
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,726
I want to let her know.

374
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,529
And the day of the battle arrives.

375
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,598
This meant the first episode
of Amako Inter's Tokyo Drive

376
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,833
was also going to be shot today.

377
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,734
Amako Inter's Tokyo Drive
The filming of the first episode

378
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,902
Hey, hey, hey!

379
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,137
Watch where you're driving.

380
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:15,542
Today's destination is Susono,
near Mount Fuji.

381
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,477
Seriously? Where the hell is that?

382
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,481
This is supposed to be a show about
going for a nice drive with a guest star

383
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,782
and talking about
the stylish lifestyle in Tokyo...

384
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,683
Hamada's Army - Ninja
Kanako Kadowaki

385
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,452
The guest star Kanako Kadowaki

386
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,320
is part of Hamada's army,
assigned to lure Nagisa.

387
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,154
What?

388
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,289
I'd like to see it.

389
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,391
You'd never want to scratch it, right?

390
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,525
No, I'd hate that.

391
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,259
I know.

392
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,595
I don't even want anyone to make a mess
by eating snacks in the car.

393
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,831
You love it that much?

394
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:38,798
2 Hours Later

395
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,901
Nagisa doesn't know yet that
she and the Fuga would end up like this.

396
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,305
No way. You can't do that to me.

397
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,940
Oh, my God, I'm so scared.

398
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,644
They're supposed to meet up
with a secret guest star

399
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,713
for the fake show
Nagisa thinks they're filming

400
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,148
at Susono near Mount Fuji.

401
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,985
Now we're meeting up
with the secret guest star.

402
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,286
Yeah, we're going to the meeting point?

403
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,421
That's right.

404
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,058
This is so exciting.

405
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,659
-I know.
-I really don't know who it is.

406
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,694
I wonder who it is.

407
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,229
Who do you think it is?

408
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,633
We have to turn onto this narrow road.

409
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,601
Okay.

410
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,303
Here we go.

411
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,975
There are so many people.

412
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,544
Okay.

413
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,246
Ready?

414
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,216
It looks really scary.

415
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,687
I'm so scared.

416
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,556
What's going on?

417
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,860
Sata, please guide them here.

418
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:41,694
Yes, sire.

419
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,129
It's such a lovely car.

420
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,598
It's a nice car.
She just bought it, right?

421
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,766
She washed it as well.

422
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,035
Oh, no way. No way, no way.

423
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,170
She's laughing.

424
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,704
She must be happy to see you.

425
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,872
She's got a leopard print cover
on the steering wheel.

426
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,107
This is so scary.

427
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,575
Let's get out.

428
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,443
What?

429
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,413
Come on out.

430
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,182
How are you, Nagisa?

431
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,049
Come over here.

432
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,350
Wow.

433
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,552
What are you up to?

434
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,222
We were filming a show called Tokyo Drive.

435
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,056
Uh-huh...

436
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,091
It's the first time
we've had our own show.

437
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:12,959
It's going to be shown on Amazon.

438
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,761
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

439
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,330
And the conditions were

440
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,798
that I buy my own car.

441
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:19,699
I see.

442
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,867
So I went and...

443
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,101
You bought the car?

444
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,403
How much did it cost?

445
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,438
Total was about 500,000 yen.

446
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,306
Wow.

447
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,407
The deposit...

448
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,608
500,000 yen in total?

449
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:32,045
I borrowed the deposit of 100,000 yen
from Yoshimoto Finance.

450
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,413
You borrowed the 100,000 yen?

451
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,414
It looks great.

452
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,281
You borrowed your deposit amount too?

453
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:36,549
Yes, all of it.

454
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,117
You borrowed 100,000 yen from your Agency.

455
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:38,852
Look here...

456
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,153
It's so shiny.

457
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,988
Look at your steering wheel.

458
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,389
Leopard print.

459
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,158
It's a leopard print
steering wheel cover.

460
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,025
They modified it just for me.

461
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,193
Looks so clean.

462
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,629
It's the perfect car for you, Nagisa.

463
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,064
I love leopard print, yes.

464
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,398
Looks so new.

465
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,833
-Look at the rear.
-Is it all leopard print?

466
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,768
There's a sticker of our show Tokyo Drive.

467
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,536
On the back?

468
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,605
Wow. A sticker for your own show.

469
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,739
Wow.

470
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,944
I need to work hard
to pay off the debt for this car.

471
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:05,778
I see.

472
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,214
You need to make Tokyo Drive
a popular show.

473
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,549
-Yes.
-Hey, Nagisa.

474
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,050
Do you know what we do here?

475
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,652
Do you know why we're here?

476
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,121
Well, we've been told

477
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,590
that we're welcoming
a special guest star for our show.

478
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,692
What, you knew?

479
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,660
That's the reason?

480
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,495
That's why you're not so surprised.

481
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,731
No, I'm scared to death.

482
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:25,832
Why?

483
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,234
You didn't expect us?

484
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,770
Why are you afraid?

485
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,005
You didn't expect
such a big star to be here?

486
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,042
I'm shaking at the knees.

487
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,779
-The three of you, come with me.
-Yes.

488
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,481
She's very lucky.

489
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,483
We can use that car.

490
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,385
-Yes, looks good.
-We should use it.

491
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,086
It's almost new.

492
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,688
I think it's just been serviced, too.

493
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,190
The tires and the rims look sturdy too.

494
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,058
Very strong.

495
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,792
Top class.

496
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,927
Why are there four special guests?

497
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,995
-Then it's decided.
-Yes.

498
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,630
-Decision made.
-Decided.

499
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,398
Let's go.

500
00:19:58,965 --> 00:19:59,632
Well done.

501
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,367
-You've done a great job.
-You've passed.

502
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,402
What do you mean?

503
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,570
Well done.

504
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,371
I've decided to make you
one of my foot soldiers.

505
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,205
It's decided.

506
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,373
Foot soldier?

507
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,575
On to the next stage.

508
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,976
-Next stage?
-Yes.

509
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,411
-Congratulations.
-Congrats.

510
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,412
What's going on?

511
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,748
I'm really scared. Please don't touch me.

512
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,985
Did you think he'd snap your neck?

513
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,821
Please stand a safe distance away from me.

514
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,891
You're scheming something, aren't you?

515
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,093
Of course not.

516
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,094
Sorry we're late.

517
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,062
Really sorry.

518
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,830
What are you doing?

519
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,465
What is this?

520
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,134
You've been duped, Nagisa. Dumb-ass.

521
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,102
Dumb-ass.

522
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,570
Do you want me to smack you?

523
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,841
What are you saying?

524
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:46,045
We'd never get our own show
just like that.

525
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:46,846
Yes.

526
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,182
Why? I bought the car and everything.

527
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,484
That's right. That's right.

528
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,218
Of course.

529
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,886
The stories you told us in the car,

530
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,188
they weren't that funny.

531
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,157
I thought so too.

532
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,459
You didn't strike up a good conversation?

533
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,660
Not really.

534
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,629
Come on. You were enjoying yourself.

535
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:03,997
-Nagisa.
-Yes.

536
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,466
You never had your own show.

537
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,334
Why not?

538
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,237
You're going to become a Sentosha
in Hamada's army.

539
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,972
-That's right.
-What's a Sentosha?

540
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,241
If you didn't have this car, you wouldn't
be allowed into Hamada's army.

541
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,042
That's right.

542
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
Why can't I join if I didn't have a car?

543
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,812
That's the way it works.

544
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,280
It generally works that way.

545
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,548
I told you, it's called Sentosha.

546
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,282
Yes.

547
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,917
I've been wondering about that.

548
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,986
-I'm worried...
-You like battles, right?

549
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:32,892
Amagasaki's Reckless Magical Girl,
Nagisa of Amako Inter

550
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,094
Nissan Fuga
New car price approx. 5.7 million yen

551
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,530
Nagisa has entered this battle
with her own car.

552
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,399
This is an executive-class car

553
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,968
that was developed to take over
from the Nissan Cedric and Gloria.

554
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,503
This GT model is a sports car

555
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:47,940
that runs on a 3.5-liter engine
that generates 280 horsepower.

556
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,882
I was having so much fun
driving on the freeway.

557
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,917
Talking about lots of things.

558
00:21:58,751 --> 00:21:59,686
So scary.

559
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,222
Where's the other car?

560
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,023
He'll explain.

561
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,958
-Yes.
-Master Hamada.

562
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,160
For this next car,

563
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,228
we've organized a TV program.

564
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,697
The contestants will go
from one Service Area to the next,

565
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,265
eating various gourmet foods at each stop.

566
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,301
It's called SA1 Grand Prix.
It's a fake show.

567
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,669
-Another fake show?
-Yes.

568
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,472
The driver will bring his beloved vehicle.

569
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,708
Currently, Iwahashi from the comedy duo
Plus Minus is heading this way.

570
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,810
He'll be here soon.

571
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,011
Sentosha hunting plan 2
Lure Iwahashi's car through a fake TV show

572
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,546
Looks like he's having
a lot of fun filming so far.

573
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:27,747
Of course he is.

574
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,316
He's been told both Seiji and I
will be doing the show with him.

575
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,084
I see.

576
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,352
He just thinks we're filming
in a different location.

577
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,788
We're supposed to be competing
with one another.

578
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,522
I understand.

579
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,591
The point of the show
is that you're using your own car.

580
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:39,792
-Today, we'll be going on a trip...
-Yes.

581
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,861
-...in Mr. Iwahashi's beloved car.
-Yes.

582
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:42,595
Hamada's Army - Ninja
Nana Yamada

583
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:43,496
Now Mr. Iwahashi,
what kind of car do you drive?

584
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,765
Yes, this is my car.

585
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,166
Wow, such a cool car.

586
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,468
It's a Honda Crossroad.

587
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,503
Engine 1.8L SOHC / 140 hp / 4WD / Weight 1480kg

588
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,437
It looks so cool.

589
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,172
Isn't it cute?

590
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:53,973
So cool.

591
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,309
It's both stylish and cute
at the same time.

592
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,078
It's the best car ever.

593
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,246
"Fake Show Planning Sheet"
"SA-1 Grand Prix"

594
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,148
SA-1 Grand Prix is also a fake show

595
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,219
that Hamada's army had made up
to secure another battle car.

596
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:07,954
I'll dig in.

597
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,189
The participants
will drive their own cars,

598
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,624
going from one Service Area to another
as a gourmet.

599
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,792
After they eat various items on the menu,

600
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:13,760
Great rice!

601
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,827
they must pick what belongs
on the top five most popular foods

602
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:15,561
at these Service Areas.

603
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,296
It's not the most fascinating show
you've ever seen.

604
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:19,866
Is it hot?

605
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,400
It's hot.

606
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,704
This car feels so smooth and comfortable.

607
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,038
I know, right?

608
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:26,973
Yes.

609
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,909
You know, as time passes,

610
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,277
these kinds of cars become rare.

611
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,179
It's not about the money,
it's worth so much more.

612
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,114
-It means a lot to you?
-That's right.

613
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,651
I want to keep it well maintained.

614
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,387
I really want to drive it
for a very long time.

615
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,655
A very long time?

616
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,924
Yeah, my wife loves this car as well.

617
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:45,858
Is that so?

618
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:46,993
Yeah.

619
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:47,927
2 Hours Later

620
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,996
It was his beloved car full of memories.

621
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,364
But two hours later,

622
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,765
this will happen to it.

623
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,577
Seiji, who is supposed to be appearing
on the same TV program,

624
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,579
tries contacting Iwahashi on the phone.

625
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,914
I go to golf in it...

626
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,981
There's a call coming through.

627
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:09,982
A call?

628
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,017
-Yes, a call.
-Okay.

629
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,618
It's Seiji. Can I answer?

630
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,420
Hello.

631
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,923
Good morning, this is Seiji.

632
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,791
Good morning, this is Iwahashi.

633
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,725
Thank you.

634
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,927
I look forward to filming today.

635
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,728
Yes, me too. You know...

636
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:23,896
Yes?

637
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,698
My guest star was Mr. Osamu,
our agency's veteran comedian.

638
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,532
Bonchi Osamu
Has similar characteristics to Iwahashi

639
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,466
Really?

640
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,168
You sound surprised.

641
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,636
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not.

642
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,672
No, it was Mr. Osamu.

643
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,307
Wait...

644
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,175
So you're with Mr. Osamu now?

645
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,212
No, he just left.

646
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,481
So...

647
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,584
We're expecting another guest star
to join us soon?

648
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,318
Yeah.

649
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,486
Yeah, it will be similar to what we did.

650
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,155
So it's going to be Mr. Osamu
for me as well?

651
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,823
Well, it was him for my segment.

652
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,593
I think you should prepare something
to talk about with Mr. Osamu.

653
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,762
This is not good. Mr. Osamu
has the same characteristics as me.

654
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,632
We'll have frictions
and never get any work done.

655
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,936
I see... Where are you now?

656
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,439
We just passed Gotemba.

657
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,140
You're nearly there.

658
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,442
You're nearby?

659
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,011
Yeah, I'll wait for you
at the first meeting point.

660
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,446
Okay, thank you very much.

661
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,180
Sure thing.

662
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:15,948
Oh, no. Mr. Osamu is there.

663
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,584
Has Mr. Osamu joined Seiji's team?

664
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,020
Mr. Osamu jumps like this.

665
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,922
He can only ride in an open-top car.

666
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,557
Really?

667
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,792
Mr. Osamu never lets cameras
into his house.

668
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:27,760
That's right.

669
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,062
His wife doesn't want cameras
in the house ever again.

670
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,531
It's because Osamu
gets too tired afterwards.

671
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,168
Iwahashi's car draws closer and closer

672
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:39,105
to the location
where the Dark Army awaits.

673
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,974
He's here.

674
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,175
He is here.

675
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,076
He's here?

676
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:46,612
He's slow.

677
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,947
-He's coming now.
-It's such a nice car.

678
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,015
What?

679
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,684
What's going on?

680
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,322
Sata, bring him over here.

681
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,792
He parked his car there. Come on over.

682
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,794
Oh, no. This doesn't look good.

683
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,830
What the hell are you doing?

684
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,766
-Come on over.
-Don't let him escape.

685
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:07,800
Come over here.

686
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,835
This is so scary. What's going on?

687
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,071
What is this?

688
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,540
What is this?

689
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,108
He knows that a special guest
is joining him, right?

690
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,310
What's going on?

691
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:18,678
He's coming.

692
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,679
What is this?

693
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,215
What's this? What's going on?

694
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:24,183
Here.

695
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,319
What's this? What's going on?

696
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:27,920
Here you go.

697
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,188
Oh, no. What?

698
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,057
-I want to open the back too.
-Stop.

699
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,958
Here.

700
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,793
Why do you want to open the back?

701
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,528
I don't get it. What is this?

702
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,395
Hurry up and get out.

703
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:37,863
Good morning.

704
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,831
Thanks for coming.

705
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,099
What are you doing?

706
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,667
-Come on, get out.
-Get out.

707
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:42,601
Stop the engine.

708
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,769
Get out.

709
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:44,704
Stop the engine.

710
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,138
I really don't get it.

711
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,442
-What's wrong with you?
-Why are you screaming?

712
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,010
We've been waiting for you.

713
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,713
What a great car you have.

714
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,114
What's going on?

715
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,582
How did you get this car?

716
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,751
I bought it.

717
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,252
I saved up.

718
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,120
How much was it?

719
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,054
1.3 million yen.

720
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,756
Wow!

721
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,124
I bought it two years ago.

722
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,426
These wheels have been modified?

723
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,394
They have.

724
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,396
No, these didn't come with the car.

725
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,798
That looks so cool. You've customized it.

726
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,166
I changed it to a special type.

727
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,668
What else?

728
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,069
What else did you change?

729
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,071
The over fender here...

730
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,639
Wow.

731
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,409
I changed the position
of the muffler as well.

732
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,744
You've changed that, too?

733
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,278
It looks more discreet?

734
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,913
That's right. Just the exhaust.

735
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,149
The muffler... What?

736
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:30,883
What's wrong?

737
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,886
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

738
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,589
Shut up.

739
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,457
I don't know what's going on!

740
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,392
Everyone, come over here.

741
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,194
I still don't know what's going on.

742
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,029
Okay.

743
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,831
I don't understand the situation!

744
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,333
It's a really good car.

745
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,834
This car is fantastic.

746
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,369
It's a great car.

747
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,304
-It's really stable.
-It'll work really well.

748
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,305
It's a four-wheel drive.

749
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,074
It would be suitable.

750
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,776
What are you talking about?

751
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,044
Lots of horsepower, too.

752
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,812
Tell me what you're talking about.

753
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,080
It's a really good find.

754
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,081
Yes.

755
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,549
Am I just talking to myself?

756
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:04,817
Agreed.

757
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,185
Wait a minute.

758
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:06,952
Okay.

759
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,054
Done.

760
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,088
What's done?

761
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,356
You've passed.

762
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:11,323
Congratulations.

763
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,592
Congrats. Well done.

764
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,560
For what?

765
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,496
What was just decided?

766
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,632
Decision made.

767
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,599
You've passed.

768
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:21,867
What did I pass?

769
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,203
-We had a close look at your car.
-Okay.

770
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,004
You've passed.

771
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,739
Well done. Congrats.

772
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:27,606
Congratulations.

773
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,175
What did I pass?

774
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,612
-You've qualified to be my foot soldier.
-Foot soldier?

775
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:34,647
She's here.

776
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,048
She's gotten changed.

777
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,016
Come join us.

778
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,617
It's Yamada. She was just next to me.

779
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,186
Hey, Iwahashi.

780
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:40,986
What?

781
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,755
What happened?

782
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,157
You were enjoying yourself
driving along with me.

783
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,193
She was our spy.

784
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:47,960
Yeah.

785
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,129
You're so gullible, being duped so easily.

786
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,131
Damn, we were getting along so well

787
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,433
that I thought you might suck me off
at the end of the day.

788
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,069
You're such a lowlife.

789
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,904
Stop joking around.

790
00:28:58,971 --> 00:28:59,805
Itchy.

791
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:00,973
You're the worst.

792
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,241
The worst.

793
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,577
What are you doing?

794
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:10,483
The uncontrollable hitman,
Yoshimasa Iwahashi

795
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,984
Honda Crossroad
New car price 2.9 million yen

796
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,653
Iwahashi is joining the battle
with his own car, the Honda Crossroad.

797
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,588
Its main characteristics

798
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,723
are high vehicle height
and the rectangular body.

799
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,526
This car has been customized

800
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,528
with a larger set of tires,
and an over fender.

801
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,296
It's Iwahashi's original model.

802
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:28,100
I don't understand
what Hamada's army means.

803
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:28,934
I know.

804
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,369
What does it mean?

805
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,105
It doesn't make any sense.

806
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,642
I was told I needed to buy a car
to shoot this series.

807
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,513
Since I saw Mr. Hamada there,

808
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,617
I realized it wasn't part of the show
I was shooting this morning.

809
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,653
I don't know.

810
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,555
I don't know...

811
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,190
I could crash into all of them.

812
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:59,965
Hamada's army
will soon arrive at this battlefield,

813
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,400
where Junior's army awaits.

814
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,007
Attack!

815
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:12,444
Here they are.
The lowlife barbarians from Osaka.

816
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,315
Look at those clunky-looking cars.

817
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,183
Yeah.

818
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,353
Here they are entering the battlefield,

819
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,956
led by the pervert barbarian from Osaka
who uses any means to win.

820
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,658
Hamada's army.

821
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,827
How could they show their faces?

822
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,230
Looks like a suburban car park.

823
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,199
Well said.

824
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,503
As opposed to Junior's army
that's full of foreign luxury cars,

825
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,606
Hamada will battle
with a fleet of Japanese cars.

826
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,841
Here's some breaking news.

827
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,844
Hamada has assembled his fleet
using somewhat dubious tactics.

828
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,046
Strategy that's barely legal.

829
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,647
There's a bamboo spear
taped to the muffler.

830
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,783
They are raring to go. And what's this?

831
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,585
That looks like someone's company car.

832
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,787
-Like, a regular car?
-A company car.

833
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,955
It's a company car.

834
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,390
Looks like a real estate agent's car.

835
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,859
Come on,
we don't use bamboo spears anymore.

836
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:04,463
The Honda Crossroad
and Nissan Fuga at the rear.

837
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,367
Yes, these are battle cars
forcibly made to join Hamada's army.

838
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,603
With this fleet of eight cars,

839
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,138
Hamada will attempt
to bring down Junior's castle.

840
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,942
Yeah. Are the battle cars ready?

841
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,911
Yes, they're as ready as they can be.

842
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:21,747
We're ready.

843
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,382
I still don't get it...

844
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,818
Could someone please explain to me
what is going on?

845
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:27,586
Yeah, all of it.

846
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,255
I really don't understand.

847
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,823
-Hey, Sata.
-Yes.

848
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,358
You brought along you own car too?

849
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,659
Yes, of course.

850
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,327
Here it is.

851
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:36,495
This is it.

852
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,163
It's a vintage vehicle.

853
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,098
Wow.

854
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,299
Well, well.

855
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:41,967
This car is 41 years old.

856
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,570
It was released in 1976.

857
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,306
I'd say there's only about
30 of these cars left in Japan.

858
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:48,941
Wow!

859
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:51,810
If I take it to a dealer,
they'll offer me seven million yen.

860
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,945
What?

861
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,214
-Seriously?
-That's what kind of car this is.

862
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,982
But I brought this car today,

863
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,184
under strict orders from our agency.

864
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,387
"Mr. Hamada wants your car," they said.

865
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:02,821
That's right.

866
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:08,761
The man who nearly united Kyushu,
Masaki Sata

867
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:09,928
Nissan Laurel 2000SGX
New car price 1.03 million yen

868
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,930
Engine 2L I6 SOHC / 130 hp / FR / 5MT / Weight 1200kg

869
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,966
Sata has courageously entered this battle
with his car, the Nissan Laurel.

870
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,635
This is a second-generation
Nissan Laurel C130 model,

871
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,038
first brought to the market in 1972.

872
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,408
Due to its two-door hardtop shape,

873
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,143
it's been nicknamed "pig's butt."

874
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,380
It's an extremely rare car that is
very popular with vintage car enthusiasts.

875
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:29,715
And this?

876
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:30,482
It's mine.

877
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,651
-The Z model is my car.
-Okay.

878
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:38,657
The man who wears shorts all year round,
Kunikazu Katsumata

879
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,958
His battle car is the Nissan Fairlady Z.

880
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,961
New car price 3.5 million yen
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1440kg

881
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,331
It's Japan's true sports car.

882
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,902
Although it weighs only 1,500 kilograms,
it carries a 3.5-liter engine

883
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,604
and can output 280 horsepower.

884
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,274
-Whose is this?
-This is mine.

885
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,742
Wow.

886
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,815
The Chihara family's mad dog,
Seiji Chihara

887
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:03,982
His battle car is a Toyota Celsior.

888
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,452
New car price 8 million yen
Engine 4.3L V8 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1800kg

889
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,188
This is Toyota's executive-class car

890
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,023
which evolved into the Lexus brand.

891
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,992
This model continues to be popular

892
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,028
among hard-faced men like Seiji.

893
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:17,663
Who does this belong to?

894
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,664
This doesn't look good.

895
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,767
No way...

896
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,369
What's wrong with you?

897
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,804
I've driven a lot of cars,

898
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,272
but nothing like this.

899
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,808
I've never seen anything like this.

900
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:30,743
What are you talking about?

901
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,144
The only thing that matters
is the horsepower, not what it looks like.

902
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:33,178
If you say so...

903
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:39,184
The best driver in a thousand years
(according to himself), Juichi Wakisaka

904
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:44,857
The car assigned to a driver
who has only driven a Toyota for 16 years

905
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,226
is from a rival manufacturer,
a Nissan Skyline.

906
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,862
Modified to suit flashy drivers
from Chiba and Ibaraki,

907
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,232
it features a giant over fender,
and a muffler made out of bamboo spears.

908
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,933
It is destined to be very fast.

909
00:33:55,033 --> 00:34:00,072
New car price 3.1 million yen
Engine 2.5L I6 DOHC / 200 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1400kg

910
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,206
So this car...

911
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,341
Awesome!

912
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:03,609
It's a perfect fit for you.

913
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,610
It really is.

914
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,111
This looks really strong.

915
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,012
Indeed.

916
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:08,447
We need you to perform well.

917
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,381
Yes, that's true.

918
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,383
We need you to be healthy
till the very end.

919
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,152
You don't need to worry about me.

920
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:20,192
The man with a face that could kill,
Hitoshi Ozawa

921
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,493
His battle car is a Toyota Century.

922
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,396
New car price 12 million yen
Engine 5L V12 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 2000kg

923
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,999
This car was manufactured to celebrate
the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda,

924
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,567
the founder of Toyota Industries.

925
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,837
It's a limited-edition car
that Japan can be proud of.

926
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,174
This is the only car that distinguishes
those who drive it as VIPs.

927
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,777
It is often used by Japanese government
officials and high-class executives.

928
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:39,978
Excuse me, Mr. Hamada.

929
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,046
What's up?

930
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:43,382
Having seen the cars up until now...

931
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,416
Hey, you're...

932
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,918
Are you allowed to be on-screen?

933
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,486
It's Mr. Mosaic.

934
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,554
Yes...

935
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,190
Apparently, it's okay on Amazon Prime.

936
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,359
Thank you very much, Amazon Prime.

937
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,694
-That's great.
-I still...

938
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,296
Is it a little early?

939
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,964
It's still early for regular TV.

940
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,265
Thank you to Amazon.

941
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:01,900
Wait just a second.

942
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:02,734
What is this?

943
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:06,305
Have a look at this entry and compare it
to the other cars in the team.

944
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,173
It kind of looks like a delivery car.

945
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,976
I see this type of car
around the Kabukicho area in Tokyo.

946
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,110
Delivery cars, right?

947
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,947
Cars delivering things to various shops.

948
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,148
It does look like a delivery car.

949
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,983
That's right, it's a delivery car.

950
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:19,451
Nonetheless...

951
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,488
I'm trying to make a mark here today.

952
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,422
Fair enough.

953
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:29,428
Resurrected after ten years of silence,
the Golden Boy, Keiichi Yamamoto

954
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:30,496
His battle car is the Toyota Corolla Van.

955
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:33,365
New car price 1.5 million yen
Engine 1.3L I4 DOHC / 82 hp / FF / 4MT / Weight 930kg

956
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,700
In the van bonnet class,

957
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,870
it has been
the number-one selling car for 26 years.

958
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,672
With a maximum weight capacity
of 400 kilograms,

959
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,742
it can carry 33 mandarin orange boxes.

960
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,511
This is the king of delivery cars.

961
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,080
-Here we go.
-Yes.

962
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,715
-Wait a minute.
-What's up?

963
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,550
I really love this car.

964
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,019
Can we take this off?

965
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,320
HAMADA 0511
HAMADA'S ARMY

966
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,955
Why do you want to take it off?

967
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,157
-You should be proud to have it on.
-It's a battle car now.

968
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,093
It's got "Hamada" written
on a black plate.

969
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,694
No, it's too dangerous. I can't have it.

970
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,662
It's a battle car.

971
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:04,997
It's the same for Nagisa.

972
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,064
I just can't...

973
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,400
You keep saying "battle car."

974
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,701
This is a guess, but...

975
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,403
It's not going to come back
in one piece, right?

976
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,639
-Right?
-It depends on how you decide to fight.

977
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,240
That's right.

978
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:16,408
It depends on how well you play.

979
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,043
I can only think of a terrible ending.

980
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,646
This is so much better than that boring,
fake TV show, right?

981
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,147
Which do you prefer?

982
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,116
This one?

983
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,087
It's all good then. It's all good.

984
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:33,058
Sentosha Battle Royale.

985
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,228
The battle is about to begin.

986
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,731
Take a look at that.

987
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,266
Who's that ugly woman?

988
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,301
Who?

989
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:44,436
Wow.

990
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,772
She's beyond ugly.

991
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,674
Hey.

992
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,609
What's with the ugly woman?

993
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,078
What?

994
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:56,848
I can tell that she's ugly
even from this distance.

995
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,484
I must admit
I'm a bit uncomfortable as well.

996
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,421
My team is just a bunch of weirdos.

997
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,724
There's also someone
who can't be on-screen.

998
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,060
Yeah.

999
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,729
It's okay to be on Amazon.

1000
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,365
You can only see him on Amazon.

1001
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,234
I can only appear on Amazon.

1002
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:18,203
All right then.

1003
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,771
Thank you, Amazon.

1004
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,507
It's probably not the best time for this,
but it's very nice to meet you.

1005
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,210
-What? First time?
-Is it the first time you met?

1006
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,979
-Pretty much the first time.
-Really, the first time?

1007
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:27,713
Seriously?

1008
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,448
Yes, it really is the first time.

1009
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,882
Pretty much the first time.

1010
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,018
However, a very long time ago,

1011
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,387
when we were doing
a comedy show in Nagoya,

1012
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,422
we did catch a glimpse
of the Chihara Brothers

1013
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,591
having a backstage fight.

1014
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:40,993
But that's all.

1015
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,364
They were having a fist fight
with another comedy duo.

1016
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,665
Me and my partner tried to break it up.

1017
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,699
You didn't actually do it.

1018
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,667
Who were they fighting?

1019
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,335
The Battle Begins

1020
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:51,970
Look at this.

1021
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,839
He's got a grenade in his hand.

1022
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:56,308
One battle car pushes another one
right around.

1023
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,543
Now we're coming along
to the slippery zone.

1024
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,645
He can't stop.

1025
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:01,947
Is he okay?

1026
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:02,948
He's on his roof.

1027
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:07,586
SENTOSHA
