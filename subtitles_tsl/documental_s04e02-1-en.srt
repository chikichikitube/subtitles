PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,961
What kind of comedian
is suited to Documental?

4
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,064
Well, you know...

5
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:34,869
For example, in gymnastics there's a move
named after the gymnast Shirai.

6
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:39,106
When you perform an amazing new technique,
they name it after you, right?

7
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,242
If we did the same for Documental,

8
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:45,146
we could name a new technique for people
who are amazingly bad.

9
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,716
It would be "Uchima."
That's how unsuited he was to the show.

10
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:52,987
No way!

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,221
Why?

12
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,557
No way.
I won't do any good with Nobu here.

13
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,560
But when you really think about it,
Uchima was funny.

14
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,629
Don't get me wrong.

15
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,932
It's not like I'm bad-mouthing Uchima.

16
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,803
Thinking about it now, you can see
a funny side to what Uchima did.

17
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,573
That's one example that shows
how there are many layers to comedy.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,742
Comedy really is a deep concept.

19
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,913
It can't be!

20
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,614
What a surprise!

21
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,349
It can't be! You accepted?

22
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:28,449
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO
Presents Documental

23
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,318
It will stick to your mustache.

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,522
No, it won't stick to my mustache.

25
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,656
Drink some.

26
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,191
Bottoms up.

27
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,427
He drank it in one gulp.

28
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,463
It stuck.

29
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,566
-It was your own setup.
-Exactly.

30
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,234
We can laugh now, right?

31
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,536
-Daigo.
-Is it a red?

32
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,771
-Yellow.
-Yes, I know.

33
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,006
What's wrong, Kurosawa?

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,909
-She's crying.
-What's wrong?

35
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,677
She's crying?

36
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,813
-What is it?
-We can't let people like that in here.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,015
What is it?

38
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,750
It's a man's world.

39
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,686
-"It's a man's world."
-It's a man's world?

40
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:06,787
It's okay, Kurosawa.

41
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,456
Don't worry about it.
You're not the first.

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,669
-We're on.
-Was that the start?

43
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,003
-It's started.
-Yeah.

44
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,572
He was so kind to her.

45
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,907
Now you mention it, yeah. That was weird.

46
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,276
-They've done it.
-You could've left her alone.

47
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,444
We haven't "done it."

48
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,480
-You were kind to her.
-Of course I was.

49
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,316
Have you done it?

50
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,352
No. Stop insinuating I was kind
because we've done it.

51
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,721
-What does "done it" mean?
-You two had sex?

52
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,524
He's saying we've done it,
but of course we haven't.

53
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,425
Right, Kurosawa?

54
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:45,960
We did it.

55
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,362
-You did?
-Really?

56
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:50,831
With Fujimoto?

57
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,099
-You did?
-Yes.

58
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,834
-Fujimoto?
-Kurosawa...

59
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,269
You did it?

60
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,438
-No, we didn't. Why lie?
-Keep going.

61
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,239
She's a bit unstable now. Sorry.

62
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,574
Who'd you do it with?

63
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,709
Fujimoto.

64
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,044
You did it?

65
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,045
Yes.

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,182
-That's wrong, Fujimoto.
-Why him?

67
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,284
You can't touch comedians your junior.

68
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,819
You fuck family.

69
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,654
When?

70
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,556
In 1998.

71
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,291
That's quite a way back.

72
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,260
-Right after your debut?
-Yes.

73
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,097
We've never done it. Why lie?
Have you gone mad?

74
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,298
Where did it happen?

75
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,699
-Drink some tea.
-Where?

76
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,902
-In Tameike-sanno. In the basement.
-Minato City?

77
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,105
In the basement of
the agency's old office.

78
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,474
-Before Fujimoto got married?
-In the basement.

79
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,442
-We rehearsed there.
-The old office?

80
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,977
Yoshimoto's old headquarters.

81
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,513
-Before it moved to Jimbocho.
-After rehearsals?

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,414
Yes.

83
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,216
An important issue here is,

84
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,053
was it because you liked him,
or did he use his position as your senior?

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,622
We didn't do it. Why do you assume we did?

86
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,957
In what position?

87
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,692
What do you call it?

88
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,496
It's the one where there's a head here,
and up here is...

89
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,264
In your face, you have genitals.

90
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,699
What?

91
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,467
The one known as a number?

92
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,736
A number? One even, one odd?

93
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,506
-A number?
-I don't get it.

94
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,408
Show us how you did it.

95
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:08,676
Try it.

96
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,978
I have to do a sixty-nine with her now?

97
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,647
-We just want to verify.
-Because we don't get it.

98
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:17,618
-We don't get what happened.
-So, we just want you to reenact it.

99
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,520
Who was on top?

100
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,522
Kurosawa, who was on top?

101
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,157
We were sideways.

102
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,324
Sideways?

103
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,993
-That's new.
-Sideways...

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,395
-"The forty-nine position."
-Is that a thing?

105
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,597
-That was your final position?
-Yes.

106
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,466
-You were like that?
-Yes.

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,902
-I don't get it.
-You go from behind...

108
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,804
Right?

109
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,605
-Where was Fujimoto's face?
-Here.

110
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,240
It was there? What do you mean?

111
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,642
There's no final blow...

112
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,811
-It's not a sixty-nine.
-Try moving...

113
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,846
-It's not sixty-nine!
-Lay down.

114
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:46,980
It's a new number.

115
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,383
What is it? It's not a sixty-nine...

116
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,451
Right here.

117
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,520
Your hands were...
You didn't really touch me.

118
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,556
-He didn't touch you?
-Not at all.

119
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,690
Oral only?

120
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,592
-This bit...
-His nasal bridge?

121
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,593
...went inside.

122
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:00,961
It went inside?

123
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,530
-Is that what Fujimoto wanted to do?
-Yes.

124
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,666
That's not really mating.

125
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,434
-The tip of his nose?
-Yes.

126
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,103
-It went inside?
-It slid in?

127
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,206
-The tip of his nose?
-That's not it. You were a bit closer.

128
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,475
-A bit closer?
-Even closer?

129
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,277
-Oh, yeahhh.
-It's inside.

130
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,979
-"Oh, yeahhh"?
-It's inside?

131
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,013
Oh, yeahhh.

132
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,082
Why are you talking like Henna Ojisan?

133
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,951
-Oh, yeahhh.
-"Oh, yeahhh"?

134
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,853
Hey. She's talking like Shimura.

135
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,988
Why do you talk like Henna Ojisan?

136
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,225
-Do you talk like Shimura during sex?
-Oh, yeahhh.

137
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:35,129
-Whenever Kurosawa is ready.
-Okay, I'll try it.

138
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,897
Ready? Here goes.

139
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,232
Oh, yeahhh.

140
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,933
Once more.

141
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,903
-And again.
-Okay.

142
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,838
-You don't say it every time?
-No.

143
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,508
-Why not?
-Maybe you're missing the spot.

144
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,243
-Try again.
-The spot?

145
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,178
-Ready?
-If it's right, she'll say so.

146
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,213
That's not it. That's too strong.

147
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,249
-That's too strong.
-It is?

148
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,718
You didn't come with so much force.

149
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,853
-He was more gentle?
-Slide it in.

150
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,555
-Be more gentle.
-Slide it in.

151
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,690
Oh, are you wearing greasepaint?

152
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,761
-Yeah, I am.
-It will rub off on her pants.

153
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,063
Of course she's worried about stains.

154
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,432
-Fujimoto, that's not good.
-Not good at all.

155
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,568
You can't leave makeup on a lady's pants.

156
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,437
-The conclusion is that you never had sex?
-Right.

157
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,506
-I'm not sure...
-We didn't do it.

158
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,675
-So the result is...
-It was just a nose.

159
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,077
-Just a nose.
-Noses don't really count.

160
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,880
-Could you stop checking in front of us?
-Sorry.

161
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,383
-Your underwear is showing.
-But they're layered.

162
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,819
That's not good. You're a lady.
That's not good!

163
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,786
What is that?

164
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,122
-What are you wearing?
-Two pairs.

165
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,958
I'm wearing one pair of regular pants,
and some boxers.

166
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,327
-They're the same color as concrete.
-Yes.

167
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,895
Like granite.

168
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,230
Yes. They're gray.

169
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,465
They mine a lot of granite in Kitagishima.

170
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,568
-That's irrelevant.
-It's my hometown.

171
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,469
-It's irrelevant.
-"The Rock Island."

172
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,637
We don't need to know.

173
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,674
-Your father collects round rocks, right?
-Exactly.

174
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,342
My dad...

175
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,446
He used to go to the beach,
and on the dunes,

176
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:03,116
he would search for the roundest rocks
that he could find.

177
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,119
Then he would show them
to the chief of the island.

178
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,356
-"The chief of the island?" Huh?
-The chief of the island.

179
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,791
The island has a chief?

180
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,926
My dad always said, "The Chief."

181
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,596
-It wasn't his boss at work, right?
-Huh?

182
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,064
Like the don of the island.

183
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,233
-Someone influential?
-Someone influential.

184
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,769
My dad would find a round rock and say,
"I found a really round one."

185
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,905
Then he showed the chief.

186
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,176
Stop saying "Chief."
Call them something else.

187
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,411
-Does he get paid?
-A little.

188
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,080
-How much?
-Five thousand yen.

189
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,318
That's how he raised you?

190
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,855
-With round rocks?
-Five thousand yen per rock?

191
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,158
-He only gets paid if they're very round.
-Really round.

192
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,794
-The rounder, the more expensive?
-That makes sense.

193
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,465
-What's he talking about?
-The rounder ones are worth more.

194
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,634
So the chief is a collector
of round rocks?

195
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,869
The chief runs a stone company.

196
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,807
You should've said so from the start.
We were wondering why they'd buy rocks.

197
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,976
The rocks are used for something, right?

198
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,646
-I think the chief just looks at them.
-Just looks?

199
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,248
The chief lady collects rocks
just to look at them?

200
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,816
The chief isn't a woman.

201
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,819
Really? I assumed it was a lady chief.
Sorry.

202
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,122
-Nine out of ten chiefs are men.
-I see.

203
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,357
That's a little sexist.

204
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,294
It's not sexist. A female chief?

205
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,463
You see them sometimes.
There are female chiefs.

206
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,998
Like Wonder Woman.

207
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,434
Wonder Woman has nothing to do with this.

208
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,972
Well, that was a great souvenir.

209
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,374
-It's funny.
-Who's the souvenir for?

210
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,575
The City of Shinagawa.

211
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,613
It's where I live. A souvenir.

212
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,948
You don't buy souvenirs?

213
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,416
I do buy souvenirs.

214
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,951
Are you good at souvenirs?

215
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,752
When you're out on location.

216
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,821
What does "good at souvenirs" mean?

217
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,657
-Do you have good taste in souvenirs?
-Well, you know...

218
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,393
I often buy local delicacies,
but I let them go bad.

219
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:58,165
-They go past the expiration date?
-Yeah, when you go to the countryside.

220
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,535
-But I like them.
-I see edible chili oil everywhere I go.

221
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,004
I've let a few go to waste.

222
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,340
Edible chili oil.

223
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,843
The thing is, because it's spicy,
you assume that it lasts forever.

224
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,345
-Yeah.
-You're right.

225
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,347
-They have "edible chili oil"?
-Yeah.

226
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,915
-It was all the rage.
-Really?

227
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,551
-Some time ago.
-Pengin Shokudo started it off.

228
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,053
Pengin Shokudo? Who "ur" that?

229
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,855
Pengin Shokudo.

230
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,991
Remember "throwable dumplings"?

231
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,895
What was that?

232
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,564
What are you doing?

233
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,065
That was pathetic!

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,669
How loud was that laugh?
He let out such a loud voice!

235
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,405
-You must be joking.
-No, I kept it in.

236
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,140
I resisted the urge.

237
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,176
-Seriously, you screwed me.
-I didn't screw you at all.

238
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:47,381
-It wasn't fair to stare right at me.
-You were simply the closest.

239
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,616
-What happened?
-What was so funny?

240
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,620
We talked about "edible chili oil"
then he made up "throwable dumplings."

241
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,190
-We heard, but...
-What is that?

242
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,260
I totally imagined him
throwing dumplings like this.

243
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:04,264
-Who wouldn't imagine that?
-The image popped into your head, right?

244
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,699
It's understandable.

245
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,601
But that really was awful.

246
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,536
You went, "Ge he he he!"

247
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,104
That was pathetic!

248
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,672
Damn. I'm so weak!

249
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,642
-They have "edible chili oil"?
-Yeah.

250
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,210
-It was all the rage.
-Really?

251
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,846
-Some time ago.
-Pengin Shokudo started it off.

252
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,382
Pengin Shokudo? Who "ur" that?

253
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,418
He tried to make a move first.

254
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,520
Remember "throwable dumplings"?

255
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,994
He couldn't light the cigarette
quickly enough.

256
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,229
But it wasn't a hearty laugh.

257
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,597
Well...

258
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah, but I have no choice.

259
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,101
Sorry.

260
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,603
-Thanks for being lenient.
-That was quick.

261
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,839
-It was quick.
-Yeah, it's still early on.

262
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,809
-It's only been half an hour?
-Five and a half to go.

263
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,010
For real?

264
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,479
I don't think I'll...
Can you guys do this?

265
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,881
If he becomes a zombie,
he'll keep coming out.

266
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,317
Turning him into a zombie
is frightening too.

267
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,254
-More opportunities to attack is scary.
-Don't leave before us.

268
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,457
We don't want him a zombie too early.

269
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,459
And she didn't know any sex positions.

270
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,098
Here we go.

271
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,837
It's no use playing your cards slowly.
If you lose, it's over.

272
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,207
Do you know those squeaky birds
that go "wah"? Let's play with one.

273
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,608
You have one?

274
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,877
-That sounds good.
-What's he up to?

275
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,513
We should play more.
Take our mind off things.

276
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,249
-A squeaky bird?
-They go "Wah" when you squeeze them.

277
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,985
-Those things that look like a turkey?
-That's right.

278
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,654
Kurochan just put away a milk bottle
so slowly.

279
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,090
You don't need to say that.

280
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,792
I don't remember.

281
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,730
-I've seen those before.
-The U.S. Marine Corps use these.

282
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,166
For enlistment tests
or something, apparently.

283
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,169
-What kind of test?
-They tell you not to laugh.

284
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,071
Then they play it next to your ear.

285
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,373
-And you can't laugh.
-It's not funny.

286
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,208
-Nobody would laugh.
-It's just...

287
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,343
Maybe they go...

288
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,182
What the hell?

289
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,317
They do something like that.

290
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,385
Apparently.

291
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,087
Fujimoto, try calling me.

292
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,122
Hang on. Everyone, gather around.

293
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,192
-It's not fair to stay over there.
-We should watch together.

294
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,327
Call me, and try not to laugh.

295
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,631
-It won't be hard.
-Yeah.

296
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,965
We've already seen it.

297
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,035
-I'm ready.
-Here goes.

298
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,137
-Miyasako!
-What?

299
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,807
-Squeeze it.
-It didn't squeak.

300
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,876
-That's wrong.
-What's your point?

301
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,615
-Well...
-That was...

302
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:36,883
Someone else try it.

303
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,818
How about Nishizawa?

304
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,554
Nishizawa...

305
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,491
-Try it, Nishizawa. Come to the front.
-Nishizawa has a great face.

306
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,493
I'm not Nishizawa!

307
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,362
-I've never tried this.
-Be careful of him.

308
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,098
-When his mind starts spinning...
-Exactly.

309
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,267
-Look properly.
-I will.

310
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,803
-Damn you. Damn you!
-They do look alike.

311
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,006
Should we call you?

312
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,911
Maybe I should kill you.

313
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,647
-Can you call me?
-You should've waited until we did.

314
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,849
-Sorry.
-Don't just suddenly turn around.

315
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,750
Sorry.

316
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,752
No, no.

317
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,959
Nishizawa, were you listening?
Wait until we call you.

318
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,093
Okay.

319
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,397
I brought more, actually.

320
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,465
No, no, no.

321
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,601
-What?
-I have more.

322
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,369
-More?
-I brought several.

323
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,204
-More of those toys?
-Yeah. Hang on.

324
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,572
He bought a lot.

325
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,774
-He has several?
-And you should...

326
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,878
Who's that on your T-shirt?

327
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,781
This prop could come in handy later.

328
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,217
-They're all a different length.
-Wow. So many!

329
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,553
-You brought a whole lot.
-Are they the same?

330
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,922
-What if you squeeze them all at once?
-Really?

331
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,294
-It's the whole family.
-Wow.

332
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,795
-Amazing.
-That was nice.

333
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,564
Daigo laughed, right?

334
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,934
-Who was that?
-Really?

335
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,335
Who was it?

336
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,470
Was it you?

337
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,338
-Daigo?
-If it's Daigo, he's out.

338
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,774
-No way. I didn't actually laugh.
-Yes, you did.

339
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,842
I didn't laugh.

340
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,278
-You already have a yellow card, right?
-Really?

341
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,280
-He has one yellow card.
-Daigo...

342
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,115
Wait. Was I laughing?

343
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,750
I didn't laugh. I didn't.

344
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,585
-He's here.
-Who was it?

345
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,086
So soon?

346
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,789
-It's too quick.
-It's still so early on.

347
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,125
Daigo.

348
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,227
Let's take a look.

349
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:32,732
I'll have another look.
I'm not quite sure yet myself.

350
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,101
It would be so sad to lose Daigo.

351
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,075
-It's the whole family.
-Wow.

352
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,479
-Just for that?
-No way. It was a complete laugh!

353
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,481
I have to give you an orange card.

354
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,950
-It's really worth more.
-I know.

355
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,986
But if I gave you this,

356
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,354
it would mean this.

357
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,389
-That's what it would mean.
-Right?

358
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,258
-Let's continue!
-Okay!

359
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,226
Stop it. Moments like that linger.

360
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,763
Let me calm down for a minute.
Please don't spring that on me yet.

361
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,632
What is wrong with him?

362
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,368
Daigo is so weak!

363
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:13,239
He's so weak, right? Pathetic.

364
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,279
Here we go.

365
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,716
And we're on.

366
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,617
-Let's calm down a little.
-Yeah.

367
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,386
The tempo's too quick.

368
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,255
-Is this quicker than usual?
-It's very quick.

369
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,258
One more slip-up
and Daigo's definitely out, right?

370
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,296
-The next time I'm called...
-Even a little smile will finish you.

371
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,565
-That's scary.
-Let me do it once.

372
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,233
-Stop it already.
-Hear that?

373
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,335
Each has a different sound.

374
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,071
Enough with that!

375
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,172
Sir?

376
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,608
Are you the hero who saved their lives?

377
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,879
You're holding them so dearly.

378
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,781
Look at those arms.

379
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,251
-When you squeeze them...
-Your jacket's too tight.

380
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,387
They flex.

381
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,422
He looks like a kangaroo.

382
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,923
Around his arms.

383
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,727
I knew that would happen.

384
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,630
-It's like an Aflac commercial.
-Hey, you're cosplaying.

385
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,731
-What?
-Huh?

386
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:12,932
That's not cosplay?

387
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,735
-Did you change your outfit?
-No, I didn't.

388
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,972
-What cosplay is it?
-A Kariyushi Urban Resort staff member.

389
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,607
The hotel.

390
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,610
You know Kariyushi Urban Resort
in Okinawa?

391
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,446
-You're doing that cosplay, right?
-No.

392
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,347
Really?

393
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,682
-Hotel staff?
-Yeah. I've stayed there.

394
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:30,984
It's a good hotel.

395
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,355
-Hey, what's that?
-Whoa.

396
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,292
You scared me.
I thought it was the buzzer.

397
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,862
-Does this shirt really look like that?
-It does. Look it up.

398
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:43,963
It's identical.

399
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,598
This is "faaast."

400
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,300
-Not "sweeet."
-You're right.

401
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,602
-Right?
-It's a bullet train.

402
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,938
-Nishizawa's dance...
-What are bullet trains?

403
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,807
Faaast!

404
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,375
-Shut up.
-You scared me.

405
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,543
Who'd laugh at that?

406
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,077
Yeah, bullet trains are fast.

407
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,982
Fujimoto, Fujimoto. Fujimoto.

408
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,387
Kurochan, can you dance for us?

409
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,806
-That wasn't funny at all.
-Seriously.

410
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,509
-Is that possible?
-To be completely unfunny?

411
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,978
Didn't you have anything?

412
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,813
-Any what?
-Anything to slip in.

413
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,748
Something of your own.

414
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,283
-My own thing?
-I mean,

415
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,252
did you really try to make us laugh?

416
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,587
Wasn't it halfhearted?

417
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,423
You asked me to dance,
so I just tried to dance...

418
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,758
"Just trying to dance"
won't make us laugh.

419
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,028
Next station is Shin-Osaka.

420
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,797
Wow. It speaks!

421
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,172
-It's been speaking the whole time.
-It's a talking toy.

422
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,008
Until a while ago... Oh, it's speaking!

423
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,345
Didn't you have such a toy as a kid?

424
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,679
No, I didn't.

425
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,681
What did you play with, then?

426
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,517
Video games.

427
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,684
What the hell?

428
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,720
What else?

429
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,154
"What else?"

430
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:17,957
"What else"?

431
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,759
Only video games?

432
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,161
-No, no.
-Then tell us.

433
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,264
Okay. Um... Flints.

434
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,267
Flints?

435
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,469
-Your parents bought some?
-Yes.

436
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,972
-Is that a plaything?
-It's not a toy.

437
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,009
Next station is Shin-Osaka.

438
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,977
It spoke again!

439
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,113
-Of course it does.
-That's what it does.

440
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,482
-You had toys like this?
-Yeah.

441
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,884
Whose voice is it?

442
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,520
-Someone famous?
-Who do you think it is?

443
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,489
-"Someone famous"!
-Akiko Wada.

444
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,326
-"Someone famous"!
-Maybe it's because she speaks fast.

445
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,762
"Someone famous"!

446
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,934
-I don't get it.
-Are you really Kurochan?

447
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,670
I am the real Kurochan.

448
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,539
-White-chan?
-Wrong color. "Kuro" is "black."

449
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,207
You're quick.

450
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,476
My hair's thick?

451
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:11,978
"You're quick."

452
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,647
-Are you Blue-chan?
-I'm not that soothing.

453
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,516
Red-chan?

454
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,452
-To my parents I'm a red-faced baby.
-You screwed it.

455
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:22,188
The only thing I screw is
my face when I'm vexed.

456
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,090
You screw lids, too.

457
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:25,992
Nope.

458
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,595
-Yellow-chan?
-No, I don't make you look bloated.

459
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,563
-Wow.
-So you are Red-chan?

460
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,467
-To my parents, I'm a red-faced baby.
-You already said that...

461
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,103
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't do this to your own partner.

462
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,106
How close can you get?

463
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,275
-They're a friendly duo.
-They are.

464
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,876
There's nothing wrong with it.

465
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,280
We look like we're young actors
doing a photoshoot.

466
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,649
-Young actors?
-They take photos like this?

467
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,117
Young actors pose like,

468
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,186
"What's going on, dude?"

469
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,455
During a shoot?

470
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,690
Something like that!

471
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,225
Fujimoto did that?

472
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,593
Why would I?

473
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:02,795
Did I?

474
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,263
Who was it?

475
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,432
-What's wrong?
-Ouch.

476
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,934
Wait a minute!

477
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,435
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

478
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,903
What was that, Nobu?

479
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,373
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

480
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,141
-No, no, no.
-All by yourself.

481
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,010
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

482
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,579
What? I didn't do anything wrong!

483
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,280
It's not my fault.

484
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,449
Why did everyone stare at me at once?

485
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,518
-Of course we'd look.
-That was natural.

486
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,987
You were feeding the setup.
You were reacting.

487
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,089
That was wrong. That was...

488
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,693
-Mr. Matsumoto, I didn't laugh.
-Your feeding wasn't that good either.

489
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,563
It seems that both of Chidori are weak.

490
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,532
I laugh a bit too easily.

491
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,168
-Chidori are weak.
-Nothing was even happening.

492
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,937
Nothing.
Not even the viewers were laughing.

493
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,541
-You were the only one.
-Yeah. What was that?

494
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,710
You're the only one in Japan who laughed.

495
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,546
That's awful. That's an awful way to lose.

496
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,684
We look like we're young actors
doing a photoshoot.

497
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,086
-Young actors?
-They take photos like this?

498
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,521
Young actors pose like,

499
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,656
"What's going on, dude?"

500
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,925
During a shoot?

501
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,127
Something like that!

502
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:10,263
Fujimoto did that?

503
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,999
-Why would I?
-He's already done for.

504
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,100
Did I?

505
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,170
What was so funny?

506
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,671
I can't do that?

507
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,041
What was so funny about that?

508
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,510
How did he manage not to laugh until now?

509
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,513
-If he laughs at just that...
-With a defense so weak...

510
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,849
That's not it. This is bad.

511
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,485
Anyway, you've got a yellow.

512
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,387
This helped me steel myself.

513
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,889
Everyone says that. You all do.

514
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,858
You say it, but no one is hardened.

515
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,061
There's a chance Chidori will be
the first and second to go.

516
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,097
I don't want that. I really don't.

517
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,766
I think we should try
not moving around so much.

518
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,802
-That's not our problem.
-No, it's not.

519
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,804
-That's your strategy?
-It's up to you.

520
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,539
-Go for it.
-It's not our problem.

521
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,942
The guy who laughs quickest
is giving advice?

522
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,477
It's not our problem.

523
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,779
That sure was a crappy strategy.

524
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,515
This may end quickly.
It hasn't even been an hour yet.

525
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,784
-This isn't good.
-Do your best.

526
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,586
-We will.
-Thank you.

527
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,656
Setting up a joke can make you laugh.

528
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,658
-It happens.
-You laugh at it yourself.

529
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,228
I have to rethink this.

530
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,432
One million yen is at stake.
Mr. Matsumoto's watching. Time to rethink.

531
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,601
You need to calm down.

532
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:23,903
Let's go.

533
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,107
Okay.

534
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,476
-She's squeezing cucumber slices.
-What?

535
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,112
-Wow. So feminine.
-What are you making?

536
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,413
Well...

537
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,149
This is cucumber...

538
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,919
-Has it started?
-Yes, it has.

539
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,187
Seriously?

540
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,156
-Tastes good.
-Nicely pickled.

541
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,257
What's that?

542
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,626
Pickled cucumber.

543
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,494
That's enough.

544
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,396
Have some more.

545
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,932
I nearly laughed
at her feeding them so strangely.

546
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,635
I'm okay...

547
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,972
-Thanks.
-Can you eat it all?

548
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,241
-No, I can't.
-I pickled two cucumbers.

549
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,143
This is enough.

550
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,512
It's dripping.

551
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,247
I can catch it.

552
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,016
Go ahead.

553
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,217
Here it comes.

554
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,885
Why hide it like that?

555
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,387
What a big load.

556
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,224
Hang on. Isn't Kurosawa laughing?

557
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,726
-She's laughing.
-What the hell?

558
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,164
-What was that?
-Why make yourself laugh?

559
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,766
She did it all by herself.

560
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,369
-She totally laughed.
-You didn't even try to hold back.

561
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:33,339
-She said, "What a big load."
-You grinned the whole time.

562
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,107
You're like newlyweds.

563
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,778
Mr. Matsumoto, she screwed up, right?

564
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:39,812
She did.

565
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,681
What was it all about?

566
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,850
-There was more than you expected?
-Yes.

567
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,552
It came out all mashed up,
so there was more than...

568
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,820
Because he chewed it.

569
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,556
Chewing things mashes them up.

570
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:53,593
Here it comes.

571
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,261
Why hide it like that?

572
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,762
What a big load.

573
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,334
-She's laughing.
-What the hell?

574
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,970
Don't talk like a prostitute.

575
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,173
-"What a big load."
-What does that mean?

576
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,776
Well, Kurosawa,
that's going to be a yellow.

577
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,411
Yes. I'm sorry. Okay.

578
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,458
-Counterattacks are scary.
-They are.

579
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,726
Got to be careful.

580
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,029
I'm very strong.

581
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,031
I have strong arms.

582
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,300
So, I'd like to pick up a man.

583
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,603
Can someone put these on for me?

584
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,805
The skinniest of you is...

585
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,574
No, I can't do it.

586
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,842
-It's Nobu.
-Nobu.

587
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,310
Kurosawa...

588
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,213
-Wait, Kurosawa. Pick Jun.
-No, that won't do.

589
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,215
-Kurosawa, wait.
-You've been chosen.

590
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:52,385
-She didn't choose me.
-You're the first person she wants.

591
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,654
I am not a good choice!

592
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,025
-Please pick Jun!
-But you've already been chosen.

593
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,094
-Do it, Nobu.
-Your junior is asking a favor.

594
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,497
-Can I take these off?
-Do it for her.

595
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,299
-My belt?
-Yes.

596
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,801
Kurosawa, you're...

597
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,370
You're...

598
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,674
You can wear them over your underwear.

599
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,944
-You're wearing polka dot underwear.
-Something is out.

600
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,111
These...

601
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,881
-I have those pants.
-Here.

602
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,849
Who cares if we have the same pants?

603
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,953
-You're so hairy!
-Doesn't Tsurutaro have the same pants?

604
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,854
No, I don't wear these and do yoga.

605
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,957
Sorry, you're too hairy.

606
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:32,725
So that's it?

607
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,694
-Can you help?
-What?

608
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,930
-I want to show how I can use my power.
-What do you mean?

609
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,131
-Your power?
-My power.

610
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,666
She says she's strong.

611
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,336
What is this? What should I do?

612
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,839
It's embarrassing, and you say
I have the same pants as Tsurutaro.

613
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,107
Wear these, Itoda.

614
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,976
Wear them for her.

615
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:53,346
-I take my pants off?
-You wear these on top of your underwear.

616
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,981
Which is the real Tsurutaro?

617
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,415
Like this?

618
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,417
Thank you very much.

619
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,020
-Are you Tsurutaro?
-He's not Tsurutaro at all.

620
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,356
I'm not Tsurutaro at all.

621
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,490
What now?

622
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:07,159
Let's pretend you came home drunk.

623
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,997
You pass after you come inside,
and I have to carry you to bed.

624
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,400
I want to show that
I can carry a man by myself...

625
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,901
That would be tough.

626
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,304
Good idea. Sounds great for a wife.

627
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:21,240
-I'd like to show everyone.
-If you can, it'll be amazing.

628
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,342
-That's what you need.
-There's a skill?

629
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,112
-Can you come in from the door?
-Am I drunk?

630
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,147
-Yes, so on the way...
-It's pretty far.

631
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,349
-Is this the path?
-Yes.

632
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,051
I'm home.

633
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,587
I'm drunk.

634
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,556
Oh, honey! How could you?

635
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,991
You're so drunk!

636
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,328
-You can't sleep here.
-Ahh, I'm so drunk!

637
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,863
Kurosawa laughed, right?

638
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,266
-Somebody laughed?
-Who was it?

639
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,336
-I think it was Itoda.
-One of them was laughing.

640
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,738
They were laughing as part of the act.

641
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,306
But just then I was...

642
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,808
I didn't laugh.

643
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,943
-Kurosawa?
-Did she laugh as she acted?

644
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,846
-Kurosawa laughed?
-No way! She did it again?

645
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,516
-When she said, "Oh, honey."
-That's out too?

646
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,384
That's not allowed either.

647
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,153
-Probably.
-I think you're right.

648
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,588
She was laughing like normal.

649
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,893
-I see.
-He said that would count too.

650
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,896
I'm home.

651
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,432
I'm drunk.

652
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:22,401
Oh, honey! How could you?

653
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,836
You're so drunk!

654
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,039
-You can't sleep here.
-Ahh, I'm so drunk!

655
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,407
I am so drunk.

656
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,642
That was...

657
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,709
-Well.
-Yeah.

658
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:31,777
I'm sorry.

659
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,212
Orange?

660
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,915
-You're on thin ice now.
-Okay.

661
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,650
-Next is red.
-You'll be out next.

662
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:39,051
You're in real danger.

663
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,252
I understand.

664
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,990
-Scary.
-We're safe now.

665
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,092
Right now, yeah.

666
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,860
You can't even have a smile.

667
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,362
I don't want it to end
without doing anything.

668
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,597
That might happen.

669
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:54,266
-That's very possible.
-It is.

670
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,435
-May I?
-You want to do it again?

671
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:57,703
We'll do it again.

672
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,538
-Sorry for pushing you.
-It's fine.

673
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,173
-Be careful.
-When you act, too.

674
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,241
Don't laugh.

675
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,412
Right here...

676
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,414
Put this through...

677
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,316
What a day!

678
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,053
-Like this.
-She put a lock on him.

679
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,521
Excuse me.

680
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,923
I lift this, like so...

681
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,391
Ahh, I drank too much.

682
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,027
He fell over.

683
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,563
What's this?

684
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,102
It's a bit different from when...

685
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,773
-You can lift people up like that?
-Wow!

686
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,511
-Watch out.
-How will she move?

687
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:43,015
-Did you screw up?
-No, but he's heavier than I expected.

688
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,017
-I see.
-I'm pretty heavy, actually.

689
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,553
-Kurosawa, what are you doing?
-Sorry, I just...

690
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,588
I wanted to show off my strength.

691
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,123
That's impossible.

692
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,992
It should be someone lighter.

693
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,294
-How far did she go?
-You crushed my balls.

694
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,462
How far did she go?

695
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:57,863
From there.

696
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,099
One banana, two bananas...

697
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,767
Can you bring more bananas?

698
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:04,870
-I wonder how far she got.
-Are there more bananas?

699
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,039
Why are you measuring with bananas?

700
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,743
-Iio, no more bananas. We don't get it.
-You don't get it?

701
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,078
We normally talk about length in meters.

702
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,248
-Not in bananas.
-We don't know what several bananas make.

703
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,816
-Stop it, Iio.
-Stop what?

704
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,120
"Fruit samurai."

705
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,454
What the hell?

706
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:27,793
Okay.

707
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,564
"Mother of Fruit."

708
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,134
-It's a character from Ultraman.
-Ultraman. Okay.

709
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,202
"Fruit Taro."

710
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,037
-Ultraman.
-Something's wrong.

711
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,806
But it's not fruit.
You can't make it a "fruit" series.

712
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:43,509
-You have bananas, not fruit.
-Aren't they fruit?

713
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:45,244
Well, bananas are fruit, but...

714
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,613
Taro is the only real son of Ultraman.

715
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,681
That's right.

716
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,250
-What about the others?
-Yes?

717
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,286
They're relatives and such.

718
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,056
"Kankichi Ryotsu."

719
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:58,157
Wow.

720
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,759
-"Fruit Kankichi."
-You're right. "Fruit Kankichi."

721
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,696
-Why keep the "Ryotsu"?
-Don't say, "You're right."

722
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,065
-What have you been doing?
-What did I do?

723
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,200
-Until now.
-I was playing with bananas...

724
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,268
Since you debuted.

725
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,570
I just made a mistake. How sad.

726
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,039
"Why, oh why? Fruity why."

727
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,545
"Bonk my eyeball."

728
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,413
-That's scary.
-It's not good.

729
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,048
That's too scary. Do one more.

730
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,251
-You can do it. Come on.
-Huh?

731
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,952
-Keep it coming.
-Keep it coming?

732
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,921
They'll come. There's more coming now.

733
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:42,868
Nipple beams, they point outwards, heart

734
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,272
You laughed.

735
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,441
You laugh at nipple beams?

736
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:52,211
Fujimoto, that was a laugh!

737
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:53,812
It doesn't make sense!

738
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,682
-What was that?
-Sorry?

739
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,051
-What were you doing?
-He did "Nipple beams."

740
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,519
After they pointed sideways!

741
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,688
They go outwards, then "Heart."

742
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,056
But that's just...

743
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,258
You put the pressure on him yourself.

744
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,095
Why, after so long,
would you fall for something so basic?

745
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,565
Losing to something so basic.

746
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:14,967
It was...

747
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,270
I couldn't hold it in.

748
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,073
-Kurochan's dangerous when under pressure.
-Exactly.

749
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,611
Fujimoto's already close here.

750
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,550
Nipple beams, they point outwards, heart

751
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,455
You can't take something like that
straight on.

752
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,459
-You have to dodge it.
-You took it in the face.

753
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,862
It came in full force.

754
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,900
It was so close to this...

755
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,704
But it's this. By a hair.

756
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,672
-You were almost done for.
-Close.

757
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,275
Kurochan gets a lot of points for that.

758
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,243
-Thank you.
-That's right.

759
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,946
-He got points, too.
-You're right.

760
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,751
Here we go.

761
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,925
Don't pressure Kurochan.

762
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,128
-The banana thing came from Iio.
-Iio, please stop it.

763
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,164
I was trying to set up something
for myself, but...

764
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,935
Everyone, if you don't mind,
could you all gather around?

765
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:24,636
-Here they come.
-What?

766
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,605
-I have ghost photos.
-Here they come!

767
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:28,540
-Ghost photos?
-You can't use them!

768
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,843
-Seriously?
-Don't do that bit again!

769
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,745
-Here they come!
-You said they bomb.

770
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,748
-You can't. It's impossible not to laugh.
-Just say no.

771
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,717
-Drop it. Not this time.
-But these ones are really scary.

772
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,520
-There's no way they're scary.
-It's true.

773
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,555
Even if they're scary, I'll laugh.

774
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,324
Exactly.

775
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,459
Let's not.

776
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,298
Is that face okay?

777
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,835
Did I make a weird face?

778
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,313
Kukky really likes those teeth.

779
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,418
Kawashima, that's no good.

780
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:16,221
-It's no good.
-Yeah.

781
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,856
No good at all.

782
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:19,458
That is...

783
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,560
That is absolutely bad.

784
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,797
Who are you trying to be?
You often do that, but who is it?

785
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,533
-Whose teeth are they?
-My grandpa's.

786
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,735
-His real teeth?
-Your grandpa's?

787
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,571
-That's scary.
-Don't bring real teeth.

788
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,939
He's still alive.

789
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,441
He's still alive?

790
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,443
Can I show you some ghost photos?

791
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,512
We're not all present.

792
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,080
Wait till everyone can see it.

793
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,116
-Put them away for now.
-Seriously.

794
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,184
My bad.

795
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,552
Put them away.

796
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,120
I really can't look at them.

797
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,421
They aren't ghosts.

798
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,590
They are. Look, they're very creepy.

799
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,759
-Here.
-When everyone is here.

800
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,395
-Wait till everyone's here.
-It's too soon for this.

801
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:59,331
-Exactly. It's too early.
-This one's bad too.

802
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,733
Show them later.
There's another Master here.

803
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,705
-We won't laugh at your Master character.
-Wait. Not just now...

804
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,875
-It's not the time for that.
-Not now.

805
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,878
We won't laugh at your Master bit.

806
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,513
Really?

807
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,649
-Your buckle was a hamburger patty?
-Yes, it is.

808
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,286
-Let me try it later.
-Chicken meatballs!

809
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,021
-He lives in Roppongi.
-Wow.

810
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,291
He came all the way to Osaka
for a drink dressed just like that.

811
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,126
-Wow.
-The thing was,

812
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,695
no one laughed.

813
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,763
-Wow. Really?
-Yeah.

814
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,599
No one in Roppongi laughed.

815
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,601
Is that possible?

816
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,503
This town hasn't changed!

817
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,504
There he goes.

818
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:40,806
What's the matter?

819
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,610
Stop looking at me like
I'm just a vegetable garnish.

820
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,511
We're not.

821
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,012
Have you forgotten?

822
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,780
It's me.

823
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,216
I'm Master Hamburg!

824
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:56,154
Now, I'll offer you hungry folks
100 grams of sizzling meat.

825
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,393
I was relaxing at home the other day
when my mother said to me,

826
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,829
"How long do you plan
to keep fooling around?

827
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,831
"Why don't you get a job?

828
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,366
"You're Hamburg, right?"

829
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,267
"I am."

830
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,002
"You'll 'meat' the criteria."

831
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,137
Hamburg!

832
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,539
He's so noisy.

833
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,208
-He's too loud.
-He sure has a big voice.

834
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,810
-Coming up next is...
-Here's your audience.

835
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,846
"Challenge Hamburger."

836
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,919
Challenge hamburger?

837
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,420
Is it interactive?

838
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,522
Please look here.

839
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:35,427
This is the dinner menu at
the hamburger restaurant Gold Rush.

840
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,895
I prepared it myself.

841
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,599
There are 14 items on the menu.

842
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:46,171
"Fourteen" is "ju-shi." Sounds juicy.

843
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,074
Hamburg!

844
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,145
Now comes the highlight
of "Challenge Hamburger."

845
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,713
This bit is too long.

846
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,848
-So long.
-He's tough.

847
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,417
He didn't laugh at the photos.

848
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,286
-Now, this...
-I could see through the photo myself.

849
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,789
Now I'm going to...

850
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,223
Please, Miyasako.

851
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,425
Can you hold this?

852
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:08,293
What?

853
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,597
I'm going to read
this Gold Rush dinner menu

854
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,666
as fast as I can. All 14 items.

855
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,670
Can you time me?

856
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,840
-That's what this is about?
-How long will it take?

857
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,008
We'll see.

858
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,010
Let's begin.

859
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,546
Challenge Hamburger, ready, start!

860
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,481
Gold Rush hamburger,

861
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,950
teriyaki hamburger,
hamburger with grated radish,

862
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,086
teriyaki and cheddar cheese hamburger,

863
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,021
West and East hamburger.

864
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:37,522
Japanese Special hamburger,

865
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,758
Cowboy hamburger, half-and-half hamburger,

00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,960
double cheese hamburger, garlic hamburger,

867
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,562
garlic and cheese hamburger,

868
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,230
hamburger with grilled tomatoes,

869
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,733
Triple Rush hamburger, garlic diced steak!

870
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,068
Time?

871
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:50,969
Two seconds.

872
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,639
It was 14 seconds.

873
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,407
Juicy.

874
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,542
Hamburg!

875
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,878
He said two seconds.

876
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:01,880
It was two seconds.

877
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,216
Not your punchline?

878
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,952
You don't often see outfits like this.

879
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:10,322
-You're the only one I see like that.
-I see it very often.

880
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,228
I bet you don't see me like this often.

881
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,397
-I see it often.
-Very often.

882
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:19,898
You came here like that.

883
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,933
-From Osaka?
-Yeah.

884
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,002
-Like this?
-No, no.

885
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,370
Like this?

886
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,571
Both hands?

887
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:28,674
Yeah.

888
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,076
Or like this?

889
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,813
Beautiful.

890
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,148
Good course.

891
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,549
Nice swing.

892
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:38,650
Good, good.

893
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,154
Can you mimic some famous ball players?

894
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:44,990
Name some.

895
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,260
-You can?
-How about Ichiro?

896
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,661
He's left-handed.

897
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,532
But I'm right-handed.

898
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,835
As long as it looks like him.

899
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,805
It's not him at all.

900
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:00,906
Ichiro...

901
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,808
Doesn't he do this?

902
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,743
But Ichiro is left-handed, so...

903
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,112
I prefer right-handed ones.

904
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,580
Swinging right-handed...

905
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,882
-Someone unique...
-Ogasawara.

906
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,984
He has a unique motion.

907
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,720
He's left-handed too, isn't he?

908
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,823
-The Dragons' second team coach?
-Yeah, left.

909
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,391
But he's unique.

910
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,126
But I'm right-handed.

911
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,794
Try doing it right-handed.

912
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,430
It's the same.

913
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,700
That's not it. Mimic Ogasawara.

914
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,168
How about Matsui?

915
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,903
He's left-handed, too.

916
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,372
Do it right-handed.
As long as you look like him.

917
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,241
Like so...

918
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:37,275
We mean Kazuo.

919
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,510
Kazuyo?

920
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,113
"O"?

921
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,614
Kazu...

922
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,116
Yo.

923
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,350
Kazuyo?

924
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,553
Kazuyo Matsui's swing?

925
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,758
Like the videos she posted online.

926
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,328
Like a "What if" series?
"What if Kazuyo Matsui did..."

927
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,463
"What if Kazuyo Matsui swung a bat?"

928
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:03,101
-Would YouTube do?
-"What if she swung a bat on YouTube?"

929
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,703
The way she does, you know.

930
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,071
That pleading look.

931
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,473
-"I am..."
-Hands here.

932
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:10,675
That's pretty.

933
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,644
-"I am..."
-You're pretty.

934
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,480
"...truly in great pain."

935
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:16,748
You're pretty.

936
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,151
"What would happen if I,

937
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,253
"in this painful situation,

938
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,421
"was to swing a bat?

939
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,423
"Please watch."

940
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,263
So pretty.

941
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,598
What a beautiful swing.

942
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,500
Kazuyo's swing is beautiful.

943
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:38,103
Kazuyo can swing really hard.

944
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,404
Kazuyo can really swing.

945
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:40,872
Kazuyo can swing, right?

946
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,207
Swing it.

947
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,844
It was more emotional in the beginning
when his hands were crossed.

948
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:47,112
Yeah.

949
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,480
You should try it more...

950
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,849
More like Sarah Connor from
The Terminator when

951
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,118
-she talks to her son.
-Brings back memories.

952
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,387
I don't watch videos much.

953
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,322
-No Sarah Connor?
-Sarah Connor?

954
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,291
She says to John Connor, "John,

955
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,593
"if you're watching this,

956
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:03,528
"it means..."

957
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,597
Kazuyo was wearing the same tank top.

958
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:06,932
The exact same?

959
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,700
Not the exact same.

960
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:11,937
"You are..."

961
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,876
Can I show the ghost photos now?
You haven't seen them.

962
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:21,279
-Kurosawa isn't here.
-She's preparing? Okay, let's wait.

963
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,649
-I've seen glimpses of her the whole time.
-As she prepared.

964
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,053
Hello, hello, hello.

965
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,789
I'm Mao Daichi.

966
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,357
How are you?

967
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,095
Well...

968
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,397
I'm Mao Daichi.

969
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,367
Evil spirits!

970
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,269
Evil spirits!

971
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,639
Evil spirits!
I'll exorcise the evil spirits!

972
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,509
Evil spirits! Right there.

973
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:55,146
Evil spirit!
I'll drive the evil spirit out of you!

974
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,449
Evil spirits follow you.

975
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,185
So many evil spirits.

976
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:08,727
That'll do.

977
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,033
The evil spirits.

978
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:20,605
Evil spirits!

979
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,475
Evil spirits!

980
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,143
Evil spirits!

981
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:28,680
So many evil spirits.

982
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,382
Evil spirits.

983
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:34,019
Evil spirits, evil spirits. Wait a minute.

984
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,292
How can she talk so loud?

985
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,596
Wow.

986
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,497
Scary.

987
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:46,998
Evil spirits.

988
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,368
This.

989
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,636
This.

990
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,806
This. There. Can you grab that side?

991
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,475
And here.

992
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,178
Thank you.

993
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,456
Straddle Time!

994
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,626
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

995
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,995
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

996
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,597
Straddle Time!

997
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,467
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

998
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,803
Can you, Straddle Time, hold it?

999
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:32,410
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

1000
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,313
It's Straddle Time! Straddle Time!

1001
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,882
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

1002
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,018
Straddle Time!

1003
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:44,856
We know it's that time, too.

1004
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,394
Hold on a sec.

1005
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,033
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

1006
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,634
This is tough.

1007
00:43:56,935 --> 00:44:00,505
Wait a minute! Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

1008
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,344
Did Kurosawa laugh at herself?

1009
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,380
Maybe she laughed in the back.

1010
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,748
Was it me?

1011
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:10,915
Did you laugh again?

1012
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,917
I don't know. Maybe I did.

1013
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,986
Look at that outfit.

1014
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,955
What's with that wig?

1015
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,090
If Kurosawa laughed, she's in trouble.

1016
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,960
-Who was it?
-Was Kurosawa on an orange card?

1017
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,162
This one was close the whole time.

1018
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,898
But it seems they couldn't hold it
any longer.

1019
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:29,267
Iio.

1020
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:33,304
-It was Iio?
-Now that I think about it...

1021
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,141
I'm sorry.
When she was doing Straddle Time,

1022
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:39,644
it was the vibration on the rope
when she rubbed it that got me.

1023
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,080
That friction...

1024
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:44,883
Ah, Straddle Time!

1025
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,519
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

1026
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,988
Straddle Time!

1027
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:51,489
Hold on a sec.

1028
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:54,759
This is tough.

1029
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,563
He's laughing. He sure was.

1030
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,765
That was...

1031
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,334
-I'm sorry.
-That was, well...

1032
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:05,136
Yellow, I guess.

1033
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,404
Yeah, yellow.

1034
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:08,073
-Thank you.
-Sorry.

1035
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,074
Oh, man.

1036
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,476
-So many people are on the ropes.
-It's scary.

1037
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:14,312
Really, more and more of you are
on the edge.

1038
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,388
What happened to the ghost photos?

1039
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,657
-Want to take a look?
-Should we?

1040
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,059
-If you like.
-You haven't finished yet, right?

1041
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,160
Not yet.

1042
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:32,464
-Kurosawa, can you sprinkle salt on these?
-Oh, sure.

1043
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:35,400
You might drive away the spirits
from the photos.

1044
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,137
-It's salt I used earlier.
-Not a problem. Looks like it's working.

1045
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:41,739
-Pardon me.
-Oh, that's great!

1046
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:45,577
Thanks a lot.

1047
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:49,280
-They're ghost photos?
-Yes, and they're exorcised.

1048
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:50,915
But they're still the same.

1049
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:53,251
He looked normal when they were taken.

1050
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,888
-Photos of a Master?
-Yeah. Daisuke & Hanako.

1051
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:02,927
-The photo looks better than before.
-His head's small.

1052
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,296
-His head's really small.
-He has no neck.

1053
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,298
-The ghosts did it?
-It's the ghosts.

1054
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:08,533
His head's so small.

1055
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,969
-You exorcised them?
-They're not normal yet.

1056
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:14,806
-What genre of ghost photos are these?
-Which of them is possessed?

1057
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,141
Daisuke?

1058
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,308
Obviously Hanako.

1059
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,110
-Really?
-Not Master Daisuke?

1060
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:20,178
Hanako seems normal.

1061
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:23,448
Master Hanako's the possessed one.
Look. That's a possessed face.

1062
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,817
Master Hanako is possessed?

1063
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,119
Something looks shrunken.

1064
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,155
Look closely.

1065
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,090
-I'm looking.
-We are.

1066
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,692
-I'm looking. I'm looking.
-No, he's not.

1067
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,594
Miyasako's looking over here.

1068
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,163
No, I'm looking.

1069
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:40,064
-This one's a portrait.
-I'm looking.

1070
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,232
A portrait?

1071
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:47,672
I'm looking.

1072
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:50,542
-I am looking.
-You are an idiot.

1073
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,578
I brought collectible photos
for each of you.

1074
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:55,580
-Collectible photos?
-For each of us?

1075
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,248
Don't give them out.

1076
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,551
-Each of us?
-Individually?

1077
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:01,019
Each of you will get one.

1078
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,520
Don't give them to everyone.

1079
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:05,356
Give them first
to those that don't have cards yet.

1080
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,760
-Those with cards get one later.
-Please.

1081
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,563
-Who has a card now?
-I'm really sorry. Please.

1082
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,830
-Please.
-Who's...

1083
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,065
-I have a card.
-Me too.

1084
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:15,200
I have one, too.

1085
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,302
-Me too. Yellow.
-Yellow.

1086
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,436
I beg you.

1087
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:22,106
-I guess that's the right way.
-I'm sorry for this. You know.

1088
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,042
Why start here?

1089
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,910
Are you stupid?

1090
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,779
-You heard us.
-Those people!

1091
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:28,980
That way!

1092
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:31,883
-Those without cards.
-Why don't you look at it yourself?

1093
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,785
Here.

1094
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,354
No, Kukky. Seriously.

1095
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:38,056
We'll all be done for!

1096
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,658
-All of us here will be out!
-It will be over!

1097
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,528
-Choose a representative.
-Let's not do that.

1098
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:46,197
-On this side we're...
-Don't slide it in.

1099
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,766
WHEN WOMEN BARF, I GET A BONER - DAISUKE

1100
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,236
-I was scolded for sliding things.
-By a Master?

1101
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,738
Wait, wait, Kukky.

1102
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,509
Read the captions.

1103
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,349
-Is it a true story?
-It is.

1104
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,217
Take a good look.

1105
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:07,485
Look.

1106
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:12,590
WHEN MY WIFE CAUGHT ME HUMPING,
I NEARLY DIED - DAISUKE

1107
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:15,159
-Are you looking?
-No, Fujimoto isn't looking.

1108
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:17,428
Take a good look.

1109
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,364
Nobu's not looking either.

1110
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,598
Take a good look.

1111
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,400
I'm looking. I'm looking!

1112
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,235
This shouldn't be a problem.

1113
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:28,973
I'LL GET 100,000 YEN TO EAT THESE FECES?
BON APPETIT - DAISUKE

1114
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:36,748
Take a proper look, Nobu.

1115
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:39,517
-What kind of face is that?
-Please don't say Nobu.

1116
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:40,918
That face is no good.

1117
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,421
-Look. That's not fair.
-Nobu?

1118
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,390
Nobu, look.

1119
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:52,830
I THINK I WAS 40 WHEN I HAD
THAT VASECTOMY - DAISUKE

1120
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,667
Nobu, look properly.

1121
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,269
-You're not...
-I'm looking!

1122
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:01,306
-Nobu, look.
-I did. It's about the vasectomy.

1123
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:02,707
-Nobu.
-Yes.

1124
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:04,709
The new ones are...

1125
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:09,947
Wait!

1126
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:12,717
Wait a minute, please!

1127
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,486
Everyone... You're all...

1128
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,155
That one was...

1129
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,890
It was undeniable!

1130
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:20,358
It was undeniable.

1131
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:23,995
-Enough with the cards.
-I can't believe it!

1132
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:25,596
That was...

1133
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,231
Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Matsumoto...

1134
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,167
-It was undeniable.
-You laughed.

1135
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,903
What was that "kaan"?

1136
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,506
-We've never heard that one before.
-"Kaan!"

1137
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,109
You said "kaan!"

1138
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,211
Mr. Matsumoto, this is...

1139
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,347
It's impossible not to laugh at this.

1140
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,317
"I'm gonna buy some Yomeishu."
That's the only thing he'd really say!

1141
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:49,053
The most normal phrase
became the funniest.

1142
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,621
It hit me like a body blow.

1143
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:53,524
I'm looking!

1144
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:56,594
-Nobu, look.
-I did. It's about the vasectomy.

1145
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:57,662
-Nobu.
-Yes.

1146
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,064
The new ones are...

1147
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,936
That's safe, right?

1148
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:07,505
Mr. Matsumoto!

1149
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,408
That's safe, right?

1150
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,510
That was the highest form of laughter.

1151
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:14,946
What the hell was that?

1152
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,281
-Orange.
-Thank you!

1153
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,983
Now you're really on the ropes.

1154
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:22,086
-You got orange. No more chances.
-Okay.

1155
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,427
It's somewhere near here.

1156
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:32,597
Yeah, I should do something.

1157
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,034
-Wow.
-It's not ice. What?

1158
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,870
A lot of white smoke's coming out.
