1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I think you should do it again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
From the top of your head?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You're so fluffy.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I can't do it. My legs are so stiff.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll do it again.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
From the side.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think it's better to do it again.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The first time, at the Gagi no Tsukai Arai,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Chikichiki Yamazaki Hoosei presents,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
The world's first, no one knows the loss!

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Please, raise your hand.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What is this?

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
No one knows the loss.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't need a laugh like this!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's explain in place of Yama-chan.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This time, it's a battle that will never end.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The winner will receive a luxury item, and the winner will be treated by a special guest.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Today, we have a wonderful guest who is celebrating his 30th anniversary.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is there such a person?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Of course there is.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But why are we here?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's because we are friends.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Friends?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We've been friends for 15 years.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This year is our 17th anniversary.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's been 17 years.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're slow.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm cold!

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to the toilet!

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you have the guts, go and do it!

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're too much of a fricador, you're going to the toilet too.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you have the guts, go and do it. If you don't, don't.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why are you coming?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the entertainment industry,

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we've come to see the beauty of the industry.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wada Akihiko-san!

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nocchi-san!

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't want to explain it normally.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wonder what's going on behind me.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to kill you.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to kill you.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you very much.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is it?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is it?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Wada-san has celebrated his 30th anniversary!

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
30th anniversary!

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Congratulations!

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Congratulations!

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's amazing!

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's been 30 years!

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wada Akiko is the super big star who is celebrating his 30th anniversary this year.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He has always been the top of the entertainment industry since his debut.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He is the super big star who has taken over the Kouhaku's bird.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you!

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Today is the farewell party.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey!

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's wrong?

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey!

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It hurts!

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a gorilla.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's going to break.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We've been together for 30 years.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's double.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't like it.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's going up.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Who are you talking to?

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you ready?

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We're going to meet with Mr. Zantaro.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
The winner will receive a luxurious prize!

74
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,500
The winner will receive a set of Omi beef from Asakusa Imai in the year of the ox.

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
The loser will receive a huge gift.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Akko-san's huge gift!

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
The gift for the loser is this!

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
A bow from the heart!

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I don't want to do it.

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Why?

81
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Why?

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
It's a punishment game, right?

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a punishment game!

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is...

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why are we here celebrating our 30th anniversary and getting punished?

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No one is losing!

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No one is losing!

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why is it like this?

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Onii-san, you know...

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Onii-san, you're wrong!

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not like that!

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's here!

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's not here, it's here!

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't do that, you're so mean!

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I saw the shape of the cake!

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's already our 30th anniversary!

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's night time!

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not going to do it anymore.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not going to edit it.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There is no problem with this.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Akiko, please be more beautiful than you are now.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know that?

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know what you mean.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know what beauty is.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To polish it even more, we need to do a color change!

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's not happening!

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's do it

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Really?

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It can't be helped

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is the color change

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then, color change

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wait for me

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go!

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The first round is...

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The winner is...

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The fastest sneeze battle!

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll make a small ring and the winner will sneeze first.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's start.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The fastest sneeze battle!

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Ready...

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Go!

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If I don't sneeze, the gorilla will be waiting for me.

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A beautiful baby is waiting for you

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is so sour

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't follow me!

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm a man!

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't follow me!

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I thought a gorilla was coming

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sorry, I can't do this

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's true.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not coming out.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's not coming out at all.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There's no sign of it coming out.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah! It's coming out!

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's coming out!

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's coming out!

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You should have just put it in!

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You should have just put it in!

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you holding this for?

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's amazing.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This game is a draw!

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We won!

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We have prepared the next game.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's over?

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's over.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Which game?

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Which game?

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Look at my bad body.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go to the next game.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The next game is...

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We are the third?

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The battle of despair and hanging down!

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The battle of despair and hanging down.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is a physical game that the two are not good at.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The one who hangs down longer wins.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The battle of hanging despair!

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ready!

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is tough.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's 35, you two.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you okay?

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Huh?

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's still 20, 25 seconds!

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's 26 seconds!

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you okay?

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm serious.

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you very much.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Please be serious.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Old friend.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait, wait, wait!

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I won!

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I won!

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll do it again.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you doing?

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I won!

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wait, wait, wait!

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you!

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's cold!

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's have him on the stage!

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a little bit noisy

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's Akko-san!

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Please come on out!

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Akko-san!

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Akko-san!

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a bondage!

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Akko-san, listen!

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Come on!

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then, Akko-san,

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Please do the chest dance!

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I want you! I want you!

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How was it?

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't remember my childhood

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What a great girl

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What a great girl

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How to say it

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The style is not bad

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What is bad?

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Nothing is bad

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's go to the second round

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The winner will receive a diamond watch as a gift.

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And the winner is this!

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A kiss mark on the wrist.

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can I wear this?

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Of course.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You wear it for three days.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Have you ever worn it?

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm looking forward to it.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is the first time I've seen Akiko-san wearing a mask.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
She's a top-notch entertainer.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Akiko-san, please come back.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My black-haired badminton match!

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm confident about this.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're lucky.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll explain the rules.

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You'll do this, right?

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Put the ball in the basket.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When the ball is in the basket, you'll start the baton.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
OK. Rock, paper, scissors.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ready, start!

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have to sing.

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's coming.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's still okay.

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This voice is cold.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why is this?

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The voice is coming out.

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Do it again.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What the hell!

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's do it again!

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's do it again!

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What kind of attitude is that?

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know.

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What?

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't think I can jump that high.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No, no, no.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm the one who's going to win.

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please listen to Yamazaki-san.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
1-0.

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay, then.

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It was too early.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Too early.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll go first.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hanada, you go first.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's go.

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't lose.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's still okay, it's still okay!

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I touched it! I touched it! I touched it!

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I touched it! I touched it!

251
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm a fan of Aki!

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No way!

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You didn't even touch the net!

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's not right!

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hamada-san wins!

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What?

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why?

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No way!

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The game is over.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Nyan, please come out.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Please come out!

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Akko-san, please come out!

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't do this!

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you doing?

266
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't do this!

267
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is a dream of a man!

268
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The manly y-shirt!

269
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Acco-san, thank you for making my dream come true!

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wait a minute.

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're so hard-working!

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wait a minute.

274
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're pointing at me!

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't use standard Japanese!

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Come on!

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll help you.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What is this? It's a celebration for the 20th anniversary, you idiot!

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Even in the comic, you can't dress like this!

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you wear this kind of cap, it's been about 25 years!

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You should try becoming one of our mini-bosses!

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll be done soon, so come!

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't do that!

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Be quiet!

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's so funny!

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm really listening to you! I'm really listening to you!

287
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This is the best!

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is the best!

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey!

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey!

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hey!

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey!

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Hey!

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why are you going back so slowly?

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Your face is blue!

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm going home now.

297
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm going home now.

298
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're going to the apartment?

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know, when I was being beaten up, I was really scared.

300
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I was really scared.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was really scared.

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was sitting in the middle of the street, and I was completely covered in blood.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was sitting in the middle of the street, and I was completely covered in blood.

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That was wonderful!

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's go to the third round!

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The winner will receive a diamond ring from the shining star of the Kinshichi TV.

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And from Akiko!

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Deep kiss!

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If I get a deep kiss on my head, I'll have multiple personalities.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You'll have multiple personalities?

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll have another personality.

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wait a minute. What about my will?

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What's the point of celebrating 30 years?

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm just doing it.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Look at the two of you. How cool are you?

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's wonderful.

317
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Where is it?

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're one of the three most beautiful people in the world.

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What's going on with my feelings?

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you talking about?

321
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Finally, Mr. Akutani, the color correction is amazing.

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Everyone is so beautiful that they say,

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What are you doing?

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, this is fine.

325
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why are you so cold?

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I want you to do something good.

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If I were a monkey, I would have run away from the fire.

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I can't do it anymore.

329
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's okay. We'll do it again.

330
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We'll do it again.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Do your best.

332
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Do your best.

333
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you.

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Deep kiss?

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Deep kiss.

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll chase after you.

337
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll go after you.

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yama-chan's painting song!

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
In the third round, the two of them will draw a picture at the same time to match Yama-chan's painting song.

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The winner will decide which one is better.

341
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The third round goes to Yama-chan!

342
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's good, isn't it?

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If you push the button, what will happen in a flash?

344
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't understand anything!

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why can you laugh at this?

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The answer is this!

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
King!

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Haaaaaaa!

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How do you write it? Can you repeat it?

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The banana peel was falling down

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Three beans were falling

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It was locked up in a goldfish tank

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And water was being born

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't get it!

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
When you covered it with a pin

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A pin?

357
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's start with Matsumoto-san.

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You write like this, right?

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But this is a bit like a king, right?

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No, it's not.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's close to this, right?

362
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes, if you say that, the face is close.

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's close? You said it's close.

364
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll decide after looking at Hamazawa-san.

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hamazawa-san's face.

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Please, come in!

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is...

368
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What is this?!

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is...

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait, wait, wait!

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're still cute!

372
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're still cute!

373
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're still cute!

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're still cute!

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Wait, wait, wait!

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I shouldn't have written this!

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Get out of my way!

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I shouldn't have written this!

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's right, you shouldn't have written that.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ah, this is bad!

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

382
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hamada-san, deep kiss!

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know! It's not changing!

384
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hamada-chan, kiss!

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Akko's deep kiss is coming!

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Akko-san's color change is over!

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Akko-san, please!

388
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why?

389
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why?

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm scared!

391
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm laughing!

392
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And finally, Seijin...

393
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Again, you're wearing a wedding dress!

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And finally...

395
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait a minute.

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're holding a bow.

397
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm so jealous.

398
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm so jealous.

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm so jealous.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Akiko-san!

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wait a minute.

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This is...

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What's wrong?

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I have a stomachache.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're a middle schooler.

406
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're in first grade?

407
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is the best!

408
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is the best!

409
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This kind of thing, rather than women doing it, men should do it.

410
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What is this?

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Do you want to open it?

412
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll close it.

413
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a peach!

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Why?

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't say no!

416
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Do it gently.

417
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's fine if you open it like this.

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Ah, under the hammer?

419
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You knocked him down with your knee.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wait!

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It can't be helped if you lose.

422
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It can't be helped if I lose.

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:44,080
It's a

424
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's a

425
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's get on this.

426
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I see.

427
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I see.

428
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I see.

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You lead.

430
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So, Katariko.

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm a real one.

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's the reality.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Reality.

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It hurts, right?

435
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's the reality.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I really have to do it.

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Can I just stay still?

438
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Of course.

439
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's Deep Kiss.

440
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm so happy!

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm so happy!

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm so happy!

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Cut!

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't laugh!

445
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't laugh!

446
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Cut!

447
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't laugh!

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Cut!

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Cut!

450
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't laugh!

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't laugh!

452
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't usually do this!

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're making me dizzy.

454
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're making me dizzy.

455
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're making me dizzy.

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay, then, deep kicks!

457
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Welcome!

458
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh!

459
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was serious!

460
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I was surprised!

461
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's been a long time!

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Can't we do this in a series?

463
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Why?

464
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What kind of series is this?

465
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Please forgive me!

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Please forgive me!

467
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Please cut this out!

468
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then please go home!

469
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Don't come near me!
