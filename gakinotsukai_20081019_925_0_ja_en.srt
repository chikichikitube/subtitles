1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The Beijing Olympics in August

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Kitajima Kosuke, start!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The gold medal in the world record of the swimming athlete, Kitajima, is new to everyone's memory

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And here is another man, challenging the world record

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was told to do the high jump

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wonder how it would be if I could record it for an hour.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The pride of the Endo-chozo, Endo Takeshi.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He has been active in various scenes, but it took him 30 minutes to record all of them.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I've never seen anyone record an hour.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I want to be the first to beat Takeshi in the world record.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Will Takeshi be able to beat Takeshi in one hour?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The 3600 second miracle, Takeshi Endo challenges the world record.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But Matsumoto-san, this is a reckless challenge.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, there are many challenges in the world, but I think this challenge is very reckless.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What do you think, Ayakata?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When I first said this, I thought, can I really do it?

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How about you, Yama-chan?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think it's hard to talk for 60 minutes.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wonder if it's okay.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He is a very calm person.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He was calling Tokyo Walker in the dressing room.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think that's why he's so calm.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think he's going to do it.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can I call Endo?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's already in a different place.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Endo!

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good evening.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you ready?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you to the people who gave us this opportunity.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Downtown, Hajime, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, and the staff. Thank you very much.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm worried if it's really okay.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Even B-boy Takeshi hasn't done this before.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There is only one rule for this challenge.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
More than 10 seconds of silence is forbidden.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At that point, the challenge will fail.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it was a failure.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And then, in the last 5 minutes, he went to the studio and made a world record in front of the members.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think Takeshi-san will be silent for more than 10 seconds.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Please give me a cheer!

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the season when we can't do anything.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's right.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's always this season.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's this time of the year. I guess you're curious about the change of seasons.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Endo, who has been given a means to communicate, cannot know the situation of the studio.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Endo Takeshi's lonely battle will open the curtain.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ready!

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's starting!

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's going on?

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Duncan!

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's going on?

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You know what?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Duncan, you bastard!

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Huh?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't have to say it over and over again, Duncan!

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What the hell are you?

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What the hell are you?

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What the hell are you?

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If this happens, we can't do anything.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We can't help you.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you know who you are?

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,780
You are a

67
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,780
Is it okay?

68
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,780
You talk too much, can you sleep at this pace?

69
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Turn the car!

70
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Turn the car!

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,780
I'm waiting for you!

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,780
You have time to end the video.

73
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,780
I have time to finish the video.

74
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,780
Why are you saying that?

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,780
What are you saying?

76
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,780
I've been eating since I was a kid.

77
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,780
Are you still a kid?

78
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
I don't know.

79
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,780
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Why are you so angry?

81
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Why are you angry?

82
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't take it off.

83
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,780
You don't listen to Shio.

84
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,780
I'm eating.

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,780
My car is there, isn't it?

86
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,780
What kind of image do you have?

87
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,780
You know my car, don't you?

88
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
Let's go, Mahoto.

89
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,780
What? What? What?

90
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,780
I don't have such a car.

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
What are you doing now?

92
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
Turn it quickly.

93
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,780
I've done a lot of things.

94
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,780
What's your car?

95
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,780
Mentally, mentally, it shouldn't be abnormal.

96
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Turn it quickly.

97
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
But my family is watching.

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
You're still talking.

99
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,780
They're watching and they're watching with faith.

100
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
I told you to turn the car around.

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
You're still talking.

102
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,780
It's a car.

103
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
Your voice is a little...

104
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
You heard me?

105
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
You're in trouble.

106
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
I told you to turn the car around.

107
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,780
Turn it around quickly.

108
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
This is really tough.

109
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
You have some time.

110
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,780
I'll order you ice coffee at Konjakuwan.

111
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,280
Taka.

112
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Call TMC.

113
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,780
Taka.

114
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,780
I'm telling you to order me ice coffee at Konjakuwan.

115
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Taka-san, you still haven't ordered me ice coffee.

116
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,780
Even if you want me to turn the car around, you should order me ice coffee, you bastard.

117
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,780
Hurry up and turn the car around.

118
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
Say it from the forest.

119
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
The president.

120
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,780
There's no need to turn it around.

121
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
Why is that?

122
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,780
I can't go home.

123
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Why are you sitting here, Duncan?

124
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Hurry up.

125
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,780
If you have time to smoke, turn the car.

126
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,780
Turn the car.

127
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
I told you to turn the car.

128
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,780
Well, it's been 10 minutes.

129
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,780
I gave him a little.

130
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,780
I'm a fool.

131
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,780
I'm probably hungry.

132
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,780
I heard that the person who was the one who made this challenge was the one who was in the support VTR of the actor Yukari Endo.

133
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
That's great.

134
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Let's take a look.

135
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,780
A message of soul sent to Endo.

136
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Hello, I'm Kuriru Matsumura.

137
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,780
The first person to imitate Takeshi, Kunishiro Matsumura.

138
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,780
He has the skill to make Takeshi-san's heart beat fast, but he sends Eiru to Endo who is aiming for the world's best.

139
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,780
I also heard the voice of Takeshi-san who has been doing this for 20 minutes.

140
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm getting tired.

141
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,780
I don't think the lord can imitate me this much.

142
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,780
He imitates me so much.

143
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Endo, I'm happy too!

144
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,780
If I can do this for an hour, I'll be a real comedian!

145
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
The next message is...

146
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Hello, I'm Nishioka.

147
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:45,780
The former housekeeper, Nishioka, has a big deal with a famous actor who used to live in the same apartment.

148
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,780
He sends Eil to Endo.

149
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,780
I moved last year.

150
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Chiaki and Endo said they would buy the room.

151
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Chiaki was very motivated.

152
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:05,780
But, it's been less than a month since we last saw each other.

153
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,780
I hope you'll aim for the world record and show us your best.

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,780
I hope you'll let us see you play in the Chia Cup again.

155
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,780
Tokuma-san also did a VTR.

156
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,780
He's still doing it in the middle of the VTR.

157
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,780
It's getting dark.

158
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,780
It's a story that you and Kiraiyu are also like that.

159
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,780
It's a story that Kiraiyu will be able to live with the money he makes.

160
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
The car hasn't started yet.

161
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,780
It's not going to start yet.

162
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,780
It's going to start soon.

163
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,780
The wax of the park is coming out.

164
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
It's from Mr. Yumeida of Piccadilly.

165
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
It's true.

166
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,780
I'll tell you that I love you.

167
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
I'm grateful.

168
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,780
Stop playing the guitar!

169
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
I wonder if this is reaching Endo.

170
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Endo can't see this.

171
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
That's right.

172
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
Hurry up and turn it, Daka!

173
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
What are you doing?

174
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
Turn it!

175
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
You're so angry!

176
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Turn the car!

177
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
I'm waiting.

178
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Turn the car!

179
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,780
Turn the car!

180
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
Daka!

181
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
There's nothing here.

182
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,780
What?

183
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
The car is already running.

184
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Hurry up and do it.

185
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
I see.

186
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Hurry up.

187
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
What happened to the coffee?

188
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Idiot.

189
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
What are you drinking?

190
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
I can't drink it.

191
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
I can't drink it.

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Hurry up and do it.

193
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Turn right.

194
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
It's already running.

195
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm sleeping.

196
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Why don't you sleep?

197
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
Go to sleep, you bastard!

198
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Go to sleep!

199
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Hurry up and go to the pub!

200
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
You always sleep in pubs.

201
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Shut up and go to sleep!

202
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Don't get up, I'm sleeping!

203
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Stop!

204
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Hey, you bastard!

205
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,680
You should have stopped the car here.

206
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
Open it.

207
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Open it, Duncan.

208
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
Open it first.

209
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,380
Stop it.

210
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm filming.

211
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
You bastard.

212
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Shut up.

213
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Shut up.

214
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,580
Duncan, stop the car.

215
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,480
Why can't you stop the car?

216
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

217
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
You bastard.

218
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Go to sleep.

219
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Go to sleep.

220
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
What are you doing?

221
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Okay.

222
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Now, we have a letter from Endo's mother.

223
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Kiyo-san.

224
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Let's read it.

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
To Sho-chan.

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
How are you?

227
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,680
It seems that you can't come back to Osaka recently.

228
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I'm looking forward to seeing you on TV every day.

229
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Sho-chan has grown up to be a great adult.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
When he was a child, he was a child who drank his father.

231
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Once he sucked out his father, he was not far from his father.

232
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Sho-chan grew up by drinking his father.

233
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,680
His mother was healed by raising his father.

234
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
And this time, he challenged Takeshi's impersonation.

235
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Congratulations.

236
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Congratulations.

237
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,680
I never thought I would be able to be with you for this long.

238
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Don't give up until the end. Keep it up, Kiyomi.

239
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,680
My father was a very good student.

240
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,680
He still likes to be with me.

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
You know that?

242
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Yeah right now.

243
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I've told you before.

244
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Why did you bring it?

245
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
What is this?

246
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Bring the menu!

247
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Oh really?

248
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
That's the menu of Duncan.

249
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
It's in the restaurant.

250
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
It's in the restaurant.

251
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
It's written there.

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
You should bring the menu!

253
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
I can't bring the menu.

254
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
You're just drinking alcohol!

255
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Don't you have anything else to drink?

256
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Come here you bastard.

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Come on, Mimata.

258
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Mimata, you're always like this.

259
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Mimata, you're always like this.

260
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Hurry up and bring the menu!

261
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
You bring the menu, I don't know what to do!

262
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
The restaurant staff will bring the menu!

263
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,680
You're kidding me, right?

264
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,680
Now, let's sing a song for Yama-chan.

265
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,680
I can become stronger only by the number of tears.

266
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,680
The flower that blooms on the asphalt.

267
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,680
I'm not afraid of anything.

268
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Tomorrow I'll come for you

269
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Hurry up!

270
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
That's enough!

271
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Turn the car!

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Turn the car!

273
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
We're going home.

274
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
This shop is enough!

275
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Turn the car!

276
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
We're going home.

277
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Turn the car!

278
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,680
His voice is like that of a normal Edo.

279
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Totally.

280
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Now, Tanaka is writing a letter to Edo.

281
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm also writing a letter to my partner for the first time.

282
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm worried about writing a letter.

283
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Excuse me.

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
To Endo.

285
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I think that Endo will be able to do something as a partner for this challenge.

286
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I will read a letter of encouragement.

287
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
You have been surprised since childhood.

288
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,680
When I was in middle school, my parents found out about the ero books that I had hidden in my house.

289
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Most of them were about Go-Rou, Skorra, and so on.

290
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,680
But the book you used was called Jiko.

291
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,680
In high school, you were good at baseball, and you were called from 7 high schools in Japan.

292
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,680
All high schools except the one you chose were selected to be the head of the school board.

293
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,680
You have achieved this unrivaled achievement, and I am surprised again.

294
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
From Naoki Tanaka.

295
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I see.

296
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,680
There are many different feelings.

297
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,680
I can't think of the ending.

298
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,680
I thought I would sing while thinking of what I was doing to Shiranosu-san.

299
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,680
I thought it was very sacred.

300
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
The level is high.

301
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
That's why it's a challenge that can be done.

302
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Put the song in.

303
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Why are you singing Medley?

304
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Where is it?

305
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Come on.

306
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
You should sing with Duncan.

307
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
You're a piece of shit, you bastard.

308
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
What the hell is this?

309
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm going to kill you.

310
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
I'm going to kill you.

311
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
It's a sport.

312
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
We're going to do sports together.

313
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
That's it.

314
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
10 seconds left.

315
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Hang in there.

316
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
It hurts.

317
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
It's okay.

318
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
You're doing great.

319
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm still working on it.

320
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
I see.

321
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
You're doing well in the first few episodes.

322
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
I'm still working on it.

323
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
You're saying something.

324
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
We have more people who are still dreaming.

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Please support us.

326
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,680
A message of soul to ENDO.

327
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Hello.

328
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,680
The CEO of Office Kitano, Mori Masayuki.

329
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,680
He is the representative of the company and also the producer of the movie, Ratsuan.

330
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,680
What is the message he wants to send to Endo?

331
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,680
This time, Endo Kokoriko will be doing a long time recording of Takesu's impersonations.

332
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I hope you can challenge this.

333
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,680
And, by the way, the movie that is currently being shown is...

334
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
It's a pre-release!

335
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Akiresu Tokamen.

336
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,680
This is a high-quality film. It's well-received and highly-appreciated by critics.

337
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I hope you won't miss it.

338
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Please watch Akiris and Kame.

339
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
I hope you will watch it.

340
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,680
I will be happy if you will promote the film.

341
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,680
We are still working on it.

342
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I see.

343
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
It's a great film.

344
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
It's a great film.

345
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
That's amazing.

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
What the hell are you?

347
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Who are you?

348
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
This is bad.

349
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Standing is boring.

350
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Let's read more books.

351
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Let's read more books.

352
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
It's almost 5 o'clock.

353
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
We'll be heading to the spa.

354
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,680
There's a lot of stuff coming in, you idiot.

355
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Do you understand, you idiot?

356
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
It's about time for the third one.

357
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
That's right.

358
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
The last 5 minutes!

359
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Here it comes!

360
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Go for it!

361
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Go, go!

362
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
The last 5 minutes!

363
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Will he be able to do it?

364
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Let's go, Minato!

365
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Go for it!

366
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
You're saying you're going to the spa.

367
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
You should start the car.

368
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,680
You should start the car first.

369
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
It is the last 5 minutes

370
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,960
Why is Mushiwa here already

371
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,800
There are some audience groups who support kind foods

372
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
How complicated

373
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I've never heard of it.

374
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
It's being supported.

375
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Now, just a little bit more.

376
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Now, to sell the last strength and do our best, let's sing another song!

377
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I'm a little confused

378
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I can say it, please say it

379
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Don't lose, just a little more

380
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Run through to the end

381
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
No matter how far apart we are

382
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Our hearts are always by each other's side

383
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm going to chase a distant dream

384
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I won't lose, look over there

385
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
The town I can go back to is nearby

386
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,800
No matter how far apart we are

387
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,800
My heart is by your side

388
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm still looking at the same person

389
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Ah! I'm already dead!

390
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Hang on! Hang on!

391
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Time's up!

392
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Hang on!

393
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Hang on! Hang on!

394
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm almost done!

395
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I wonder if I'll make it...

396
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
What are you even looking at?

397
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm done!

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm done!

399
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm done!

400
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Just a little more!

401
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Ah, I'm going to die!

402
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm going to die!

403
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Endo! Endo!

404
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
That's enough!

405
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
It's about time!

406
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I'm not talking anymore!

407
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Endo! Endo!

408
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
What is this?

409
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Why are you trying to get into trouble?

410
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Let's get out of here!

411
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Endo! Endo!

412
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Wait! Wait!

413
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm going to get in trouble!

414
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
What the hell is this, you bastard!

415
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Why do you work out so hard, you bastard!

416
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Duncan, you! Look at this, study!

417
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Why do you say you love Chiaki, you bastard!

418
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
It's not related, you bastard!

419
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Who are you?

420
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Don't look at me!

421
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Let's count down from 10 seconds ago.

422
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
What the hell is this!

423
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
15 seconds.

424
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
If you can't do it well, then eat it!

425
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
10!

426
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
9!

427
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
8!

428
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
7!

429
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
6!

430
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
5!

431
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
6!

432
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
3, 2, 1, go!

433
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Oh, he did it!

434
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
He did it!

435
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Endo Mageshi, the world's greatest!

436
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Endo, endo!

437
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
He did it!

438
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
He finally did it!

439
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
He finally did it!

440
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Thank you.

441
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
This is amazing.

442
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
He did it, he did it! He did it for an hour!

443
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Thank you.

444
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
What?

445
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
What?

446
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Thank you, you bastard.

447
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I really did it in one hour.

448
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
You really did it in one hour.

449
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I did it. I did it.

450
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
I didn't cheat at all.

451
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I did it.

452
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
I thought I might quit halfway through, but I did it several times.

453
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Duncan never turns the car around.

454
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
That's what it is.

455
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
He doesn't even bring the menu.

456
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,800
I thought that the shop staff should bring it.

457
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
It was a complicated private room.

458
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I'll put the one that is not edited in the DVD.

459
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
And I'll give it to Endo.

460
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,800
I'll leave it on the road for the viewers who want it.

461
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
That's right.

462
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Thank you for your cooperation with the people involved in the Otsutsuta incident.

463
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Gakugou Sky News

464
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
The final game of the punishment game that was discussed by all 5 people.

465
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Including the unreleased broadcast, it is recorded for about 4 hours and a half.

466
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
On November 26th, it will be released.

467
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Yamasaki, who has been defeated in the previous battle, challenges the enemy Moriman.

468
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,800
We are now seeing something really strong!

469
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,340
Will Nishinomiya be able to gain glory by

470
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:09,340
Thank you for watching!
