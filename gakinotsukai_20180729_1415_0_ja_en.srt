1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time, let's play the original game of the Genshin Impact!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's amazing that you can still be so strong while sitting on this chair.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You don't have to use your abs.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Stop messing around with the Donami.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't want to get in the way of the game.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are we doing today?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What are we doing?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't eat my chin!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are we doing?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is that, right?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
When I was being made a castle by Kun-chan

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We all played a game together

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The future-lover Cookie who was broadcasted in May has come

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Actually, he is behind Hamada's make-up

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to start playing some simple games now.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please look forward to it.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Isn't that hell?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hell? It's okay.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He made him play a game that was hard to understand.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But Hamada-san, that was cut out.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, really?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're saying we should play that game that was cut out?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So you did it because you knew it?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There are many games like that in the world of Tomaoka and Yoshi.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a second half, isn't it?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a game that was first halfed.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I played board games a while ago.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's fun.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But it's a game that comedians first halfed, so I can't lose to that.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's so funny.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm thinking about something really interesting.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm in the back!

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm in the back!

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm in the back!

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It was a cover!

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It was a cover!

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm looking forward to today's show.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's do it together.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The first one, please.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The first one is...

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The first one is...

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh!

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please come here.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please come here.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is a very interesting game that we thought of.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't say it!

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You haven't explained it yet!

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Chocolate Planet.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What is the original game they thought of?

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Original!

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The game we brought is this!

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a scary game.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was given a role of Motoya Izumi.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In that role, I walk slowly and slowly with a strong voice.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a funny joke.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I used that as a game.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a game that returns the subject to the original meaning.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
For example, if the subject is a banana, it's a little bit sly.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's like this.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If it's frozen, it's cold.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's cold.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You put it on a rhythm and then you return it.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The rhythm is...

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So-lori, so-lori, pon-pon, banana, zuru-ri, zuru-ri, pon-pon, kouri.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You connect it like this.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you understand?

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is it okay?

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, if you put a rhythm in...

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not confident right now.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But it was really fun, right?

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Uuuhhh!

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dondaga!

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is this?

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, no.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The game quality is too high.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not even close.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm really happy.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The game is called Kyogen Sorori Sorori Game.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You have to connect the words with the rhythm of the word.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you can't say the same word, you will be out.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will start.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will start.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,840
and I'm going to start a saying game

88
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,460

OK celebrate

96
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,720
I can't become a woman

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
You have to repeat it once.

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
That's right.

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
If it's Melody, then say it.

100
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I can't do Melody.

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
If you say Melody, then it's Melody.

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Please answer once.

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Slowly.

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
You're doing it slowly.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
We're professionals.

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
You're too focused on that part.

107
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
I understand.

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
I'll start again.

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Let's start with a different topic.

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
You'll say it with a different one.

111
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I'll do it slowly.

112
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Slowly.

113
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720

124
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
What's with that?

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
What does that mean?

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Ne-me-ri?

127
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Ne-me-ri and...

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
If it's Ne-me-ri, then I don't get it.

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Ne-me-ri.

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I've never heard of it.

131
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Even if it's Ne-me-ri, it's in the director's head.

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
I've never heard of it.

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
It's Ne-me-ri, right?

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm sorry, but it's not turning at all.

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
I want you to do it!

136
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
It's a rule now!

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll go first

138
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
I'll go first

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
I'll go first

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Please say the next word

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720

What are you doing?

148
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Just a little bit.

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
What are you talking about?

150
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Oh, that's right.

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
You're talking about slurries.

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
It's okay if there's no pompon.

153
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Say it again.

154
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
There's a lot of pompon.

155
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
There's a lot of pompon.

156
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
It's better to have pompon.

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
No, no, no.

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
It's better to have pompon.

159
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I want pompon.

160
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I want pompon.

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I'll put in pompon.

162
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
I understand.

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I'll do it with Pon Pon.

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
I think it'll be a little difficult.

165
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I'll do it.

177
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
No good.

178
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Gorori is a very difficult word.

179
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
It's amazing.

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,720
You're not even a bit old!

181
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
You're not even a bit old!

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I feel sorry for the ChocoPla!

183
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm sorry!

184
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,720
I didn't think it would last this long!

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Even YouTubers are prettier!

186
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Even YouTubers are prettier!

187
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Even though you're adding the sound effects!

188
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
You're spending time thinking!

189
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
I'll just do it normally from now on.

206
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Hey!

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Hey!

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,720
What are you doing?

210
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
You are the same!

211
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
You are the same!

212
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
What are you doing?

213
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm sorry! I'm worried about this!

214
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm sorry!

215
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I'm sorry!

216
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
And the water came out!

217
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
I told you!

218
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
It's useless!

219
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
I can do it!

220
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I can do it!

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Pon pon! Kimono!

222
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Pon pon!

223
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Softly! Softly!

224
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Pon pon! Ramen!

225
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Pon pon! Slyly! Slyly!

226
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Prickly, Pon Pon

227
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720

228
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Sit, Sit, Pon Pon

229
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Three times, Pon Pon

230
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Refreshing, Refreshing

231
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Pon Pon

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
La, Pa

233
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Pon Pon

234
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Prickly

235
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
No, no, no, no

236
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
No, no, no

237
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Even if you wear it, you'll be dragged by my three times

238
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Three times

239
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
But he said something good

240
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
But he said something good

241
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
That's true

242
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,720
If I say more, he will pull my ramen into my udon

243
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
The world view of money

244
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
But he said something good

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
But it's interesting

246
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
It's not just a match, it can be done by two people

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
It can be done by many people

248
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
What if it's two people?

249
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Can you do a little downtown?

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Downtown?

251
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
I can't lose to this

252
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,720
But don't get influenced by me

253
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Don't take my world view

254
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
It's a completely different approach

255
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Who should go first?

256
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
You go first

257
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
You two go first

258
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
You

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
You go first

260
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Oh, well, okay

261
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I'll go first

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720

Nukeri

281
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
That's too bad

282
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm safe!

283
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
You're safe!

284
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
You're a grown-up now!

285
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
You're a grown-up now!

286
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
You're a grown-up now!

287
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm a cute kid!

288
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm a grown-up now!

289
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Please welcome the next comedian!

290
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Hello!

291
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Hello! Thank you!

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Thank you!

293
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Shimofuri Myoujo!

294
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,720
The original game tour that they co-authored!

295
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,720
It's like a human bingo, but I want to test your intuition and luck today.

296
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I will explain it.

297
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Seiya's word derby.

298
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,720
I will sing a song that I will sing in a loud voice.

299
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,720
You guys write a word that I will say.

300
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
It's a game of luck.

301
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
It's difficult if there are too many words.

302
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
For example, if the theme is animals,

303
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,320
If you draw an animal, and I say,

304
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,120
I got it!

305
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
The person who got it will immediately reject it.

306
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,920
That's the point.

307
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,520
Yes, it's a quick win.

308
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,520
If I get it, I'll break it big time.

309
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Break it big time?

310
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,320
I'll do something amazing.

311
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
I can't clear it without luck.

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920
That's what it is.

313
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
I can't let someone who doesn't break it break it.

314
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:12,320
5 people entered the answer without being seen by Seiya

315
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,320
The genre of singing is animal, here are the 5 people's predictions

316
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Will it be the correct answer?

317
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Seiya-san, please

318
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Then, you can't go back to the answer

319
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Asaka-san, you!

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
You're the one who said it first!

321
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Seiya's word-play derby!

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
There is only one winner!

323
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Animal!

324
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Start!

325
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Looking up, it's a condor

326
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
It has nothing to do with me

327
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
To the right, it's a horse, to the left, it's a rabbit

328
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Letting go, it's a horse and a donkey

329
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Al-majiro, Al-majiro

330
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Your attitude is so Al-majiro

331
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Jackal, you're a jackal

332
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Neeee! Neeee! Neeee!

333
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,320
The three-syllable-nose is watching! The three-syllable-nose is watching!

334
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Nakamura Tamao's big picture.

335
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Rabbit! Bonus time!

336
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Dog, turtle, dog, lion, cheetah!

337
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
It's here!

338
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
It's here!

339
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
It's here!

340
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
It's here!

341
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
It's here!

342
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Amazing!

343
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
How was it?

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
I don't feel like I've done it.

345
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I don't feel like I've done it.

346
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
It's amazing.

347
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
It feels good to say yes.

348
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Matsumoto-san, what did you say?

349
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
The beaver didn't appear.

350
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
The beaver didn't appear?

351
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
It's quite rare that it's shown

352
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Like the Narmajiro

353
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Jackal

354
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Yama-chan and I have a giraffe

355
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
It's not shown

356
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
It's not shown as expected

357
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
This one is likely to be shown too

358
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
It's an elephant

359
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
An elephant won't be shown

360
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
It won't be shown

361
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
It's really likely to be shown

362
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Next is the second round

363
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
The topic is the job that children admire

364
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Here are the 5 people's predictions

365
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,320
I really want you to get it right. I want you to make the best one today.

366
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Here we go!

367
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
The second round of the Seiya's Tango Derby!

368
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
The food that children long for! Start!

369
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Chan chan chan chan chan chan chan

370
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Zousen Gishi

371
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,320
You only talk about the Hanko family, right?

372
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
You always talk about the Hanko family, right?

373
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Electricians don't move like this, right?

374
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Electrician

375
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,040
Lying again.

376
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,020
Was not so cruel.

377
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,120
The guy who Lisa прочagi.

378
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
The guy who procede the balance sheet.

379
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,840
Was not so hard.

380
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,320
The guy who preceding the tension sheet.

381
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,300
Was not so hard.

382
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,220
She patted the wall.

383
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,860
Amazing text.

384
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,020
He should stand his ground.

385
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
I love this game!

386
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
I think this game can be played by Endo.

387
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Oh, I see.

388
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Endo's Derby.

389
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:40,420
Endo's

390
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Let's all ride the Shinkansen together, the ambulance!

391
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Suddenly, the Endo Shouzou's Tango Derby is held.

392
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,420
The topic is, Norimono!

393
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Please.

394
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Are you okay?

395
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
Everyone, are you okay?

396
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Yes, we're okay.

397
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
Did you all get it?

398
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
It's Norimono.

399
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
Norimono, right?

400
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,420
If I tell you what I said, it'll be amazing.

401
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,420
Here we go, Norimono.

402
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Here we go!

403
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
The word of the brain is...

404
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,420
DUMMY!

405
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Oh!

406
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
There is a Shinkansen here!

407
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Let's all get on the ambulance!

408
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,420
Oh! There is a helicopter here!

409
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Why? Why?

410
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Why?

411
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Why?

412
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
What kind of song is this?

413
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
I don't know.

414
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
I don't know.

415
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Amazing!

416
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,420
I don't know who it is, but thank you for letting me see it early.

417
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
Well, it's a little bit of an imagination.

418
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Next, please come on the comedian.

419
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
Hello, we are TENSEGO.

420
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
TENSEGO also has an interesting game.

421
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Yes, it's so much fun that I'm amazed.

422
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
It's so much fun that you're amazed.

423
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,920
It's very simple, so you can play it right away.

424
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,420
I think it's the simplest game out of all the games we've played today.

425
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,420
It's also easy, so anyone can play it.

426
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
You don't need to ask your age or gender?

427
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,920
I forgot my clip.

428
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,420
Ah, sorry.

429
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,420
And you don't even notice your calf is being patted.

430
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
I can't do it!

431
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
I can't do it!

432
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,420
What can you do if you don't have the sense of the club?

433
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Semi-Soup!

434
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,420
This time, the person who waited for the comment will come up with an original game!

435
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
This is what we came up with!

436
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Was it that kind of voice?

437
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Yes!

438
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,420
If you can see it with your hair, it's a successful game!

439
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Oh!

440
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
What does that mean?

441
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
There is a paper napkin in the pub.

442
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,420
You take one of them and put it on your forehead.

443
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Then blow it.

444
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Then the paper napkin will be flipped.

445
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,420
If you can make eye contact with everyone, you succeed.

446
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
It's very simple.

447
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
What is it?

448
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
How did you come up with that?

449
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
When?

450
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
What?

451
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,420
I thought of this at 3PM when I was drinking with a comedian

452
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
This is a game that comedians play when they go to pubs

453
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Who came up with this idea?

454
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Me

455
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
It has nothing to do with me

456
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
You were trying to liven up the atmosphere

457
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
What's wrong with your pocket?

458
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
What?

459
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
What's wrong with your pocket?

460
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,420
I'll liven up the atmosphere when I succeed

461
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
What's wrong with your pocket?

462
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:56,420
I have one. I was thinking of making it more exciting, but Yukio-chan is still thinking about whether to do it or not.

463
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Ah, I see.

464
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,420
I just put it in my pocket.

465
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Well, you'll never know until you try it.

466
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Scary, scary, scary.

467
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
It's a failure. It's a failure.

468
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
It's a failure.

469
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
It's a failure.

470
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,420
The game is called, If you can see with your eyes, you win.

471
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:24,420
If you can see with your eyes, you win.

472
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Let's start the game.

473
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Take a piece of paper napkin.

474
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,420
You have to cover your eyes.

475
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
You have to lift the rice cake up to the top.

476
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,420
You have to lift it up and blow it.

477
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
That's how it works.

478
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,420
The game starts with picking the paper napkin.

479
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
From here...

480
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,420
The one with a strange habit.

481
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,420
I think it's better to have a dry surface.

482
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,420
Everyone is looking at this.

483
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,420
I'll just look at Mr. Matsumoto.

484
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,420
While I'm turning around, I'll look at everyone.

485
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Can I not move?

486
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,420
You can just put your face up like this.

487
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
Can I put my hands up first?

488
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,420
Yes, you can.

489
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Please put your hands up.

490
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Can someone say something?

491
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Ready, start!

492
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:34,860
Find her

493
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,700
You failed

494
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:35,160
Can't you see?

495
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,780
Your eyes響きません

496
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,780
Not bad

497
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,760
This is a new standing

498
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,440
I can't see

499
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,860
As犬

500
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,680
Autograph

501
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:33,000
A h den

502
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,980
This is not good

503
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,080
Your eyes are doing well

504
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,580
Here

505
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Both eyes?

506
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,080
Yes

507
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Even with one eye?

508
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,580
I thought it was the same with one eye

509
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,080
Ready, start!

510
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
It's there

511
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
It was your chance

512
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
You were that slow?

513
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,580
I can't see everyone so fast

514
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,080
I'm doing it

515
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Next, Hamada challenges

516
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
Please cover it up to the top.

517
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
Yes, that's good.

518
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,580
I'm ready.

519
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,580
Is this guy dead?

520
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,580
This guy is dead, right?

521
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
The white one, right?

522
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
It's a failure.

523
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
It's a complete failure.

524
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
It's a complete failure.

525
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
Let's do it again.

526
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
I'll try the other way around.

527
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
This one is better.

528
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,580
I can do it.

529
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
I can do it.

530
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,580
I see.

531
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,580
I see.

532
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
I see.

533
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,580
This way.

534
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
This way.

535
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Ready, start.

536
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580
He's dead.

537
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
I can only see his eyebrows.

538
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
It's so funny.

539
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
Why is it so difficult?

540
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Matsushita shows his example.

541
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Really?

542
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
He's a champion.

543
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
If you can't see it, I won't say it.

544
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
I see.

545
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Let's go. Ready, start.

546
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Wow!

547
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
What a great sound!

548
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,580
What a great sound!

549
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
I didn't hear that.

550
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
What a great sound!

551
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
It was a good sound.

552
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
It's from the World Cup.

553
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
I don't know.

554
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
I didn't hear that.

555
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
It was a good sound.

556
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
I heard it from the town hall.

557
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
You can't do it with Yukio?

558
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I've never done it before

559
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll try it once

560
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
How do you do it with Suigouji?

561
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
I don't know

562
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Shiopara 2018

563
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,580
The bus that is familiar to the series of the kids' use and the series of the kids' use

564
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
This year, it is also going through a hard time

565
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Will the viewers of the comedy that are coming to watch it be able to endure it?

566
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
We are waiting for you!

567
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Get it!

568
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Finally, Ueno will challenge

569
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
I'm going

570
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
Ready, start!

571
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,580
Ah, it went into my mouth

572
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
Oh, did it succeed?

573
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
It didn't work

574
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
It's a success!

575
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
You used too much of your energy

576
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
I can't say that I split the winning searching

577
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
91st South Key game

578
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm so deceiving

579
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,580
And becoming more exciting
