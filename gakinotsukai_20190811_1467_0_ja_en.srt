1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, everyone is using the same pin mic.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Huh?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Matsumoto-san, you're not doing it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Why?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Why?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I don't like it when you're using the same pin mic.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're saying it as it is.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't like it.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're not angry, you're just enjoying it.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But if you can't do it, I can't do it either.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's fine. You can do it.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's...

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't want to talk about it at all.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You don't want to talk about it at all.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, no, no.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's not what I meant.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're late.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Good morning.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
May I?

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What is it?

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'd like you to look at this.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I saw this on Yahoo News or something.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This time, I'm seriously going to challenge a musical.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It says, a musical.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Tom and Jerry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to use the pepper to make it spicy

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey, look at that face of yours

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's do it!

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you for your kindness

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Everyone, please do it for us

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's called Cinderella

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've already decided on the role

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You've already decided on the other one?

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, I've already decided

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The musical we're going to challenge this time is Cinderella

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Cinderella, a girl who is bullied by her mean mother and two step-sisters, goes to the ball with a magical dress and carriage and falls in love with the prince.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And the role that Endo has decided is, as you can see, the main character of the story, Cinderella.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can I read Cinderella immediately?

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry, I'll be back in a moment.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please take care of the Cinderella role.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Good morning.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Good morning.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are you covering up?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you for today.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You should cover up.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's get closer.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you okay?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm fine.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll be a good Cinderella.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why do you have so much confidence?

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a musical so the song is important

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The lyrics for each scene will come out

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The melody is added in the middle of the play.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The lyrics are added in the middle of the play.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is the best part of the musical.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You write the song?

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You write the song?

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We have prepared the stage for the show.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's so small.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I sometimes become a womanizer.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you mean?

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm a man who's been a man for 20 years.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm not a womanizer.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The atmosphere is coming out.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If I do this, I'll be in the scene.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Especially when I'm a womanizer.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This part is a little feminine.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, that's right.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm really bad at singing.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I'm not confident in singing.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I heard that you're not confident in singing.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ah, I see. I'm not confident in singing.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Do you have any advice for me?

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't do it at this time.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's like an old-fashioned play.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's like this.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not a bad role.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not a bad role.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you feel bad?

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So fast!

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's dirty!

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The unceasing, fast-paced musical, Cinderella, is finally starting!

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
However, after his mother died, his father remarried his new mother, who had two daughters.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But his father also died.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
His mother and two sisters started to do all the housework for Cinderella.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why did my father die?

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
My father...

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He didn't die until he did that.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, Cinderella.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes?

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What are you doing?

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was remembering my father's death and crying.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Did you clean up properly?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Not yet.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you doing? Hurry up.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hurry up and do it.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Mother, it's so dirty.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, it's also covered with dust.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You haven't cleaned it properly, have you?

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hurry up!

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please leave it there.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The place you sleep is the back of the roof

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is tough

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now that Papa is dead, you have no one to rely on

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What a coward! Clean up and do the laundry

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you don't give up, you can't get anything.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's a bad singer.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I won't forgive you. You don't have time to rest.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You should get back to work.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's have lunch.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, mother.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He's so cute.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why do I have to go through this?

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My voice is so bad if you don't mark your chest here

129
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,880
Monde kara

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Three...

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Three...

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Three...

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Three...

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Three days...

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,880
I've been getting scolded

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Tomorrow will be a happy day

137
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
A hard day for Cinderella

138
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,880
One day, an invitation letter arrives at her house

139
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I hereby announce to all the girls in the country,

140
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Tonight, at the castle, the prince's...

141
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
What the hell...

142
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,880
The prince's...

143
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
What?

144
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:31,880
To participate in the martial arts festival.

145
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
I see.

146
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
That's good.

147
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Girls!

148
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Did you hear?

149
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
They're here.

150
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
What's this?

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,380
I'm invited to the Prince's ball.

152
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
It's a ball.

153
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
It's like a dream, mother.

154
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,380
Can I see the Prince again?

155
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,880
Of course.

156
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm so happy.

157
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
It's mine.

158
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
It's mine.

159
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
No, it's mine.

160
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
What?

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,880
My daughters...

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,880
I'll give you a hand...

163
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,880
I'll never get another chance like this

164
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I roll my hair, and put it on my lips

165
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm so thirsty, I have to be liked by the prince

166
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm going to make the prince my prisoner

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I'm going to make the prince my prisoner

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I wink and I kiss and I make you feel mellow

169
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Now, my cute daughters

170
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Let's go to the castle

171
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:28,880
My mother and sisters went to the castle, saying goodbye to Cinderella.

172
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm a magician

173
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm a magician

174
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Hey, wait a minute

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:50,880
When will I be able to experience happiness?

176
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
The next day

177
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I want to go to the castle too

178
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
It's a candy song

179
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,880
I want to dance, but I'm the only one

180
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
What a pitiful Cinderella.

181
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,880
In front of the crying Cinderella, a magician appeared.

182
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Cinderella?

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Yes.

184
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
What are you sad about?

185
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I am left behind.

186
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Poor Cinderella.

187
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Do you know who I am?

188
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Yes.

189
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,880
You came from the land of magic.

190
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,880
You are not an old lady?

191
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,880
That's right! I am a magician who appeared here to make you happy!

192
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I am a magician

193
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:25,240
playback

194
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,740
I will turn this pumpkin into something wonderful with magic

195
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
You can do that?

196
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
I can do it!

197
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:44,740
I am a magician, let's grant your wish

198
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Look, on the pumpkin carriage

199
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Doobie-doo!

200
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Look, a beautiful dress

201
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,740
And the last one is a pair of glass shoes

202
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
Doobie-doo!

203
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
My wish is...

204
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Oh, I wrote Kanagai

205
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,740
It will come true

206
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Doobie-doo!

207
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Now, Cinderella

208
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Cinderella?

209
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,740
C-in-der-la-la

210
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,740
This is not a place I want you to use

211
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Please don't use it

212
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
C-in-der-la-la

213
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Hurry up and change your clothes and save me

214
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Thank you

215
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Cinderella, you are beautiful

216
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Thank you

217
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Grandma, with your magic, I became this beautiful

218
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,740
That's right, and then get on the carriage and head to the martial arts festival

219
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Just promise me, Cinderella

220
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Come back by 12

221
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Otherwise, the magic will only work until then

222
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Yes!

223
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,740
The magical period is until midnight.

224
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,740
You must return before the bell rings.

225
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,740
The carriage started to run towards the castle.

226
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,740
The end is nigh!

227
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
The End

228
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
The End

229
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
The End

230
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
The End

231
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
The End

232
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
The End

233
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Today, I want to find the destination.

234
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:38,240
It's a

235
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,740
It's a

236
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,740
How old are you?

237
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
Is he the king of Thailand?

238
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Prince, she is my daughter. Nice to meet you.

239
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Juliette, 17 years old.

240
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Nice to meet you. Rebecca, 14 years old.

241
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
14 years old?

242
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Prince, would you dance the high-altitude dance with me?

243
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
The high-altitude dance?

244
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Let's dance.

245
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Hell. Hell, hell. This is hell.

246
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,740
How wonderful! The steps are different.

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Is it okay?

248
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
How old are you?

249
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
You're big.

250
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
I'm 14 years old.

251
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
That's so wonderful!

252
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
That's a wonderful step.

253
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,740
The sisters are desperate to please the prince.

254
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
And so...

255
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:25,740
The prince was captivated by the beauty of Cinderella and stared at her.

256
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,740
The two of them took each other's hands and started dancing.

257
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Can you dance?

258
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,240
Yes

259
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Oh, what a beautiful girl

260
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,740
My eyes are on you

261
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Your eyes are so cute

262
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,040
Please cheer for me!

263
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Ah, what a wonderful prince

264
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,740
This is love

265
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Our...

266
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,160
Our...

267
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,560
Encounters...

268
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,280
Encounters...

269
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:43,280
and the miracle of a dream...

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,520
...was a dream 자�.

271
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:07,520
The dreamlike time passed in a flash. The clock's hands rang at midnight.

272
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Before the magic was broken, the new gorilla had to leave.

273
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,520
The girl of the thousand-year-old world...

274
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
The best comedy show is waiting for you!

275
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Looks like the prince is looking for a daughter

276
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I'm sure I'm going to marry the prince

277
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
That was not what I expected

278
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,520
When you were dancing, you stepped on the prince's foot

279
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
And you stepped on his foot

280
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm going to marry the prince

281
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
What?

282
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I'm not going to marry the prince

283
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
You stepped on the prince's foot

284
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
No

285
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I saw it

286
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
You're the one who said that

287
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
What did you do?

288
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,520
You stepped on the prince's foot

289
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Mother, you're being mean

290
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Stop it Rebecca, I'm the one who will be chosen

291
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Why are you saying the same thing?

292
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Juliet, stop it too

293
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Please come in.

294
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,520
And then, the prince finally came to Cinderella's house.

295
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Yo!

296
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Thank you for last night.

297
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
You're welcome.

298
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,520
But I came here to look for a girl.

299
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Yes, I know.

300
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,520
That girl fits perfectly with these shoes.

301
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
You're sleeping alone.

302
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Then, can you sit here for a moment?

303
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
No.

304
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,520
If this fits your shoes, I'll look for a suitable one.

305
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
It fits you perfectly!

306
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
It really does!

307
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm glad!

308
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
There's still some left.

309
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
There's still some left.

310
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
It means it's not you!

311
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Hey! Move!

312
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Hey you!

313
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Then you should try it on.

315
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Excuse me.

316
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
It fits you perfectly.

317
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
It fits you perfectly, mother!

318
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Isn't it a little tight?

319
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
No, it fits you perfectly.

320
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I'm glad, Your Majesty.

321
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
It's Haru.

322
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,520
I don't think the girl yesterday was that big.

323
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
No, it's not you.

324
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
She wasn't that big.

325
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
There's no girl in this house anymore?

326
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Yes.

327
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Prince, can I try on those shoes?

328
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Try on?

329
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,520
I think it's better to try it on and see if it works.

330
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Prince, please.

331
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Please let me try on your shoes.

332
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Please.

333
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Give me a little time.

334
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Please, prince.

335
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,020
Yes

336
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,520
Here you go

337
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Put it down

338
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,020
Yes

339
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,020
The prince put on the glass shoes for Cinderella

340
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,520
Oh! It fits perfectly!

341
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
That means...

342
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
You...

343
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,520
You were the one!

344
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,020
Yes

345
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Olga characteristic

346
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,900
So many daughters

347
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,340
Were unable to steroids

348
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,300
Glass's so acute

349
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,500
Look, is so perfect

350
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,780
I have finally shown you

351
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,900
Someone important

352
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Please marry me!

353
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,900
I believed it!

354
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
This day will come for sure!

355
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Finally, I found the right person for me!

356
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Wow!

357
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,900
Cinderella married the prince and lived happily in the castle.

358
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
It was really really good!

359
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
It was really really good!

360
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Everyone is a god!

361
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,900
The prince is a soldier.

362
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
Is he a soldier?

363
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I don't know the country's setting.

364
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Everyone is a woman, so it's a man.

365
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
It's a little low.

366
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
And, I'm going to be on the show.

367
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Tom and Jerry.

368
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
That's a tear..

369
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,260
I'm sorry

370
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Thank you for watching!
