00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
High Tension The Best Game

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
At home, High Tension The Best Game!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
With what you have at home, you can play the ultimate high tension game. High Tension The Best Game!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's no pattern at all!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The selection from 297 candidates!

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The super exciting game of young comedians!

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's move on to the 5th place this week!

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
411 points! My handmade mask, Miki Kosei!

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Congratulations!

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Is this your first time?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, it is. I got 5th place for the first time.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The room is white, so it looks a little dull.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My wife told me not to show anything other than this room.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm really sorry.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What was your job during your self-restraint period?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm doing a new comedy show with my brother Asei on Instagram every day.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is that a PR for Kyoto?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Please stop, Matsumoto-san.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Is that a PR for Kyoto?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Please stop.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The world has forgotten about it.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What is a PR for Kyoto?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I didn't get it.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What is a PR for Kyoto?

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I didn't get it. Please stop.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He got something, didn't he?

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I didn't get it

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will play a part that I have summarized

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please stop it

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You got it from Yoshimoto

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This week's 5th place

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Miki Kosei's My Handmade Mask

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My handmade mask is here

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here it is!

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Isn't it cute?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm wearing my wife's underwear!

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My wife's underwear!

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There's a ribbon here!

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Isn't it cute?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's a match!

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you!

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's here!

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you, wife!

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not laughing!

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not laughing at all!

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm earning money with this!

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not laughing at all!

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look at me!

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you for your wife, Yome.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thanks to Yome's panty mask.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you very much.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will do it with gratitude.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yome.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You finally laughed.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My family is safe and peaceful.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you very much.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thanks to downtown.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was Yome's panty mask.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you very much.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is it a love story?

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I told you not to show your room.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was wearing a pair of pants, but I said ok.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is this?

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is it just me? I don't like this.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You were sleeping in that.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go back to the announcement of the best 10.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The 4th place is...

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
554 points.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tashi-san's favorite, Tom Brown.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
First place.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Congratulations!

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hello!

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I hate this kid!

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Kanoa-san clearly said he hates you.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, everyone has their own likes and dislikes, so it can't be helped.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not a big deal, is it?

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's an apartment.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's an apartment?

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you have a bath?

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
For the past 50 years, I have a bath.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How many rooms?

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's 4.5 million yen.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you earn 3 million yen, you can get a bigger place.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, I didn't get any.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's like a non-fiction.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not enough.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not a non-fiction.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I've seen the movie.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
According to the staff's information, this person has a woman who calls him on a lonely night.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not a good thing.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I love the Philippines pub.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Philippines pub?

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There is a 32-year-old woman named Erica.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you go out with her?

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, I don't go out with her.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I went to the pub and got along with her.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I called her a few times during the quarantine.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He laughs at my jokes.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When I call him and say that my face looks like Tamaki, he laughs.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't have anything yet, but I hope I can do something good.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you talking about?

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm the one who's talking to you.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's been so long.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's go.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This week's 4th place.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Tom Brown's favorite song.

110
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,960
※opposite song

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,760
Hahahaha exceeding...

112
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,140
Hahahahaha

113
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,300
oush!!

114
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,440
THoss ituo

115
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,820
It's to beat

116
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,300
What? What? What!?

117
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,140
Hahahaha

118
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
You sang well.

119
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Wakamatsu is singing.

120
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
What is this?

121
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
It's a soap.

122
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Thank you very much.

123
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Thank you very much!

124
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Thank you very much!

125
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
It was a lot of fun though.

126
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Now, before announcing the 3rd place, let's have a spotlight for this week!

127
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Spotlight

128
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,140
If you have the energy, you can do anything.

129
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:53,140
The 27th place is Nelson's Wada Manju.

130
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Congratulations!

131
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Yes

132
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,140
I thought you were Kinoshita from TKO

133
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,140
No, I'm not

134
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Manju-san, I heard you have a special skill, please show us

135
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Oh, is that okay?

136
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Yes

137
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Manju-san

138
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Yes

139
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
You said you have a special skill

140
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
It's a down jacket

141
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,140
Down jacket, I see

142
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:25,660
From the top, white, red, purple, green, and blue

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,060
If you choose one color, you can remove it without using your hands

144
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,980
I see

145
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,780
Then, the most difficult one is purple

146
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,940
Purple seems to be difficult

147
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,940
I'll go with the purple one.

148
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,940
No, it's the bottom one.

149
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
It's the bottom one.

150
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
What the hell?

151
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Except for the blue one.

152
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
Except for that one.

153
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Anything else is fine.

154
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:16,940
I don't know why I can't accept it. It's the most difficult one.

155
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,940
This week's 27th, Nelson's Wada Manju.

156
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,940
If you have the spirit, you can do anything.

157
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I'll put glasses in the boiling water!

158
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
I'll do it!

159
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
I'll take it!

160
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,940
It's hot!

161
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
I can do it!

162
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,940
I can do it!

163
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,940
It's hot!

164
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Damn it!

165
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,940
I can do it!

166
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
I can do it!

167
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
It's hot!

168
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
I took it!

169
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
Thank you very much!

170
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Thank you very much!

171
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Thank you very much!

172
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Thank you very much!

173
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Manju-san, you don't look that funny even if you do it on your own.

174
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,940
What are you talking about?

175
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Let's have the next spot light artist come on stage.

176
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Please come on out!

177
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:24,940
This week, we have the person who was ranked 19th in the list of the most scary person in the world, Mr. Ijiri Okada!

178
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,940
Please welcome him!

179
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Today, we have a person who has a long career.

180
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Ijiri, where are you coming from?

181
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Ijiri, how long have you been doing this?

182
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
It's been 33 years.

183
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,940
It's not that different from us.

184
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,940
What about you, Izumi? Is your work hard?

185
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Since the end of March, I've lost all my events.

186
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
I see.

187
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:08,920
I had a lot of work in the

188
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I want to do it.

189
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
So, can I do it?

190
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
No, no, no. But this is not a council.

191
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
No, no, no.

192
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Don't do it.

193
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
No.

194
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I don't want to do that.

195
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I don't really want to do that.

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I really don't want to do that.

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I really don't want to do that.

198
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Let's go to the 19th place this week.

199
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Ijiri Okada was too scared to say a word.

200
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Hey! Hey! Look at that face! Hey! Look at that face!

201
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm scared! Answer me!

202
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm scared!

203
00:10:52,340 --> 00:11:03,360

205
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Dangerous, you'll cut your tongue.

206
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Hey!

207
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Hey, which one?

208
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Which one? Which one?

209
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
But it's fine!

210
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Hey!

211
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Bama-ko!

212
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Thank you very much!

213
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Lastly, can you imitate the court?

214
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Sure, I'll do it.

215
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Can I do it?

216
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Yes, you can.

217
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Okay, I got it.

218
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Let's stop it!

219
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
What are you doing?

220
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Let's stop it!

221
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,700
You can touch your wife's nipples from the side.

222
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
It's hell.

223
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I'm sorry, I'll call you back.

224
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Out of 297 applicants, the one who unfortunately missed the best score is...

225
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,700
The comedian who was ranked in the last few places.

226
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,700
The combination of Jyaraihoga, Tom Brown and Nunokawa Hiroki.

227
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
The winner is...

228
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
It's a great balance.

229
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I was a fool!

230
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
I was a fool!

231
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I was a fool!

232
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I was a fool even if I was hit once!

233
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,020

I want to eat more delicious food!

257
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Delicious food! Eat!

258
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
My body is so tired.

259
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Amazing.

260
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
My body is so tired. Good job.

261
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,500
So, let's announce the top 3.

262
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
This week's third place is...

263
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,500
712 points

264
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,500
2020 Hamada Masato Shoujo, Kogoriko Endo Shoujo

265
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Congratulations

266
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
It's a new house, a new house

267
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It's cool

268
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
It's a nice house

269
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
It came down from the stairs

270
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,500
This is your new home, right? It's close to Shinjuku, right?

271
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Yes, it's been a little over a year.

272
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I haven't been there, but you haven't been to Hama-san?

273
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I've only been to the living room once.

274
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
That's right. It was really fun back then. Thank you.

275
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
What are you doing now?

276
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Oh, yes. She's next to me right now.

277
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yes.

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
The wife behind me.

279
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Chiyaki.

280
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
What?

281
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
No, no. I'm Masami.

282
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,500
She's looking at her wife, and while looking at her eyes, she's looking at the wife behind her.

283
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Wait a minute.

284
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Wait a minute.

285
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
What are you doing?

286
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm doing this.

287
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Oh, I see.

288
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, I see.

289
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Today, you are still wearing that kind of clothes!

290
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Stop it!

291
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
You are showing too much!

292
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
You are showing too much!

293
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Stop it! Stop it!

294
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
You are showing too much!

295
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Is it really Mr. Inigiri?

296
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Mr. Inigiri?

297
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I heard that you have something you want to do remotely.

298
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,500
It's remote, so when I appear on TV,

299
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I do an interview with Hamada-san,

300
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
where he is scratching his neck.

301
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Ah!

302
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's a customary pattern.

303
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I think you can do it remotely.

304
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
You can't touch your wife's nipples from the side.

305
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
To my wife?

306
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Yes, just put your hand out and let her touch your nipples.

307
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Masami-chan!

308
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
It's a little bit of a sudden thing.

309
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
It's okay.

310
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Just put your hand out.

311
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Just put your hand out.

312
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Excuse me, madam.

313
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
And then, like I'm doing it, stop it!

314
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I don't want to say stop!

315
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I got it.

316
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Just the hands.

317
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Mr. Endo, how do you feel today?

318
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
You are the third place.

319
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Stay home.

320
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Stay home.

321
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Stop!

322
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I can't stand it.

323
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I can't stand it.

324
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
It's a little confusing.

325
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,500
The mother touched the father's nipple, but the son came to see it.

328
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
It's a hellish sight.

329
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
This week's 3rd place,

330
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,500
In the 2020 Hamada Masato Award for the Kojiko Endo Syozo.

331
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
It has nothing to do with it.

332
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
The bicycle that Mr. Hamada gave me.

333
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,320
The bicycle I got at the New Year's party

334
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:03,180
I've gone through the security check, but I didn't get caught once yet

335
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,120
So, from now on, I'm going to ride this bicycle, ride it, ride it

336
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,840
I'm going to run, after all, I'm going to run

337
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm running

338
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,800
You're not getting on

339
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,400
I can walk on my knees

340
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Alright!

341
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,840
I like that movement

342
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I can read it from your legs

343
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,960
Run

344
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm running

345
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,840
Thank you very much

346
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
Touch your neck again

347
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I wonder if there was a space.

348
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I think it's a little too much.

349
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
How much space is there?

350
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
How is it?

351
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Hell.

352
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Hell.

353
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Hell.

354
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Hey, hey.

355
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
There's a lot of them.

356
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
There's a lot of them.

357
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Hell, hell.

358
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
The children are fighting.

359
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Next, the second place is...

360
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
896 points

361
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,760
He is doing it at home, plus minus, Iwashi Yoshimasa

362
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Congratulations on the second place

363
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Iwashi is the second place

364
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Iwashi-san is the second place after 9 years

365
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I really didn't think I'd rank second.

366
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
What did you think?

367
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I thought I'd be 6th.

368
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
6th?

369
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Thank you for your surprise.

370
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Excuse me.

371
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760

Ah, there's a lot of washing stuff.

381
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,760
If you wash it with the oil,

382
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,760
it won't fall off.

383
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Is it muted?

412
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Isn't it muted?

413
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
It's the worst.

414
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
It's the worst.

415
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
It's the worst.

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Are you alone at home?

Well, I have a daughter, but I also have a son who is 7 years old.

421
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
You are very good at armpit sweat.

422
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,760
I'm worried because you touch your armpit again.

423
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
I can't help it. It comes out.

424
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
It comes out.

425
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
The armpit sweat.

426
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
It's not a smell.

427
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Let's go.

428
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
