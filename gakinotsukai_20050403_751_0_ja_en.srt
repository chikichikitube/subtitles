1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Next time on the Gaki no Tsukai, Chikichiki! No, no, no! Kiss no Uchi! Madonna and the Scented Bus Tour!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's going on?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To be honest, I'm not in the mood for this.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Why?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Because if you think about the past, everyone wears a tuxedo.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What kind of tux did you wear in the past?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You got it right.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If you wear a tuxedo in front of this boy, you'll be made to do a stupid thing.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's nothing to be happy about.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll explain the rules.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Just like last time, we'll play a game in the bus.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The loser will get off the bus.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is the same as before.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
As the title says, Madonna will be waiting for you.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Madonna?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Yes.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
So you want to kiss that person?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Kiss?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Yes.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, you know, it's like a kiss with Madonna.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What are you doing?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
His face is huge!

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
First, we'll go to Tokyo Tower.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Tokyo Tower is good, right?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are a lot of tourists.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But today is a sunny day, so maybe there are no people.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm really worried about Madonna.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't do it.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The first Madonna is here!

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The first Madonna is Kocho Ran Abeko.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The charm point is that all three sizes are 130 cm.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Super body.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the first time I've ever seen a man with a big mouth.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm serious.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Really?

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're just being a wimp.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're just being a wimp.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not a wimp.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't do that on TV.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're so full of yourself.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're so full of yourself.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm tired again.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The first game is...

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The first game is...

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want you to hit me.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll do it.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll do it.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Pin, Pon, Pan

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wow, that's it!

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Only when you say Pan

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then, turn this way

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When you say three times out, it's Madonna and Kiss

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Wow!

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't win this!

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go! Pin-Pon-Pan Game, start!

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:47,880
Okay, inside of thecks it is К и tud colour

58
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,020
You just said it

59
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,340
know something

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,300
what lol

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,220
He speaks試 interview

62
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,920
You should taste

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
You can't lose!

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Hamada-san did it safe but it was a terrible mistake

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
It was dangerous

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Ping!

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Pong!

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Pang!

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Ping!

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Pong!

71
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Pyo!

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm glad I got over that

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
You made a mistake in the second and third rounds

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Let's start with Yamamoto-san

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Wait a second

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
I'll wait for you

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Ping!

78
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Pong!

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Pang!

80
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Pong!

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Ping!

82
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Pong!

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Pang!

84
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Ping!

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
PON! PON! PON! PING! PON!

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Ah, that's wrong!

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
It's wrong!

88
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Matsumoto-san is doing it right.

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Why?

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Why was it at that timing?

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Why?

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
It's wrong!

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
It sounded like Takeshi-san.

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
PON! PON!

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,920
After this, Tanaka made a mistake and Matsumoto, Endo and Tanaka lined up in the first floor

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
No, no, no

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
You have to sing the BING!

98
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Too weak!

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
This is scary!

100
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Let's go!

101
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Bim, bom, bam, bim, bom, bom, bim, bom, bim, bom, bim, bom

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Ahhhh!

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
What the hell!

104
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

105
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm sorry!

106
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I found you!

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Why?

108
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,920
In the rain that is falling, the bus is going to Tokyo Tower

109
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Everyone, please check this out.

110
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Wow!

111
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
He's wearing a dress!

112
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
That's gross!

113
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Wow!

114
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
That's gross!

115
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
He's wearing a dress.

116
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
That's gross!

117
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I don't like this!

118
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Now, Mazumoto will kiss you.

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
There's a situation.

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Oh, there is?

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Please protect it.

122
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,420
Yes, sir.

123
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,920
He screams out loud, and runs towards Abeko.

124
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
And then...

125
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Wow, that's a safe kiss.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,920
They hug each other and kiss so sweetly.

127
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Wow, that feels good.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,920
But I'm not sure if he'll do it or not, but he'll probably do it from the other side.

129
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes.

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
No, I'm really waiting for it.

131
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I'm waiting for it.

132
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Mr. Mazono.

133
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Please.

134
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
No, I'm not doing it.

135
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I'll be watching from here.

136
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
There he is.

137
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
What is that?

138
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
I don't like this.

139
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
What is that?

140
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
It's raining!

141
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
There he is.

142
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Wow!

143
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Wow!

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
The size of his face!

145
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
He's sitting!

146
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
It's long!

147
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
He's so tall!

148
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Abeko is really tall!

149
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Isn't it long?

150
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I can't speak.

151
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
I can't speak.

152
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Abeko!

153
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
You are overreacting.

154
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Wait, wait.

155
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
You are overreacting.

156
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Round 2.

157
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
He is like a chameleon.

158
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
It's hard.

159
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
It's hard.

160
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Abeko!

161
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
It's too long!

162
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
It's too long!

163
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
It's too long!

164
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Too long!

165
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
You're so tired!

166
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Yes, it's too hard to do it.

167
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
It's too hard to do it.

168
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Ouch!

169
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
It's too hard!

170
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
It's swollen.

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
I was surprised.

172
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I was surprised.

173
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
What's wrong with your face?

174
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
He's wearing a mask.

175
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
He's full of shit.

176
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
You're doing something bad.

177
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I can't leave him. I don't know what to do.

178
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I don't know what to do.

179
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm afraid I'm going to collapse.

180
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
The second point.

181
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
The second point.

182
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
It's a good atmosphere.

183
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
It's good.

184
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I go to the holiday and buy things.

185
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Young people are also...

186
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Even if you say that you are a person.

187
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm more than that now.

188
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
What is the name of the woman in the picture?

189
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
It's a big picture.

190
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Here!

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Tsubaki Funako, the main character of the Japanese-style painting.

192
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Her charm point when she was 40 years old was a glossy, fine teeth.

193
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,920
This is the one that is attached to the back of the leaf.

194
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Basically, it's a stick that goes like this behind the leaves.

195
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
This person is a person with a bad stomach.

196
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I have a bad stomach.

197
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
What's this?

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,920
The next game is the Magi Shinji Game!

199
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I have nothing else to do.

200
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
This is bad.

201
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
The three lines of the line drawing,

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Naha Naha,

203
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Maggie, Shinji, and the person in the middle,

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
became big.

205
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Where should I start?

206
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Miyasako?

207
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
You start with Maggie.

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Yes.

209
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Maggie, Shinji,

210
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
became big.

211
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Maggie, Shinji,

212
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
became big.

213
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Maggie, Shinji,

214
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Maggie, Shinji, you've grown up!

215
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
This is the one!

216
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm getting goosebumps!

217
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
This is bad!

218
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
I'm going to lose!

219
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Everyone, I'm fine!

220
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
No, no!

221
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
My eyes are swimming!

222
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Let's put this up!

223
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Let's put this up!

224
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Tan tan tan tan!

225
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
This is so bad!

226
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,920
The members who want to avoid kissing Madonna. The game is heating up.

227
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Yamasaki who is good at this game, and even Hotohara made a mistake. Everyone except Endo is standing side by side.

228
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,920
After that, Yamasaki and Miyasako made a mistake and finally the two of them reached.

229
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Who is kissing Madonna at the spring break?

230
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Oh no, oh no, oh no

231
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Miyasako-san first

232
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Ok, let's start.

233
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Magi! Shinji! You've grown up!

234
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Ah!

235
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
No!

236
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Even if you get the answer right

237
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Hamanaka, no

238
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Magi! Shinji!

239
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Magi! Shinji!

240
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Nice!

241
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I can see it now

242
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Hamanaka...

243
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Let's go

244
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Magi! Shinji!

245
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
It's gotten bigger!

246
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Magi! Shinji!

247
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,720
It's gotten bigger!

248
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Magi! Shinji!

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
It's gotten bigger!

250
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Magi! Shinji!

251
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
It's gotten bigger!

252
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
The winner is...

253
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Amuro-san!

254
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Yay!

255
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Amuro-san won!

256
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Downtown!

257
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,720
The bus is going to Odai Bay, where Madonna is waiting for her.

258
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Oh, she's here.

259
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Where?

260
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Where is she?

261
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
She's here.

262
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
She's here in real life.

263
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
She's here as if she's watching us.

264
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
What's going on?

265
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
According to the staff, the public is...

266
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll explain the situation.

267
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Hanako-san, please get off the car.

268
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
When you turn around,

269
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Who is it?

270
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
When you do this,

271
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I'll give you a bouquet of flowers.

272
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
From here on, you can't do anything.

273
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
You're talking a lot.

274
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll leave the rest to you.

275
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Thank you.

276
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Chief.

277
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
It's just this.

279
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
It can't be helped.

280
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Then, excuse me.

281
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm going to the big one.

282
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
The big one.

283
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Let's go.

284
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Let's go.

285
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Who's wearing glasses?

286
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Wow, that's...

287
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
It's a question mark.

288
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Who is it?

289
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
I don't know.

290
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I wonder why you don't know.

291
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Who is it?

292
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I don't know.

293
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Then, I'll give this to you.

294
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Here you go.

295
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Thank you.

296
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Thank you.

297
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
You look like a honeycomb.

298
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Honeycomb? No.

299
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Thank you.

300
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Wow, this is amazing.

301
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to do that.

302
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
I can't believe it!

303
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
It's a big deal!

304
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Wow!

305
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
What a big deal!

306
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I can't believe it!

307
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I can't believe it!

308
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Wow!

309
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Wow!

310
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
This is intense!

311
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
This is perfect!

312
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
This is it.

313
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
This is it.

314
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
This is the same as the one in the movie.

315
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
The one in the Russian movie.

316
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Wow, Nagairo.

317
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
This is really good.

318
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
The other one is broken.

319
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
This is broken.

320
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Oh no.

321
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
That one is falling down.

322
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Are you serious?

323
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
It's intense!

324
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
It's over! It's over!

325
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm red!

326
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Bye!

327
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Bye!

328
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Bye!

329
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
He's running away!

330
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
He's running away!

331
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
This is hell!

332
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
This is hell!

333
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Look!

334
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
His mouth is all red!

335
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Scary!

336
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Wow!

337
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
It's a real one!

338
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Wow!

339
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Wow!

340
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
You're good!

341
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Wow!

342
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Wow!

343
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Amazing!

344
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
The photo is totally different.

345
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Right?

346
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Right?

347
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
His face is so pale.

348
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
He's pale.

349
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Wow!

350
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

351
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,720
No, I think I did well.

352
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Absolutely, Matsumoto-san did well.

353
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
No, no, no, no, no.

354
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
It was a pretty good one.

355
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
It was a pretty good one.

356
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
I'm still watching this.

357
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
It's not a step ahead.

358
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Now, there's more than that.

359
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,720
This is the final point.

360
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I can't think of it.

361
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Okay, I'll do my best.

362
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
So, we are going to the Palette Town.

363
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
That's good.

364
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
The last Madonna is waiting for us.

365
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
That's good.

366
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
There is a guide car.

367
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
That's good.

368
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,720
We will go to the next Madonna's scene and have everyone check it out.

369
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
We will announce it here.

370
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Check it out at the scene?

371
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Yes.

372
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
No matter how many times we took pictures, it didn't show.

373
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
It's finally the last Madonna.

374
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
But the third Madonna is in a mysterious veil.

375
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
The next game is...

376
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
The carbonated game!

377
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Yeah!

378
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
It's a clock game.

379
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
It's a simple clock game.

380
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Somehow...

381
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
You have to say the Japanese words that don't have the word, ta and da.

382
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
You are Japanese, right?

383
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Ta and da.

384
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
You can't say ta and da.

385
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Let's start the game.

386
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Let's go.

387
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Start!

388
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Kotohara.

389
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Miyasako.

390
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Ito

391
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Yamasaki

392
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Endo

393
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Ihara

394
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Miyamoto

395
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Yamakawa

396
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Michii

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Inoue

398
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Hurry up!

399
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Kudo

400
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Chihara

401
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Yamano

402
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Miyao

403
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Michi

404
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Wrong!

405
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Wrong

406
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Wrong

407
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
What are you saying?

408
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
I said Michi

409
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,720
After this, the game became more and more intense.

410
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,720
The names of women who don't have children, the names of men with four characters, and the game with three characters.

411
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,720
The five of them made two mistakes.

412
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Finally, everyone was the least.

413
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Everyone was the least.

414
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Really?

415
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Yes.

416
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
It's really decided.

417
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Ah, I'm the worst. I'm the worst.

418
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I can't do it.

419
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Alright!

420
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,720
What kind of kiss will Ai do?

421
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Ready, set...

422
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Domino

423
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Knock

424
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Walnut

425
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Mouse

426
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Mouse

427
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
What?

428
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
This is...

429
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
What?

430
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
What?

431
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
What are you talking about?

432
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
What are you talking about?

433
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
If I say A, you say mouse!

434
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
You should have seen it clearly

435
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Yes! Madonna's

436
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Finally, the bus is waiting for the mysterious Madonna

437
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
To the final point

438
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Everyone, please look

439
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
This is a place I hate

440
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
It's so cold

441
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Oh, that's the one!

442
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Oh, that's the one!

443
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
The girl's clothes!

444
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Oh, it's big.

445
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
It's beautiful, though.

446
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Who?

447
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
It's beautiful, though.

448
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
So, here's Madonna.

449
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
It's big.

450
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
It's big.

451
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
There are so many people.

452
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
So, everyone, look at this crowd of people.

453
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
This is the model.

454
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
First, look at this.

455
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
She's beautiful.

456
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Then, look back.

457
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
She's wearing a wedding dress.

458
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Then, she says,

459
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I love you.

460
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Then,

461
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
she says,

462
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
She's not wearing a wedding dress.

463
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
She's wearing a wedding dress.

464
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Who is that?

465
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
She's a bit of a heroine.

466
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
A heroine at the end?

467
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
It's embarrassing.

468
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
It's like a punishment for being shy.

469
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
That's not good.

470
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
It's hard to do.

471
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
That's good.

472
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
There are many jellies.

473
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
I don't like this.

474
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Madonna is...

475
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
This person.

476
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Madonna.

477
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I don't like this.

478
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Madonna is...

479
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
This person.

480
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Madonna.

481
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Wow!

482
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
It's Mimata!

483
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
It's Mimata!

484
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
It's Mimata!

485
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It's a man!

486
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
It's a woman!

487
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
It's a woman's feelings.

488
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Isn't it bad?

489
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
It's like love.

490
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
If you wait too long, it will go higher.

491
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Yes, yes.

492
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Do your best.

493
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
It's breaking.

494
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
It's a big one.

495
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
It's slow.

496
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Sorry, sorry.

497
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
But it's just right.

498
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Why is it right? It's left.

499
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
It's nervous.

500
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
It's nervous.

501
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I love you.

502
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
10 people

503
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
There he is!

504
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Wow!

505
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
He's coming!

506
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
He's coming!

507
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
He's coming!

508
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
He's coming!

509
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
He's coming!

510
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Ladies and gentlemen.

511
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Hello.

512
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Hello.

513
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Hey.

514
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,720
What's going on these days?

515
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
There's something strange.

516
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Something strange?

517
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
I don't know if you're angry or not.

518
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I see.

519
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I opened the parking lot.

520
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
I was about to go.

521
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,720
A taxi came.

522
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I was about to go.

523
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,720
I was waiting for a light.

524
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,720
The taxi stops in front of you and takes you off the bus.

525
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
What?

526
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,720
It's totally fine whether you're in front or behind.

527
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,720
It's completely self-evident.

528
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
What would you do if you were a normal person?

529
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I would wait.

530
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I mean, I can wait, but I don't know what's going on.

531
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I'm getting angry.

532
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I guess so.

533
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Why am I here? I'm not supposed to be here.

534
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
I'm just a little behind.

535
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,720
The taxi driver apologizes.

536
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm sorry.

537
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
The old lady who came down said,

538
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
I'm sorry.

539
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
That's fine.

540
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
But,

541
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
If you apologize like that,

542
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
What is this feeling?

543
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
It's fine.

544
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
I'm sorry.

545
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Why?

546
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
But it's strange, isn't it?

547
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
What is this feeling?

548
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
The other day, I went to Kiyoshi-cho.

549
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Yes.

550
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
I happened to go there to eat.

551
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
That's right.

552
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,720
I heard that you were going there occasionally.

553
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I didn't know that you were going there.

554
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
But when I came, you came.

555
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
I think you were a little drunk.

556
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
I said, I'm going home soon.

557
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,720
He said, this is your treat.

558
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
He said a light joke.

559
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I couldn't accept it.

560
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
You don't have to say that.

561
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I was wondering what was going on.

562
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I think he was saying,

563
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm looking forward to the matcha.

564
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
That's a good thing.

565
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I wrote it and said to Yamazaki,

566
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I'm looking forward to the matcha.

567
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
I said that.

568
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
And then he looked at you and said,

569
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,620
