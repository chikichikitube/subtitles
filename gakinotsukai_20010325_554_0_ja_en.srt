1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, it's time for Downtown vs. Koko Neko's 100 Spring Games!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, stop it!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm serious!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I won't stop! I'm not wearing that!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're wearing it!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm wearing it!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're wearing it!

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm looking forward to it!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
First, toilet paper, roll, roll, battle!

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're not going to lose, right?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll start from the end.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ah, huh?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is this?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What is this?

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What is this?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Really?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ready...

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:15,640
See the contents of the videoï¿½

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Good morning.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
You're always wearing Betty.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Oh, really?

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,640
That's the way it is.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I've been watching you all the time.

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Good morning.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Shinobara-san, it's been a while.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Yes, it's been a while.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Where are you going?

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,640
I'm going to say goodbye to everyone.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Goodbye?

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,640
I decided to move to San Fran with my family.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
San Fran? Where is San Fran?

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
San Fran.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Where?

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
San Fran.

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
San Francisco.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
San Francisco, San Fran.

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Why?

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Well, there are many reasons.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,640
But Japan is not good.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:21,640
The price of the land is going down, the value of the apartment is going down.

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,640
The secret of the apartment is going up.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
There is no one who doesn't care about it.

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
That's OK.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,640
It's a bit of a vague statement, but I don't like it that much.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
I can't help it.

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
You didn't get it on purpose, did you?

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
No, no, no.

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
It's not enough.

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
We're shooting the opening.

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Yes, we are.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
It's so hot.

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Isn't it hot?

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Today.

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
It's so hot.

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Is it?

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Well,

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
We're here to say hello,

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
so the temperature must be high.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,640
It's hot.

62
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Do you have time?

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,640
The sun is already setting.

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
It's hot.

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Where is Mr. Suga?

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
He's here.

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Thank you.

68
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
I came to say goodbye.

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
What do you think, Mr. Suga?

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Does it suit me?

71
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,640
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm just asking for money.

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Really?

74
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm just asking for money.

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,640
You're saying that just because you don't want to get in the way of our conversation?

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm sorry, but I'm going in.

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Let's do it.

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Let's do it.

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
There are 100 of them.

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
There are 100 of them.

81
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Everyone, be careful.

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
There are only a few of them.

83
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I'll be the first to sit in the back seat.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Sorry.

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Hello.

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Take care.

87
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Take care.

88
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Have a good day.

89
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Let's go.

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Let's go.

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Let's go.

92
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
We're starting from the middle.

93
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
I won.

94
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
No, no, no.

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
I won.

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Really?

97
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Really?

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
No, I won.

99
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
The first one is Dantara.

100
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
It's too late.

101
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Let's do our best next time.

102
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Don't come too close.

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
What is that?

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
I want to say hello to you.

105
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
What is that?

106
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
That is...

107
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
In the TV station in America,

108
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,640
they want to get close to their daughter.

109
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
In the TV station in America?

110
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
They want to get close to their daughter.

111
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
It's like Super Children.

112
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
What is this?

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Land sale?

114
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You're a prostitute?

115
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm a student.

116
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
You're a student since April?

117
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,640
I'm a student.

118
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,640
That's good news.

119
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Land sale is good.

120
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
What's this?

121
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Oh, I see.

122
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,640
You have to pay 225 dollars.

123
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,640
This is because there is a fanfare.

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
No one is celebrating.

125
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm going to buy it.

126
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm a student from April.

127
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Mr. Suga.

128
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm watching the crew.

129
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
I'm going to enter the school.

130
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
You like it, don't you?

131
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I thought you were a director.

132
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
I thought, maybe he's a director.

133
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
What's the word for entering school?

134
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,640
There's something that comes after that.

135
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Entering school...

136
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
The entrance ceremony.

137
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,640
The entrance ceremony is before that.

138
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Right?

139
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
The one before that.

140
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
The continuation of the entrance.

141
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
The continuation of the entrance.

142
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
That's before that too.

143
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Right, Mr. Tsuga?

144
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
The first time I entered school...

145
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
That's that.

146
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,640
I think we should hurry up and go.

147
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Look, it's already that late.

148
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
It's too early.

149
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
It's going to be a big deal.

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
It's a celebration of our entrance.

151
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
It's a celebration.

152
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I want to give this to everyone, the staff, the cast, everyone.

153
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
It's a celebration of our entrance.

154
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Thank you very much.

155
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,640
And the government, too.

156
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I'll leave it to you.

157
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Take care.

158
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Thank you.

159
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Thank you.

160
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Thank you.

161
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Good luck.

162
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
What's wrong?

163
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Is it hot?

164
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Of course it is.

165
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Take it off.

166
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Don't be so shy.

167
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Oh, you...

168
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
What is that? Six months?

169
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
How is it?

170
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Congratulations.

171
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Is that so?

172
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Wait, Erika.

173
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
It's six months' pay.

174
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Is it hot?

175
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Take it off. It's hot.

176
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
I've been saying this all the time.

177
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm a fan of you.

178
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
That's right.

179
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
When you have a baby, you're a big sister.

180
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I see.

181
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Congratulations.

182
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Congratulations.

183
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
I don't have anything to see.

184
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Congratulations.

185
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm so sorry.

186
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
It's okay.

187
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm sorry.

188
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
This is for you.

189
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,640
From the staff and the cast.

190
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Oh, really?

191
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
It's a gift for your birthday.

192
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Thank you.

193
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Thank you.

194
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Thank you.

195
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Thank you.

196
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Thank you.

197
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Thank you.

198
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
You're so big.

199
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,640
We should just check the place first.

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
We might come back.

201
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
That's right. If we check it...

202
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
We'll do it cleanly.

203
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
We'll do it cleanly.

204
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,640
If we don't check it, we'll go back.

205
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
If we do it, we'll come back.

206
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
That's right.

207
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Well, with this...

208
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
We'll go to America.

209
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Ah!

210
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
What?

211
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
What are you saying?

212
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
This is not funny.

213
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
What's wrong?

214
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Excuse me.

215
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
There's still something.

216
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
We've been suspended.

217
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
What?

218
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
This is the worst.

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
What is this?

220
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
What is this?

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
It's a middle-aged man's ring.

222
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
What is this?

223
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
It's a ring.

224
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
It's a ring.

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
What is this?

226
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
I've never seen this before.

227
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
How many rings are there?

228
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
I don't think there were any.

229
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
There weren't any.

230
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
No, no, no.

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
There weren't many middle-aged men's rings.

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I see.

233
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,640
This place is getting in the way.

234
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
This place is a mess.

235
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
It's a prank.

236
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
It's not a prank.

237
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
It's not a prank.

238
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
You're crazy.

239
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
You're making it up.

240
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,640
It's all the same.

241
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
But this is a little clear.

242
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm...

243
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I just wanted to say hello.

244
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
I just wanted to take a picture.

245
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I came here because you guys wanted to take a picture here.

246
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I parked my car here.

247
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
I see.

248
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,640
So, the person who takes a picture here is bad, isn't it?

249
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
No.

250
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Is it bad?

251
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
It's bad or not.

252
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Well...

253
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,640
The score is good.

254
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Anyway, this...

255
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll do something with the money.

256
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
No.

257
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
It's a million yen.

258
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I don't want to.

259
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
This is strange.

260
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I've never heard of it.

261
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I've never heard of it either.

262
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I want to see if you can accept it.

263
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm going to do it until the end.

264
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,640
I can't do it.

265
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
I can't say anything.

266
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm going to talk to you.

267
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
I'm going to come in.

268
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm going to come in.

269
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Really?

270
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
What is this?

271
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Today's prize money

272
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Ah, the prize money

273
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
One of the BTS

274
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
But I'm sorry for the BTS

275
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Then, I'm sorry

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I accidentally brought today's album

277
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Ah, but this is

278
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Sorry, it's our prize money

279
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
I'll pay for this

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I'll take this

281
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
So, thank you

282
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
It's already late.

283
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
It's already late.

284
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
It's a bit like Nagamune.

285
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
It's already too late.

286
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Wait a minute.

287
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Hey.

288
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
What's wrong with you?

289
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Look at the inside of the car.

290
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
What's wrong with you?

291
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
This is a time bomb.

292
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
You're wasting your time.

293
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,640
It's because someone else has set this up!

294
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
What do you mean?

295
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
That's right.

296
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
That's just a misunderstanding.

297
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
It's not your fault!

298
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
As a single person...

299
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
What are you doing?

300
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I won't lose!

301
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
What are you saying?

302
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
As a single person...

303
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
As a single person...

304
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,640
I won't lose!

305
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
What?

306
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
As a single person, I don't want to be a demon!

307
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
How many times have you said that?

308
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I don't want to be the only one to get a bonus.

309
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
You're making a mistake.

310
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
I don't know what to do.

311
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I don't want to be the only one to get a bonus.

312
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Hey!

313
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Hey!

314
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Hey!

315
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Stop!

316
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Stop!

317
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Hey!

318
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Why are you shouting?

319
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Kazumi!

320
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Kazumi!

321
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
No, no, no.

322
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
It's not Kazumi.

323
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
It's not Kazumi.

324
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm sorry.

325
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,640
I was thinking that it would be nice if I could sacrifice myself.

326
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
But I did.

327
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Where?

328
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
In the mountains.

329
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Even if you did, it wouldn't affect us.

330
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
That's fine.

331
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I don't have any regrets.

332
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,640
I just want to overcome this.

333
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,640
You don't want to lose your strength.

334
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,640
But one thing, he had a ticket to San Fran.

335
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,640
That's all he could do, right, Mr. Tsuga?

336
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,640
He was looking forward to the first class meal, right?

337
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
First class meal, first class meal.

338
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,640
You're just a little kid, so you're not going to eat.

339
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
I was just trying to be nice.

340
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
That's right.

341
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,640
But that's a family problem.

342
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
What should we do?

343
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
What should we do?

344
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
What's the problem?

345
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
The flight attendant.

346
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
The flight attendant.

347
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
The flight attendant.

348
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
The flight attendant.

349
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm sorry.

350
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I'm sorry.

351
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
I'm sorry.

352
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
I want to go home.

353
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I don't know what's going on.

354
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
But...

355
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
But...

356
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm sorry.

357
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,640
If I wear this today, will I be able to earn more?

358
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:47,640
No, it's not that you'll earn all the money, I just expressed my feelings.

359
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm sorry.

360
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Can I take a picture of this?

361
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Sorry, we're running out of time.

362
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Excuse me.

363
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
We're going.

364
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Keep your heart.

365
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Yes.

366
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Thank you very much.

367
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Good work.

368
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
It's a pretty good piece of art.

369
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I'm impressed.

370
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
It's about 2 million yen.

371
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Huh?

372
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Hey, hey, hey.

373
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm so angry.

374
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Hey, hey, hey.

375
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

376
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
What are you doing?

377
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I told you to play it louder. Why?

378
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Are you going home?

379
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm definitely going home.

380
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Let's go home.

381
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Somehow...

382
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Don't film!

383
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
This is Hamada's medicine box.

384
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
We-he-ha-ho!

385
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,640
P-Hang Mo-Hang

386
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
I failed

387
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I was saying this earlier

388
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
With who?

389
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
I was just saying Takasu.

390
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
So you're not buying this skirt?

391
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
I'm not buying it.

392
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
That's a bit mean.

393
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm not buying it. Buy it.

394
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Buy it all.

395
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Why do you have to buy it all?

396
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
What are you going to say about me?

397
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Don't say anything.

398
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
When I go home today, I'll fold it in Jaguar's female seat.

399
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I'll leave it there.

400
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
It's better if you play it.

401
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
What?

402
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Go buy it yourself!

403
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,640
I'll say, good work.

404
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,640
I'll say, bread.

405
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
I'll say, warm coffee.

406
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I'll say, tobacco.

407
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
I'll say, I turned it into a super light.

408
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Please don't forget that.

409
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Don't do that.

410
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
That's how it is.

411
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm a little upset.

412
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Recently, when we went out to eat, we were late at night and he came to the bar with a baby.

413
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I cried.

414
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
At that time, I was irritated.

415
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
I said, let's go home.

416
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
When I finally got up and said, let's go home, he said,

417
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Mr. Mizumushi, Mr. Mizumushi, can I hug you?

418
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,640
What a dirty kid you are.

419
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
I don't know because I'm a kid.

420
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
No, it's okay.

421
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
It's okay?

422
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I said it's okay!

423
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I said I won't hug you!

424
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
If you get mad, I'll go like this!

425
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
You were sitting, right?

426
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
You were sitting like this.

427
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
I've never hugged anyone, so I'm scared.

428
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Now, now.

429
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Now, that idiot is going to do that again.

430
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
He's going to do that again, right?

431
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
It's okay!

432
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,640
I hugged her and said,

433
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
I don't need anything, so I thought,

434
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
and then, BAM!

435
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
What are you doing?

436
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I didn't say anything.

437
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I just hugged her because she asked me to.

438
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Why are you taking a picture without checking anything?

439
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I said, can you stop?

440
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Then, she was like,

441
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Hmm...

442
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
She was like,

443
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Mr. Imada is a good person.

444
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,640
You're going to be the worst, right?

445
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
That's right.

446
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
But that's not right! I'm the one who's right!

447
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Well, I was just saying that if you do this, it'll be fine.

448
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
No, no, if you do this, you won't be able to get it right away.

449
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
If I do it right away, what am I doing?

450
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
You can get angry about that!

451
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
What?!

452
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
This is...

453
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,640
I don't know what you're talking about!

454
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
You can say that!

455
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,640
It's hard being a comedian!

456
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
There's that thing, you know,

457
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,640
You can kill someone to protect yourself, right?

458
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
What's that?

459
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Civil defense?

460
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,640
If you kill someone just because they're dangerous,

461
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,640
It's impossible as a comedian!

462
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
If you kill them...

463
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
It's impossible!

464
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
I said it many times, but he was like,

465
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm killing someone.

466
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
But,

467
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
in the end,

468
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
he was like, shut up, you murderer!

469
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
And then, bang!

470
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
You bastard!

471
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
You bastard!

472
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
You bastard!

473
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
No, that's not true.

474
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
That's just,

475
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
that's just a murder.

476
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I think it's better to kill people.

477
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
That's right.

478
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,640
If you kill people in a summer commotion, I will kill you.

479
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,640
I am a shomenjura.

480
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,640
The other day, Mr. Matsumoto's ceremony was held in the Parerumo of Italy and Sicily.

481
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,640
He was able to change his own social skills through the Olympics.

482
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Please tell us the secret to maintain the memory power and the last number of the circle.

483
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Please tell us the last number.

484
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,640
But why do you think the last number is the number?

485
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Ah, I see.

486
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Normally, I think so.

487
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,640
If there are no numbers, I think the last number is the last number.

488
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
But it's a long way to go.

489
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
It's a long way to go.

490
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
There are many things that happen on the way.

491
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
There is something on the way.

492
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
On the way, there is a hot spring mark.

493
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
On the way, there is a hot spring mark.

494
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
It's like a firework.

495
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
What?

496
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
It's like a map.

497
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,640
I want to say that it's that long.

498
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,640
I want to say that.

499
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
It's getting longer.

500
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Well, it's halfway.

501
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
What about the last one?

502
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
The last one.

503
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
The last one.

504
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,640
If you say it in some kind of numbers, it's 7.

505
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Well, that's fine.

506
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
It's some kind of number.

507
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
The first one is 7.

508
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,640
The last one is 7.

509
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
The first one is 7.

510
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,640
2432,5689,9673.

511
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
3?

512
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
24997.

513
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
You think it's the end, right?

514
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I think this is the last one.

515
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
I think it's the last one.

516
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
I think it's the last one.

517
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Think about it.

518
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Do you understand?

519
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Yes, I understand.

520
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Don't say it.

521
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,640
The last one is the number 7.

522
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
But there is one more at the end.

523
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,640
The last one is the question mark.

524
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,640
235697356447?

525
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
This is the last one!

526
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Are you denying all of them? Or are you denying 7?

527
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
No, no, no, no, no, the number of the numbers.

528
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
So you're denying all of them?

529
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
What?

530
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
3.5...

531
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
What?

532
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Or is it 7 at the end of the last part of the sentence?

533
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm sorry, I'll give you a little more time.

534
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,640
It's a question mark, but there's a surprise mark next to it.

535
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,640
That's why it's still weird.

536
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Why is it a surprise mark?

537
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
7?

538
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
That's just your way of saying it!

539
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Sorry!

540
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
You can just use a question mark!

541
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
If you just use a question mark!

542
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Seven?

543
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Seven?

544
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Even that's a question mark!

545
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,640
If you only use a strong word, what happens if you use it?

546
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
No, if you only use a strong word, it becomes,

547
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Seven?

548
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
That's what happens, right?

549
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
This and

550
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Seven?

551
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
It's not bad.

552
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
It doesn't matter what you do.

553
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Even if it's an entrance exam.

554
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,640
If you're not confident, you can ask for a question mark at the end.

555
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,640
If you're not confident, you can ask for a question mark after your name.

556
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Then, it's impossible to judge.

557
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
But you can't get a re-examination.

558
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
You can't get a re-examination.

559
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Matsumoto Stossi?

560
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I think, did Matsumoto write this?

561
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
You think so, right?

562
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,640
But you can't say it's an illicit.

563
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,740
You can't say that!

564
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,440
You can't say that!

565
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,240
You can't say that!

566
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,940
That means...

567
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,040
You're not passing, right?

568
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,040
I'm not passing, but I'm not not passing.

569
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,840
So I can't go to the entrance ceremony.

570
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,240
You can't say that!

571
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,540
No, no, no! You can't say that!

572
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,640
You can't say that!

573
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,540
I simply can't come to a normal ceremony like this.

574
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,440
No, no, no!

575
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Then, then...

576
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,540
If you're going to do that, you can't say that!

577
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,840
Even the graduation certificate!

578
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,840
I want to get the graduation certificate.

579
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
I can also shoot with a fork like this.
