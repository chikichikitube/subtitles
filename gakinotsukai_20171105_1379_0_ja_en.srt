1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Grand Prix for the Claw Swing!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is a Grand Prix to see how the challenger can do the Claw Swing of a man who knows nothing about it!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But if you think that the video of a man doing the Claw Swing of a man is not worth watching,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If the judge, Downtown, presses the button on his hand, the video will disappear and only the sound will be played.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The person who can do the Chikubi-sui that can be seen on TV without the video being deleted will be the winner

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The first challenger is Kokoriko Endo

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The target is the senpai that Endo is afraid of, Kimura Yuichi

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was always busy when I was a kid

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was busy with my work and my career

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I was doing it to make my child cry

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Endo is starting from the story of Kimura raising his breasts to make his child cry

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You have to go like this

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You have to go like this

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have to go like this

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You have to go like this

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everyone please look here

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You are amazing

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You are the best

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are amazing

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You have already crossed the pass

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You make a sweet noise

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Next is Kokoriko Tanaka

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The target is a fighter, Bobby Oragon

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bobby, you want to fight?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you still want to fight?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're strong

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, you're amazing

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Tanaka wants Bobby to show his muscles

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He challenges him to a neck-water

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll do it with my neck

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're not going to do it?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll do it with my neck

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can do anything

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Bobby, you can do it

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can do it

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you don't talk, I'll lick you.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't want to.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bony.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bony, Chikuya.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you don't talk, I'll lick you.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't know if you can see it, but there are people who can lick you.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I don't think you can see it.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't see anything!

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can't see anything!

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bobby is scared of it

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
After this, Tanaka tries to suck his nipples

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The most important part is the speed

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bobby is so annoyed that he failed to do the neck-swing

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The third one is the first one to use the hug, Miki Kosei

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The target is the senior who is scared of Kosei, Shidori Daigo

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I live in Tokyo, in a hotel for 3 days.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Living in a hotel is really hard.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He is stressed out by his work in Tokyo.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He wants Daigo to suck his nipples.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can rely on you.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why do you want me to be your nipple brother?

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not sure if you understand.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He says it's painful, but it's really hard to come to Tokyo.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You understand, right?

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I've never heard of the walls of Tokyo.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
For now, he wants to show his nipples.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Next to the 5th.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't touch it.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll never touch it.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So don't touch it.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Just don't look.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wow!

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Stop it!

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Wow!

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sorry, I said it out of the blue.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll do it in one go.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
One go.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
His cheeks are going to pop.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I won't forget.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
One night.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry, I'll do it.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What is this?

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What is this?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
1 is long.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can I challenge once?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
15

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Can I?

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I count.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
1,2,3,4,5

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's like this.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please look at this.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want you to see this.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I worked hard here.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want you to see it

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's really good

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He really did his best

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He showed his long neck

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And tonight, Hosei will challenge that veteran entertainer

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The next challenger is Ho-Sei.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Ho-Sei's target is this person.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is Wakamishouji.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do you think?

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a little difficult.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's difficult. He's 10 years older than me.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's a veteran.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think it's difficult to suck the nipples of a veteran.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's the difficulty.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's the difficulty.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's start the Nipple Sucking Show.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hosei Hisei, let's go.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hello.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hello.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Good morning.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What?

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Good morning.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's here.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He's here.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He's here.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's wrong with you?

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's wrong with you?

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't stand this kind of talk.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, no, no.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Talking is...

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not normal.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm...

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What's with your face?

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm gonna end this!

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Please watch!

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's okay already!

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's watch!

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's watch!

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Watch?

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's watch! Please watch!

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Please watch!

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's already over?

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's pretty fast.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm a bit nervous.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Me too.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Me too?

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're so annoying.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're so annoying.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Can I sit with you?

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Can I sit with you?

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're not my mother!

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What are you doing?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Actually, I have to sit a lot this time.

156
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
On the show.

158
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Sit on what?

159
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,100
I'll sit on various things.

160
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
I think it's better to sit on this.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,100
Well, can I sit down for a moment?

162
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,000
Now?

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Yes.

164
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,200
May I?

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,000
No, I'm really sorry.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,500
Wait a minute, Mr. Shun.

167
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,300
What is it?

168
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Please sit down.

169
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Let's take off your clothes.

170
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Let's take off your clothes.

171
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
It's starting now.

172
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Let's go.

173
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Wait a minute.

174
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Please take off your mask.

175
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
You are an idiot.

176
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
What is this?

177
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
You are a fool.

178
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Wait a minute, Mr. Choy.

179
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Wait a minute.

180
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
Why are you asking me?

181
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Wait a minute.

182
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
So, how many seconds do you want me to ask?

183
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
How many seconds?

184
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
I don't know.

185
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
I don't know.

186
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Please explain it to me.

188
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
I'll ask you.

189
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
What the hell is that?

190
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
He's sitting down.

191
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
He's sitting down.

192
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
He's sitting down.

193
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
He's sitting down.

194
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
You two are...

195
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
...the same age?

196
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Please do it properly with my 926.

197
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
I got it.

198
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
I got it.

199
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
It's so hard.

200
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
It's not a joke.

201
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
It's not a joke.

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
It's so fun.

203
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
It's so fun!

204
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It looks so fun!

205
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
It's like they're playing together!

206
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
I don't know anymore!

207
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
I don't know anymore!

208
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
I don't know anymore!

209
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Wait a minute.

210
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Please give me a moment.

211
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
Don't hit me!

212
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
He's a real man!

213
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Hey, don't do that!

214
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Stop it!

215
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Okay.

216
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
It looked like he was having a lot of fun.

217
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
It was fun in the end, though.

218
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
How long did it take you to suck it?

219
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
It took about two seconds.

220
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
He didn't let me suck it that much.

221
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
But Shoji-san did.

222
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,300
I think Endo is the one who breathes the most.

223
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Well, it's a high-level breath.

224
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I breathed for about 30 seconds.

225
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,300
There were various forms of chikubisui.

226
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,300
The four teams are over.

227
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
How about the judges, Dan-dan?

228
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
That's right.

229
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Are you okay?

230
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Yes.

231
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Please announce the winner of the water king of the nipples!

232
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Please announce the winner of the water king of the nipples!

233
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
No one else!

234
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Wait a minute!

235
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Wait a minute!

236
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,300
I can't say that he's the king of the nipples.

237
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Really?

238
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I don't want to call him the king of the nipples.

239
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,300
I'm just doing it for fun.

240
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I need to change my target.

241
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Like a more actor.

242
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Like Umezawa-san.

243
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
No way!

244
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
No way!

245
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
No way!

246
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
I came to Tokyo just to get my nipples done.

247
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Just to get your nipples done?

248
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
I went back to Osaka just like that.

249
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Wait, wait.

250
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
I think there's still the second episode.

251
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
At that time,

252
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
I'll be wearing this mask.

253
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
I'll be wearing a mask that only the people who can sit on.

254
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Like, Sina Kippei.

255
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
That's a bit scary.

256
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
It's really scary.

257
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
It's okay to go to the other side, right?

258
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,300
If you don't go to the other side, it's a bit...

259
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,300
When you do the second time, think about the target a little more.

260
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Raise the hurdle a little more.

261
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
I think you should raise the target.

262
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I want you to do your best in the second time.

263
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
This was the Chikubi Watery Grand Prix. Thank you very much.

264
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Thank you very much.

265
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm going to challenge you to see if you can do the Chikubi.

266
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm really bad at Chikubi, so I'm waiting for you in the forest.

267
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I'm so nervous!

268
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Excuse me, Mr. Kibura.

269
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Mr. Kibura said,

270
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I'm not like that.

271
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
I thought,

272
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,300
how can you say that?

273
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
I'm really...

274
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
I don't think so.

275
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Excuse me.

276
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Excuse me.

277
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
No, no, no.

278
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I don't want you to do that.

279
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I thought you would reject me.

280
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,300
But surprisingly, you were so easy.

281
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Don't say that.

282
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
You were really not rejecting me.

283
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
You were so easy.

284
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
I thought you'd be proud if I sucked your nipples once.

285
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Please read it.

286
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
I didn't expect you to suck my nipples.

287
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
I was planning to do it.

288
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Thank you.

289
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
How was my nipple?

290
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Your nipple?

291
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Yes, it was cute.

292
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Thank you very much.

293
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Please leave a bad impression.

294
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
It was disgusting.

295
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Why did you have to be so mean to me?

296
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm back!

297
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Yes, this atmosphere is coming out!

298
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,300
I'm not mistaken!

299
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,300
The next day

300
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
I'll do something about Aoyakia.

301
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
What?

302
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Why do you hate it? I really don't want to do it.

303
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
You don't want to do it?

304
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,300
I really don't want to do it. But it can't be helped.

305
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I have a question for you, Mr. Downtown.

306
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,300
The other day, Tomoyo Harada released his 35th anniversary album.

307
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Don't you do anything about it?

308
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,300
I don't have anything to do with 35th anniversary.

309
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Oh, it's his first anniversary.

310
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Do you want to hold a dinner show?

311
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
What are you talking about?

312
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Dinner show?

313
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Do you want to do a dinner show?

314
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
I want to do the dinner show that I used to do in the old days.

315
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
I did it in a project.

316
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
What was that?

317
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,300
When we were singing, the staff were all dressed up and the rain was blowing.

318
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
We put on a hot thing.

319
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
It's violence.

320
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
The moon was funny.

321
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,300
That's why I said it's scary.

322
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
No, no.

323
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
The staff is sitting down.

324
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
It's a plan.

325
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
The staff is sitting down.

326
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Why is it so hot?

327
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
You were doing it too.

328
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Well, in the past, I was just doing it.

329
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
I dropped things.

330
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,300
This is the Downtown Dinner Show that was held 24 years ago.

331
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,300
The staff is enjoying the dinner show as the audience.

332
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,300
They are going to sing a variety of songs.

333
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
It's so fun.

334
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm going to get a lot of complaints.

335
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
I don't think it's going to work now.

336
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
It's not going to work now. It's going to come soon.

337
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Oh, really?

338
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
No, no.

339
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,300
There are a lot of people watching TV who are going to complain now.

340
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,300
The other day, I was on a different TV.

341
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
There was a story that made my wife angry.

342
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Well, for example, when I get home,

343
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Isn't there a time when your wife is on the phone?

344
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

345
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
There is, right?

346
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,920
And at that very moment...

347
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,760
...he said something.

348
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
Wait, wait......

349
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,100
You said, that's what I think.

350
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,220
What??

351
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,140
Did we call you passes easily?

352
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,000
Wait, wait...

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,340
My husband is on his way home.

354
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,340
He is already here.

355
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,420
Absolutely my first date with him.

356
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,440
My husband came from work,

357
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,640
I don't want to get close to him.

358
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,460
But I don' think you had a phone call.

359
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,760
No, no, no. What about you? What about you?

360
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,560
What?

361
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,260
You came back from work and your wife called you.

362
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,660
You have that kind of situation, right?

363
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Well, yes.

364
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
My answer is,

365
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,960
I just came back from work,

366
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,260
so I'll ask her once and call her again later.

367
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,160
That's my answer.

368
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,360
I'll ask her,

369
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,260
and say,

370
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Welcome back.

371
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,760
That's my answer.

372
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,460
You're so stubborn.

373
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Don't you think so?

374
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm so angry about that.

375
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I can't think of anything.

376
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,360
It's like an old-fashioned way of thinking.

377
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I'm sure it's true.

378
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,360
I'm calling because I have something to do.

379
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,360
You must be lying. You're amazing.

380
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
You're amazing at lying.

381
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
This is the house.

382
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
What?

383
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
No, it's a lie.

384
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Let's talk about the town.

385
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
What?

386
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
I don't know what's so funny.

387
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
It's 4 o'clock.

388
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
But you're home.

389
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Your husband is home.

390
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
But I told you after I came home.

391
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
This phone call is a long time.

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Yes, it's a long time.

393
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Then,

394
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'll tell you.

395
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
You look like you're angry.

396
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
I can't stand it if you make that face.

397
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
When I saw the picture, I was wondering what was going on.

398
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
But you said it was still being broadcasted.

399
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
It's so high.

400
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
When I said that it was still being broadcasted,

401
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I was told that I was a very low-key person.

402
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
And this atmosphere.

403
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Something like a bad guy.

404
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,360
And if this is broadcasted, I will be a bad guy again.

405
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
I don't think I can be a bad guy.

406
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,360
I think it's fine because there are many different ways of thinking.

407
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,360
You tell me too, the one who gets angry at his wife.

408
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm the only one who does it.

409
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
You tell me too.

410
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Sometimes when I go somewhere with my family,

411
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
like a car ride,

412
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
there are cars at home and mine,

413
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
but I don't use my car for that kind of thing.

414
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
I can't ride a car that well.

415
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
But there are cars for my family.

416
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
And then, well,

417
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
my family's car is usually my wife's car.

418
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,960
But when I go somewhere with my family, I get in this car.

419
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Well, it's a good chance.

420
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm driving at high speed, and gasoline isn't going in at all.

421
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
No, I'm going to get out of here.

422
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
Yes, you're angry, right?

423
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I think you should get mad on the way.

424
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
No, no.

425
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I know that I'm going somewhere with my family tomorrow.

426
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
But there are some cases where you can't get your wife in on that day.

427
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
You...

428
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
You...

429
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
You have a bad taste in women.

430
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
No, no, no!

431
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
That's not true!

432
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,760
If you do that, I'll break your wife's jaw!

433
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm sorry!

434
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sorry!

435
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
You're still in the drive recorder.

436
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,760
If you drink now, I'll have to buy it.

437
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
What an adult.

438
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Say it.

439
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Say it.

440
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
There's nothing.

441
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Don't lie.

442
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Say something that makes your wife angry.

443
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm the only one who's being told to say something.

444
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
You're being told to say something?

445
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm the one who said it.

446
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,760
If it was that kind of theme, I would say, for example, there is such a thing.

447
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Don't be fooled.

448
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
I didn't say it on my own.

449
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Say something.

450
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Say that I'm very hungry.

451
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
What are you talking about?

452
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Do you have that?

453
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,760
I can't change the water of the water server at all.

454
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,760
When it's reduced, it becomes like this.

455
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,760
When it's more, it becomes like this.

456
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm told to change it.

457
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I don't have it anymore, so I change it.

458
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
So you're like, what is it?

459
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Not for this!

460
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,740
Hold on, actually I'm somewhere in the editing studio

461
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm cutting all of your parts

462
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,720
No way, I'm done

463
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,640
Only because of this that you get angry, right?

464
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,980
I'm not angry, but I'm waiting for him to completely change.

465
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
You'll change when you realize it?

466
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
I'll change, but...

467
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,240
Eh? You'll change?

468
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,040
I'll change, but no matter how I think, he's trying to completely stick to me.

469
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,180
When there's about one last cup left, it's like a chicken race.

470
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
It's spicy, but...

471
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I can't drink until this guy drinks.

472
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,680
If I drink now, I have to go home.

473
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
What an adult.

474
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
You should go home quickly.

475
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Don't say that.

476
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,680
No, I can go home.

477
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
If you say so.

478
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
There is such a thing.

479
00:23:14,680 --> 00:22:57,700
Like a

480
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,680
It used to be.

481
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Say that like you used to do.

482
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Say the old days like you do now.

483
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Say it like that.

484
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Why are you talking so seriously?

485
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Are you crazy?

486
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,680
You should talk like you do now.

487
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,680
You can say it like you did 10 years ago, but you should say it like you did last week.

488
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
That's what talking is all about.

489
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,680
What are you going to do if you get 35,000 points?
