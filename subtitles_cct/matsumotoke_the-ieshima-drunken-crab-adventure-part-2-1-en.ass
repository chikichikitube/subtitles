It's a traditional Japanese way of serving food by the counter specifically only using the cooking methods of slicing, simmering, boiling, and steaming. Freshness is an image usually associated to it because it serves dishes that can only be served using fresh ingredients like sashimi.

Comment: 0,0:20:08.65,0:20:11.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Idk if you want to explain what this idiom means. But if you translate it literally, it means "I'm an amateur with hair", and it's used when someone treats you like a professional, but you want to express that you're not close enough to be a pro, but maybe a little above an amateur that just started. Matsumoto jokes and says that idiom is complicated because it clashes with the term kegani (haired crab)
