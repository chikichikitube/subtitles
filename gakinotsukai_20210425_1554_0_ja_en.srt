1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Check the bond between the parents and children of the Edo family

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hohohoi, the Nobel Prize is presented!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How about you? Have you ever received a Nobel Prize?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There's no way I have

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think you will

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There's no way I will

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today, the children of the Edo family

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There are two of them, right?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They're still small

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My father said he could win the Nobel Prize.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He said he could get it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why did he say that?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Because Hohohoi saved the world.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He said he could get the Nobel Prize.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today is the award ceremony for the Nobel Prize.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,540
You're so

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But it's amazing for the children.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They can get a lot of prizes for winning the Nobel Prize.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's amazing.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you okay?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can't stop me?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What do you mean?

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I mean, you can't stop me from making a Tokyo Tower.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you have money?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, it's a Nobel Prize.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nobel Prize?

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a Nobel Prize.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're saying too much.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're going to raise 100 sports cars.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But if you say that, the kids will be surprised.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Kokoriko Endo created a hit joke with a kid's use.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hohohoi

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This time, the two sons of the Edo family were invited to the ceremony as the Nobel Prize was awarded.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know what the Nobel Prize is.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Anyway, everyone is really amazing about me.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You know, the hohohoi hohohoi thing.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's what everyone in the world, especially children, are happy about.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I'm going to give you an award for that.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Edo family has prepared many luxury items as the prize of the Nobel Prize.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Among them are the dinosaur figurines that Shonan Sora-kun wants,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and the rideable radio control car that Jinan Uta-kun adores.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
However, in order to obtain these luxury awards,

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,300
They must achieve this in the awards ceremony.

48
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
There are certain conditions.

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,600
In the end, the children will do the hohohoi.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
If the children don't get excited,

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
the Nobel Prize might disappear.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
If the children hear this,

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
they might laugh for their father and for the hohohoi.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
And they want that.

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,100
They want that.

56
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Usually, there is no reason to laugh at the Hohoi.

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
I don't think so.

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,100
So, there are many people who are prepared.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,100
In that sense, it is about how much the children laugh at the Hohoi.

60
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
What is it?

61
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,100
The ceremony is about to begin.

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,100
To make Sora and Uta believe that this is a real Nobel Prize,

63
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,100
the award ceremony has prepared several hidden cameras and extra foreigners.

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,100
The four of them will monitor the performance of the Eendouken in a different room.

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Endo Prefecture, time travel, we have arrived at the award ceremony.

66
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
We have arrived.

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Wow, look at this.

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
This is the reception.

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Wow, congratulations, thank you.

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Congratulations on the award.

71
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Thank you.

72
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Wow, this is a red carpet.

73
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Hello, what's your name?

74
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Suwa-kun

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Suwa-kun, what's your name?

76
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Usa-kun

77
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
How old are you?

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
5 years old

79
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
How old are you?

80
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
3 years old

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
You're a big brother!

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
First, let's celebrate with champagne

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Let's eat.

84
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Can you clap for me?

85
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
No, no, no.

86
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Endo, you are starting to believe this, aren't you?

87
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
What kind of a fool are you?

88
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
I don't know.

89
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,100
After the reception, Endo goes to the control room.

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
This is the changing room.

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
It looks like a hotel.

92
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Let's sit down.

93
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,100
It's no use to make a room for the Nobel Prize winner.

94
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
It's nothing.

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Really?

96
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
You just put the sofa there.

97
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Sorry.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
You are reproducing it.

99
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
What's wrong?

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Like juice?

101
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Suddenly?

102
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Do you drink juice?

103
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
No, I don't.

104
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
You look nervous.

105
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm nervous.

106
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Do you want to win the Nobel Prize?

107
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Yes.

108
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Are you listening?

109
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Are you listening?

110
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
What are you doing?

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
What?

112
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
You can't win the Nobel Prize from such a person.

113
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Do you want to buy a flower?

114
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Yes, I do.

115
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
You thought it was bad, didn't you?

116
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Your wife is laughing and blowing the candle.

117
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Well, you have to laugh.

118
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,100
What will you do if your father's Nobel Prize is gone?

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
I don't want it.

120
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
No, I will destroy the water.

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
What?

122
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I will throw away the water.

123
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Who?

124
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Dad did.

125
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Dad did? Why?

126
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Because he was married.

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
This is how you talk to your children, right?

128
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
This is how you talk to your children, right?

129
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
It's not funny at all.

130
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
This is how you talk to your children.

131
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,100
Before the Nobel Prize ceremony, the main venue is visible.

132
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Thank you.

133
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Everyone is clapping.

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Watching toys makes me excited.

135
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
That's right.

136
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
You can watch toys here.

137
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
It makes you excited.

138
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
This is the venue for the Onberi Show.

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
It's empty, isn't it?

140
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
He's already stopped.

141
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
His eyes are fixed.

142
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
That's right.

143
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,100
His eyes are fixed even when he's completely stopped.

144
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
What is this?

145
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
What is this?

146
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I got a toy!

147
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Wait, don't touch it yet!

148
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Don't touch it yet!

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Look! Look!

150
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Look!

151
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Look!

152
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
You usually eat it smoothly!

153
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
You eat it smoothly, right?

154
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Is this your sword?

155
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Look! Look!

156
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
You can eat it really well!

157
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Look!

158
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
It's really amazing.

159
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
That ball is amazing.

160
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Hey, you can eat a lot of this.

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
What is a tsuru tsuru?

162
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Hey, leave it there.

163
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
When he returned to the engine room,

164
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,100
he was busy with the Nobel Prize in the world's Vip and other commemorative photos.

165
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Thank you very much.

166
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Thank you.

167
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
And Tanaka, his partner.

168
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
It's been a while.

169
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Congratulations.

170
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
No, no, I'm sorry.

171
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
You've been saying that you wanted to win the Nobel Prize since you were a kid.

172
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I want to win it.

173
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
If you can win it, then go ahead and ask.

174
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Isn't it amazing?

175
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Dad, you won the Nobel Prize!

176
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Right?

177
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Congratulations!

178
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Thank you.

179
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
You became a partner of the Nobel Prize.

180
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Well, that's true.

181
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Yes.

182
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
See you later.

183
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
See you later.

184
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Bye bye.

185
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Bye bye.

186
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Bye bye.

187
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Bye bye.

188
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Please.

189
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Please.

190
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
How was it?

191
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Did it hurt?

192
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Yes, it didn't really echo.

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I felt it.

194
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
It didn't echo that much.

195
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
It didn't really hit me.

196
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
It hurts weirdly.

197
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Let's go, Jotaro.

198
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm sure the two of them will be happy.

199
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
We should go too.

200
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
I guess so.

201
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm sure they'll be happy.

202
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Are they crying?

203
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Yes.

204
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I wonder what the children will think of the downtown.

205
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Oh, that's right.

206
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Congratulations!

207
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
I'm really surprised!

208
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Hello!

209
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
This is Hama-chan.

210
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Yes, Hama-chan.

211
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Thank you very much.

212
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Do you know what prize you will get?

213
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
What prize?

214
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
A ball.

215
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
What?

216
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
It's hot.

217
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
What are you talking about?

218
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm glad you laughed.

219
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I'm sorry to say this, but...

220
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,100
I have a friend who asked me to buy you a sign.

221
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Oh, no problem.

222
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
All three of us.

223
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Can you make it round?

224
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
No problem.

225
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Oh, it's good.

226
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
It's a Nobel Prize.

227
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Here you are.

228
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Thank you.

229
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
I'll come again.

230
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Thank you.

231
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Thank you!

232
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
You've seen it, right?

233
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Matcha and Hamachan.

234
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
They're on TV, right?

235
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Dad is amazing!

236
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Thank you.

237
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Dad is amazing.

238
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Good job.

239
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
I got it.

240
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
You got it.

241
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It's not important.

242
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I don't know what's left.

243
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
I'm sending a message to the secretary.

244
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,100
The Hohohoi Nobel Prize for the Happening.

245
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,100
From now on, I will be giving the Nobel Prize to the En-do Shouzo, Hohohoi.

246
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Now, Mr. Hohohoi, who has received the Nobel Prize, will enter the stage.

247
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
It's a song.

248
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:22,100
It's been played all over the world.

249
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Thank you.

250
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Thank you.

251
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,100
First, I would like to give a trophy and a medal to the Chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee, Mr. Nobel.

252
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,780
burner.

253
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,400
Lady Kyun hospital,

254
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
Mr. Einsatz,

255
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:27,760
You have been doing hohohoi for 23 years.

256
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I hereby declare that I have made a solemn pledge to the world peace.

257
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Thank you very much.

258
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Oh, the kids are paying attention.

259
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Thank you very much.

260
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Now, please take a photo of the memorial.

261
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
This is embarrassing.

262
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
It says Nobel Prize.

263
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:23,760
And today, we have received a congratulatory comment from this person.

264
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
No way.

265
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
A congratulatory comment?

266
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Hi, Shozo.

267
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Today, I'm sending a congratulatory message to my old friend, Shozo, from the White House.

268
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
That's too much.

269
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm sorry I couldn't attend the award ceremony directly.

270
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I just took office and I couldn't leave.

271
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Hohohoi is the symbol of world peace.

272
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,760
On behalf of the American people, I offer you our sincere congratulations.

273
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Shouzo, congratulations on winning the Nobel Prize.

274
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Hohohoi.

275
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:18,760
And today, these people have also come to the venue to congratulate you.

276
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Please come up to the stage.

277
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Thank you!

278
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Congratulations!

279
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Thank you!

280
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
It was really good.

281
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Thank you.

282
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm proud of you.

283
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm proud of you.

284
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Thank you.

285
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm your senior, but I'm proud of your junior for winning such a wonderful award.

286
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Congratulations.

287
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Thank you.

288
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,760
I'm really happy that the word Hohohoi has become a common word in the world.

289
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Please keep up the good work. I'm really proud of you.

290
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Congratulations.

291
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,760
I think the way of thinking will change after the award.

292
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
The way of thinking.

293
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I think it's not the way of thinking that has been done before.

294
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
I would like to see it.

295
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Thank you very much.

296
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,760
From here, we will answer the questions from foreign media reporters from all over the world.

297
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Thank you for the Nobel Prize.

298
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Thank you.

299
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,760
What is Hohohoi to you?

300
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Well, it's a joke that came out of nowhere.

301
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,760
It's something that came out when I was really cornered.

302
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Actually, it was about 25 years ago.

303
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm not interested.

304
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I didn't even think I'd win the Nobel Prize in this way.

305
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,760
As Hamada-san said, I think it's the opposite of what I said earlier.

306
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm really in my 50s, so I'm focusing on the children of this world.

307
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,760
If you could laugh at my hohoi, I think it would be a good ending.

308
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
It's not like that. I'm 3 years old, so I'm worried.

309
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,760
If you have any unexpected difficulties in hohohoi, please tell me.

310
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:40,760
There was a good side to the story because of Hohohoi, but there was also a night when he crushed me.

311
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,760
What are you talking about?

312
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,760
A night when he crushed me.

313
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:58,760
After this, Mr. Endo will be able to show the Hohohoi that he won at the Nobel Prize.

314
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,760
This model will be broadcasted on the same channel in over 120 countries around the world.

315
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Mr. Endo, please prepare the Hohohoi.

316
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Mr. Sawa, it's about time.

317
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Yes, I wonder what kind of reaction the children will show.

318
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Do you want to see the reaction?

319
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Yes, I want them to smile for their father.

320
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,760
The people at the venue are moved.

321
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Nobody is laughing.

322
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm curious to see what they think when they feel that way.

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

324
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Mr. Hou Houi.

325
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,760
The end of the novel by the novelist Shouzo.

326
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Isn't this the bakery?

327
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Oh, it's this way.

328
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Oh, this way.

329
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Oh, I see.

330
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Oh, they're laughing.

331
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
What do you think of the tattoos?

332
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
The two of them are laughing.

333
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Do you know the rhythm of the Sampa?

334
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
To make the world peaceful!

335
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
They're laughing.

336
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
They're laughing!

337
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
It's fun.

338
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
It's fun.

339
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
This is a good family song.

340
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Yes.

341
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
It's a natural family song.

342
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,760
That was the end of the show.

343
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Everyone, once again, a big round of applause.

344
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Overall, I don't think they've received it very well.

345
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
They haven't received it.

346
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
They're going to be sent home like this.

347
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
They're the ones who won the Nobel Prize.

348
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,760
They're the ones who won the free open-air bath.

349
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,760
They've safely finished their hard work and have a peaceful endo-ke.

350
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Next Day

351
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,760
The atmosphere changes immediately.

352
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Even children can understand.

353
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
He's really angry.

354
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

355
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,760
His father is being scolded by a foreigner.

356
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
He was angry.

357
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
He was angry.

358
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
He was angry.

359
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Why?

360
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,760
You know how I did the Nobel Prize?

361
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Yes.

362
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
I did it like this.

363
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Did you laugh?

364
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I laughed.

365
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Did you laugh?

366
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
I laughed a little.

367
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
A little?

368
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
You shouldn't laugh a little.

369
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:08,760
If you don't laugh, the dinosaur toy, the car, the food, the refrigerator, the coffee, everything will be gone.

370
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
OK? Can I have it?

371
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
No.

372
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
You don't want it, do you?

373
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I'll try again.

374
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Try laughing.

375
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
I'll do it.

376
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Don't make me do it.

377
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Don't make me do it completely.

378
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Make a voice.

379
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,760
It's not that funny.

380
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
It's good.

381
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
It's a big laugh.

382
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,760
To show the proper Hohohoi for the Nobel Prize, the Edo family returned to the venue once again.

383
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:17,760
The big laughter from the first time was heard in the venue.

384
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
The song came out like this.

385
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Dad couldn't see it, but I had to concentrate on the method.

386
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Everyone was watching.

387
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
It was a little different.

388
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
The number of the number has changed.

389
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm scared.

390
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

391
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Can you listen to me?

392
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
I'll do it one more time.

393
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I'll give you one more chance.

394
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
I want to see you again.

395
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I was taken away.

396
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm really tired.

397
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I'll practice it once.

398
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
One, two, three, go!

399
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
You're making me do it all over again!

400
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm going to do it with the table!

401
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm going to do it with the table!

402
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
You're not laughing, are you?

403
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
You're not looking?

404
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
You're just screaming.

405
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
It's really close, right?

406
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Now, the last chance. The strong bond between the parents of the children of the endo.

407
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Watch it carefully.

408
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
I'll spread my arms.

409
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Here it comes!

410
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I haven't done anything yet.

411
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
What are you doing?

412
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
You haven't done anything yet.

413
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
I'm not going to die.

414
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Everyone, please give a round of applause for Mr. Hontoro Kazaki.

415
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Thank you!

416
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Thank you for your hard work!

417
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
It was great! It was great!

418
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Today, the members gave gifts to Sora and Uta who worked hard for their father.

419
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Thank you!

420
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
It was great!

421
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
It was great today!

422
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Bye!

423
00:23:42,760 --> 00:24:11,100
