1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is a big scoop!

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll take the brave side of today!

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
dying

5
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Waaaaah..... exploted

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Uwaaaaa!

7
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,480
After the first giant monster appeared, the government started to collect the situation.

8
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Everyone, today at 3.30 pm, a giant monster was confirmed.

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:35,480
As a result of the characteristics, the giant monster is believed to be Yamaram.

10
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Thank you for your time.

11
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:50,480
The appearance of this giant monster is the greatest crisis for our country, but it is also a serious problem for all countries.

12
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Of course, if that's what you're talking about, we know exactly what you mean.

13
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,480
You see, I'm not going to give up. What do you think will happen to us?

14
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Prime Minister, please say something!

15
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I can't solve anything by keeping silent, Prime Minister!

16
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,480
That's Yamada, isn't it? It's harder than I thought.

17
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
What the hell is Yamada?

18
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,760
assembler

19
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
Yama...

20
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,900
Yama is angry

21
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,200
Because of unanalog human trip

22
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,560
Exellent has come to place the refugees in problema foreset

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Finally, the tax conflict is smoke leaky

24
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
This is a big scoop again!

25
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Alright, let's do this!

26
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Roger!

27
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
What should I do with this guy?

28
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:43,800
From now on, I will not be able to attack. What should I do?

29
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
This is a scoop.

30
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
The people are crying.

31
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Unless we stop the destruction of the environment,

32
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Ahhhh!

33
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Yamaramu is crying.

34
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
As long as humans don't stop destroying the environment,

35
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Yamaramu will continue to destroy the city.

36
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,900
The Civil greetout has lower security than 핑계� bei hundreds.

37
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,960
Everbody, Get away of the Channel,

38
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,020
Which means,

39
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,460
This channel will be shoot down,

40
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:17,660
Soиюu

41
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,280
In Order to run the cool channel.

42
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Zae

43
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,260
The next day

44
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,260
At that time, at a certain lab, something strange happened to a man.

45
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
The next day

46
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
What was the next one?

47
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
This one?

48
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
I think it was this.

49
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Hey, Yamada, stop destroying the town!

50
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Who the hell is that guy?

51
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,260
He's a giant monster!

52
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
That's not a giant monster.

53
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
It's a dynamite.

54
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Poor thing, it suddenly turned into a giant monster.

55
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,260
What?

56
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,900
From here, we'll go to the

57
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
From here on, I will be your opponent!

58
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Stop it, Yama-ramu.

60
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Yama-ramu has no power.

61
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,900
He's a hot cloud that envelopes your heart.

62
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Now, Yoram, it's time to sleep.

63
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
What's wrong?

64
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Yamaramu, what's wrong?

65
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Yamaramu suddenly became quiet.

66
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
What the hell happened?

67
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Yamaramu's death caused the death of the fireman.

68
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,900
The fireman's voice made Yamaramu quiet.

69
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
I see.

70
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
I see.

71
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Hey!

72
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Hey!

73
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Hey!

74
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh!

75
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Yamaramu is coming back!

76
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Yamaramu,

77
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Goodbye!

79
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Goodbye!

80
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Goodbye!

81
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Peaceful days will return!

82
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Thank you!

83
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Okay, thank you very much!

84
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Thank you very much!

85
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

86
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Matsumoto-san, you have returned Sadako from TV to TV.

88
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
How did you do it?

89
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Well, the spiritual part...

90
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,900
I have a license to do many things as a carpenter.

91
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,900
It's not enough to pay for it.

92
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Oh, that's not enough.

93
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
I'll do it again.

95
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
You can do it.

96
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
But I don't have a license.

97
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Did you see it?

98
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,900
No, I didn't.

99
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm scared.

100
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,900
You're scared.

101
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,900
What did you do?

102
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,900
I'm not bragging, but I have two TVs.

103
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,900
I put the screen on the TV and left it like this.

104
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,900
I was surprised, but I did it right away.

105
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Just around here.

106
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,900
I heard that you have been to a high school with strict rules that you can get into three fingers in the whole country.

107
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Please tell us what kind of strict rules you had.

108
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
I was a mission type.

109
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
I heard it for the first time.

110
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
I had a star on my finger.

111
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
And, um, I had a sprain.

112
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
Yes.

113
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
I had three sprains.

114
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
That's a lot.

115
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
What kind of strictness was that?

116
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
It was 5.30 in the morning.

117
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
In the morning?

118
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
Yes.

119
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
If you were late by 5.30, you couldn't enter the room.

120
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
I see.

121
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,900
That was really scary.

122
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
The teacher was really scary.

123
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Almost everyone had a face like a Tengu on the cover of a beef jerky.

124
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,900
I don't get it.

125
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
I don't get it.

126
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,900
It's so annoying.

127
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,900
The door is white but it's so red.

128
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:15,900
It's so red that the white door is red.

129
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
I'm so angry.

130
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,900
I've been angry for about 4 and a half hours.

131
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,900
I'm so irritated.

132
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm scared.

133
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
I understand that you're scared.

134
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I'm really scared.

135
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
I understand that you're scared.

136
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Please tell me strict rules.

137
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Well, I can't do anything.

138
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
For example?

139
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,900
First, you can't do anything unless you wear no sleeves.

140
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
No sleeves? What's no sleeves?

141
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Students' clothes.

142
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,900
If you are not wearing no sleeves, you are not a student.

143
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
You know, there are people who do tattoos.

144
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
That's why I had to do it.

145
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
So I had to wear no sleeves.

146
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
I see.

147
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Anyway, you had a face like a tengu.

148
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I just said it.

149
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
I can't say anything.

150
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
It's amazing.

151
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Karan Karan Karan Karan

152
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I've got a lot of them.

153
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Like a leaf.

154
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Always. Because it's hot.

155
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
It's this big.

156
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
One leaf.

157
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
It's huge.

158
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
I was really scared.

159
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Yeah.

160
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
When I got hit.

161
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
You get hit a lot.

162
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
You get hit a lot.

163
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
You get hit a lot.

164
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
So I get hit a lot.

165
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,900
I couldn't pull it back.

166
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,900
I was hit all the time.

167
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,900
Do you understand?

168
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
It was really hard.

169
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Anyway, it was really red.

170
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
It was really red.

171
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,900
The white wall was red.

172
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
It was really strong.

173
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
So I can't enter from the front door.

174
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
But I can enter from the back door.

175
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Because I'm scared.

176
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
There's no one on the back door.

177
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
It's not that strict at all.

178
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
What are you talking about?

179
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,900
It's really strict.

180
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
It's not strict. It's just standing there with a red face.

181
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
It's not strict at all.

182
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Don't say rude things.

183
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
I've been through this for three years.

184
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
If you have a grudge, you'll be in trouble.

185
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,900
That's true for the story that you just go to school.

186
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
What kind of strict rules are there?

187
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
It's amazing.

188
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
You have a red face.

189
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Then you shouldn't say it.

190
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
It's full of Doberman.

191
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Classroom.

192
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Why?

193
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
I'm like...

194
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
I'm like...

195
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,900
I made a little mistake and used eraser.

196
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,900
I can't make a mistake.

197
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I just used eraser.

198
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,900
This is a world like that.

199
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm not a law.

200
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,900
I'm just doing the same thing.

201
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
I said, tell me the rules!

202
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
No overbucket!

203
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
You should say that.

204
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
No rubber overbucket!

205
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
What do you mean rubber?

206
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I mean, the rubber on the top of the bucket.

207
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
They say it's beautiful.

208
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
If it's like this, it's a nuisance.

209
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Everyone's like,

210
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
I'm going to get caught right away.

211
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
I'm going to move a little bit.

212
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Everyone's like,

213
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
I'm going to stand up again.

214
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
I'm going to stand up again.

215
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I said, it's fine!

216
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
It's fine!

217
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
You're saying something weird.

218
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
What's weird?

219
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
No, the leaflet, it's working!

220
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Why are you laughing?

221
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
I can't see it with my tears.

222
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I heard that you went to a high school that was as strict as three fingers in the whole country.

223
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Please tell me what strict rules you had.

224
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,900
Pen name, school boy.

225
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,200
So,

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,300
I had a red face on the back of the school gate.

227
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,000
I didn't care if I was standing or not.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,700
You had a red face, right?

229
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,800
Well, if you ask me.

230
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,900
If you ask me?

231
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,400
If you ask me, what do you mean?

232
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,900
You had a red face, right?

233
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,100
Oh, you mean the teacher?

234
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Yeah, I think that one was quite red.

235
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
You had a face as red as the one in the movie, right?

236
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Ah, I don't know if that's true, but it was red, surprisingly.

237
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
So, maybe that's why.

238
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
You had a leaf, right?

239
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
A leaf?

240
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Ah, maybe once in three years.

241
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Well, it was close to not having.

242
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
You wore a Geta of Ichimaeba, right?

243
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Not at all.

244
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Not even once.

245
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
But really, it was tough.

246
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
It was quite tough.

247
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
It was quite tough.

248
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
What is it? What is it?

249
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
What is it?

250
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
What is it?

251
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm doing it properly, right?

252
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,100
You're the one who broke it.

253
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,100
I'm going to deny everything you said, so it's strange, right?

254
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
What did you deny?

255
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,100
You were scared because you had a red face, right?

256
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Don't say that.

257
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Don't say that.

258
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
It's not a story.

259
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Say it. Say it for the first time.

260
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I didn't say that! I didn't say that you have a red face!

261
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
With a red face...

262
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
I didn't say that!

263
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:44,100
The garbage is being sorted by the garbage, the garbage that burns, the garbage that doesn't burn, the plastic bottles, the garbage that is very fine.

264
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,100
How is the sorted garbage processed?

265
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Yorai Motto, let's be serious.

266
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Yes, let's be serious.

267
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Simply put, we're burning everything together.

268
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
It's not like that.

269
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Then, here...

270
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
There's no need to separate it.

271
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
We're not burning it.

272
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
You know, even if we separate,

273
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:20,100
There are things that you want me to burn with you at the end.

274
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,800
At that time, we broke up, but...

275
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,340
After all, again...

276
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,780
At the end, I'm with you.

277
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,660
There are things like that.

278
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:37,260
You have a very surprised face.

279
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,820
There are things like that.

280
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,300
You've seen a lot of couples like that, haven't you?

281
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
I don't know that.

282
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
For example, it's the same as that.

283
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
How do you do it?

284
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
I burn it all at once.

285
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,300
After all, it's like, I'll take it apart, I'll take it apart.

286
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I'm doing something bad.

287
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,300
Who are you talking about?

288
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
It's the health department.

289
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Let's take it apart.

290
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
I said, let's split it up with a burning fire.

291
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I thought it was impossible.

292
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I see.

293
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
But surprisingly, everyone was honest.

294
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
You were divided.

295
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Yes, I was.

296
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
I split it up.

297
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
It's a bottle.

298
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Oh, this is a bottle.

299
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
It's a can.

300
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Oh, I put the can here.

301
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
This is burning garbage.

302
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Oh, OK, OK, OK.

303
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
This is not burning.

304
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Oh, OK, OK, OK.

305
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
BAM! BOOM!

306
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Why are you angry?

307
00:20:53,300 --> 00:21:00,300
I want to use the word mitarashi dango in other situations, but what kind of situation should I use it in?

308
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
I use it a lot.

309
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Really?

310
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Yes.

311
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
The email address of my phone is also called,

312
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Me-ar-tara-shi.

313
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Do you use that much?

314
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
I use it all the time.

315
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Do you use that much?

316
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
If it's called Me,

317
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
it's called Tara-shi.

318
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
If you use it that much,

319
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
what kind of position do you use

320
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
to use it?

321
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I use it quite often.

322
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Even through the year.

323
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Please tell me.

324
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
When do you use it?

325
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I think I get irritated a lot.

326
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
I get irritated a lot.

327
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
For example?

328
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
For example, what do you mean?

329
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
I'll ask him.

330
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
For example?

331
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
What do you mean?

332
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Well, this kind of thing...

333
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
It's difficult to say it.

334
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Why?

335
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
It's embarrassing.

336
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
It's too much.

337
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
It's like you're forcing it.

338
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
It hurts more naturally.

339
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I can't see it.

340
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
You usually hit it, right?

341
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
You use the word, looking at it.

342
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
I hit it all the time.

343
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
You use it when you're angry, right?

344
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
I often use it when I'm angry.

345
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
When I wait for a signal for a long time.

346
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,300
and the traffic light was turned on, and he got off again.

347
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
You'll see that a lot.

348
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
You're saying that even if I take off my shoes?

349
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Of course!

350
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
No, it's not that.

351
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Sometimes it's long after getting off.

352
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
It is.

353
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
It's just normal.

354
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
It's so long!

355
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
It's just so long!

356
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
I'll say it when I'm waiting.

357
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I'll say it when I'm waiting.

358
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
That's not it.

359
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Sometimes it's like that.

360
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
What do you say then?

361
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
It's so long!

362
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
I just got off!

363
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I'm still waiting!

364
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
What's this?

365
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Shut up!

366
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Where's Mutarashi?

367
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Mutarashi?

368
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
I didn't say Mutarashi.

369
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Mutarashi?

370
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Mutarashi is angry.

371
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
At times like that?

372
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,300
No, he doesn't come out now.

373
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,300
And there are a lot of people in the convenience store.

374
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
There are two refrigerators.

375
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
And there are three people at work.

376
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
I know.

377
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
I'm not doing anything, but I'm opening this.

378
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Hey!

379
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
You can't be a king!

380
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Why are you opening this?

381
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
There are a few people working here.

382
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
If you open this,

383
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
everyone will be faster.

384
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Hurry up!

385
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
I'm not a fool.

386
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
I'm not a fool.

387
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Everyone in this room is a fool!

388
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
I'm in the show!

389
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
I'm in the show!

390
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
What's with that?

391
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:30,980
I want to eat the

392
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,980
I want to eat the

393
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
The people in front are also in the show!

394
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
It has nothing to do with the show

395
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
I'm just in the show

396
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Why do you say that?

397
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Well, when you are on the train, there are people parking their cars at the Nishito station

398
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Ah, that happens sometimes

399
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
That makes you feel good

400
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
I was so tired.

401
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Right?

402
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
And then...

403
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
You were there for a long time.

404
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
I was there.

405
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I was so angry.

406
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
I was so angry.

407
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
I was so angry.

408
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
I said,

409
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Mr. Mitadashi!

410
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I was scared.

411
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
That was fast, wasn't it?

412
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:24,300
