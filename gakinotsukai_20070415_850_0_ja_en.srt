00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
April 5th, this day, Yamasaki Kokoriko from Downtown became the judge and the new regular member audition was held.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Who will be the participants of this audition?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Please come in.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, everyone.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The new regular of the Gaki no Tsukai.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ode-san.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
From now on,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
whether you are suitable for the Gaki no Tsukai.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We will carefully decide.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is what it is.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Everyone, thank you.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, first of all, let's introduce ourselves.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
From the left.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Which one is left?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm fine with it.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
From the left.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Excuse me.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm Tokuyoshi Mi, 31 years old, from Kyoto.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm Fuzesu, nice to meet you.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What did you say?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm Fukuda from Tutorial.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fukuda-kun?

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Nice to meet you.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm Tamura from Yoshimoto Koukyou. Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm Kirin. Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm Kosugi from Black Mayonnaise.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm the champion.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Nice to meet you.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What do you mean by champion?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The champion of M1.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's 2005, right?

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, from here on, everyone, you have your own good things.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There are various things.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then, I wonder if you can bring it.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, we've done it after all.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not difficult at all.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not difficult at all.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, everyone, do you know what this is in front of you?

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Karashi-renkon?

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, Karashi-renkon.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a simple story.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Try to suck up the Karashi.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's try to suck up the Karashi of Karashi-renkon.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tamura, you try.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll suck it up.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The other members, please sit down.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, yes.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's thick.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's my first time seeing a sad lotus root.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What should I do? I'll suck it up.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Try it.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll do my best.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Like this.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, yes.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's good.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can just suck it up.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can hold it up to here.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's the image.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, okay.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to suck it up.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry for the failure.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll go.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know if it's done.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's done.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's spicy.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The spiciness is coming.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought I could go with more youthful image.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I wonder if it won't come suddenly.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It won't come suddenly.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It won't come suddenly.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't pull it!

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll do it.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm facing you.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Please.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can do it like this.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Especially.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll do it.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's working.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's this?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's pulling.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's pulling.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is it that low?

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, it wasn't like that.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, it's gone.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a bit low.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It looks like it.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why?

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It doesn't look like it.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It wasn't like that at all.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's the third one.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yossha!

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes?

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's because it's hot.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hurry up.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Excuse me.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll have it.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's hard to swallow.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can you do it?

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can do it.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why are you not breathing?

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm just breathing.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're not breathing at all.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why?

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Breathe in.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's enough.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Masugi!

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Is this okay?

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't think it's too much of a blow.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You don't have to avoid it.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can talk here.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But look at it. How is it? Can you do it?

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I've been holding back for a long time.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You mean the stimulus?

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I see.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You've been holding back for a long time.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll hit the head.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll hit the head.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Choose a good one.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's already started.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not just about choosing one.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's your choice.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Like this.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I sucked it up.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's really beautiful.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's beautiful.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's beautiful.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's beautiful to open the hole.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
From here?

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Kiri Kiri Koukou!

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Congratulations!

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Kiri Kiri Koukou!

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's Kiri Kiri!

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If you say it without a key, it's the most...

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Kiri Kiri Koukou!

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Take?

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do it.

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll do it.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, that's so bold.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I didn't think of this idea.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is good.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's stuck.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's stuck.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's good.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're almost there.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, it hurts.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's impossible to close it.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's different.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The hole is different.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Check it.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Check it and try it.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's right.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They are saying it too.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not sure.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Just barely passed!

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It was a short one.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Next, we have a newbie.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Please give him a nickname.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll start.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
First, this person.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The person who's done.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The person who's done.

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
YOSHIDA.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What do you mean by a waste?

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A waste.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A scheme.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A scheme?

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Tatarin of the lower town.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Minoru Shiraki.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's all?

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Iida.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Iida Shoko.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's not Ada.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ah, sorry.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is it like that?

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Next person, please.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Here you go.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Here you go.

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You idiot.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Here you go.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Free.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Here you go.

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're taking a break again?

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I see.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Michelangelo.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Sky Blue.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's the point.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's looking good.

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Next person, please.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is difficult.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I see.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is difficult.

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's difficult.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're going to see the orchestra right away.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a bit long.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The adagio.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Ah, the adagio.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Teresa.

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Teresa.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Spanko.

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ouch.

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hogarakka.

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't take notes so often.

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's my nickname.

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Tamura-san.

237
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tamura-san.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, sorry.

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's move on.

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a nickname.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's a nickname.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tight.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What kind of girl is she?

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you going to jog again?

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
In Adana.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you kidding me?

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's possible that you'll be fired.

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This is the third time.

249
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
In Adana.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Please do it in Adana.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Jackson.

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A lot.

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Restaurant.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's difficult.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's go to the next one.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I see.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is a method.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
One-Action. This is good.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is good, isn't it?

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Mrs. Time Machine.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can go to the worst.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's your feelings.

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can go to the worst.

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's your name.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Next.

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Telekura.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you going to look at my hand again?

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Um...

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Tamura-kun.

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Please give me a nickname.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm going to quit.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is this on purpose?

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, I'm just doing it for fun.

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Please give me a nickname.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There are more categories than people.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm going to reflect on my actions.

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll do it like this.

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Then I'll try to make it short.

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But if you're going to be called a restaurant, that's better.

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you very much.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Somehow luxurious!

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you very much.

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Kotsugi!

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Kotsugi and Fukuda!

289
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You've chosen two amazing people.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's do a game of Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah?

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll tell you what you'll do.

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is a big one.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Try it quickly.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes, yes. Sorry.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is Godzilla, right?

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The neck is white.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Pass! Pass!

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No, it's fine.

301
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Can you do it around here?

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, yes.

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Come a little closer.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's fine if you use this part.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I wanted to see it closer.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This part is not good.

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is a field, so it's OK.

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You can use it here.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You can touch it.

310
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can touch it.

311
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Can I do it here?

312
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
OK.

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
OK, start.

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
OK.

315
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Pass!

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh that's good.

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I passed.

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I just passed.

319
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The power of that sword is different.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The raw power of that sword is different.

321
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The one that can be cut can take it.

322
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Go ahead.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Just cut it!

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So who wants to play Godzilla?

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What?

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who wants to play Godzilla?

327
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah?

328
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll do it.

329
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Go ahead.

330
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, a little more forward.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If possible, come to the place where you can touch.

332
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's close.

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's close.

334
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well then, I'll do it.

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, it's 5 o'clock.

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Pass!

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is a pass.

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're amazing.

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Amazing.

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He's got a lot of power.

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's totally different.

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Alright!

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hurry up.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hurry up.

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Try it.

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hurry up.

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Run.

348
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Please.

349
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Run as if you're hitting the shoulder.

350
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's okay.

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's okay.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This was better than I thought.

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think it's better to show it like this.

354
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's better to show it like this.

355
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, then...

356
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Kasugi!

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Did you get sick again?

358
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

359
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Did you get sick again?

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No, I didn't.

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's okay.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Now, please stand up.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, this is a bit of a sudden request, but...

364
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'd like to sing a song by a tuna fisherman.

365
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'd like to sing a song by a tuna fisherman from Oma.

366
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think it's too easy.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The sea, in the sea there is a man's mirror.

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
In one mirror, a tuna is reflected.

369
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Gouka!

370
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That was wonderful.

371
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It was wonderful.

372
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was wonderful.

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, what he said was a mess.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes.

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Parula!

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Tuna fish dish.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, that's not it.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's not?

379
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The bride's song waiting for the fisherman to return.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The bride's position is...

381
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The bride's...

382
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Sorry, it's about the bride.

383
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Please.

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay.

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Not yet, not yet, my darling, not yet, darling, darling.

386
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Tiritiritokyo!

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's a waste!

388
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You're really...

389
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're really a pain in the neck!

390
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Thank you.

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's a close call.

392
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Hmm...

393
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Kosugi!

394
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I just got a new name.

395
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mr. Katsumi.

396
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes.

397
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Please sing a song to celebrate the big success.

398
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh, that's good.

399
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I see.

400
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Please.

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes.

403
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
For such a simple thing.

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes.

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
For Kosugi, it's nothing.

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Come here, come here.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Come to me!

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Go, go, go, go!

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That was wonderful!

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Suddenly, it's a good song.

411
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's a good song.

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a good song.

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's a good song.

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Then,

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I wonder if Kosugi-kun can sing this song.

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Kosugi!

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll sing a song about a bride waiting for her husband's return.

418
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You saw it, didn't you? The one that I failed earlier.

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You saw it, didn't you? The one that I failed earlier.

420
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It was a bad one.

421
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It was.

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I won't do such a simple thing again.

423
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There are many types of Garuna, so I'm just choosing.

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's right.

425
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm just doing it with my body.

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The laces you gave me are wet today too.

427
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The laces you gave me are not dry today too.

428
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Go-Ka!

429
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That was wonderful!

430
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Kozue-kun was wonderful.

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I see.

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Kozue-kun is tough.

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay, please.

434
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That was perfect.

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That was good.

436
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Next week, we'll be looking at the children's show, the new regular member audition.

437
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Black Mayonnaise Tutorial

438
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Kirin is facing a new challenge

439
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Can the 3rd round overcome the pressure they've never experienced before?

440
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's perfect

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's good

442
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Among the 3 teams that have shown countless miracles and unexpected performances, who will be the ones to pass?

443
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And after the audition, the 6 members will be faced with a new trap by Dues Hamada.

444
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Don't miss the shocking ending!

445
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
