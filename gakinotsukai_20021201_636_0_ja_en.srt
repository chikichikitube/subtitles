1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Excuse me

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yamasaki san said, if you can come, then come

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No, I can't come

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What do you mean?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you mean?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't understand

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you can come, then come

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you can come, then come

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, no, no

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I was there earlier

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you can come here, then come.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You want to see it?

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Outside?

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, outside.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What is it?

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Excuse me, please come this way.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is a domino.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, no, no.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I knew it.

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, no, no.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Excuse me, please come this way.

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What?

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Please.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What?

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,160
What's this?

32
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,240
Still holding a acorn...

33
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,380
Ш Sheikh!

34
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,520
Well…"

35
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,220
Here's the key to your luck

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,200
writer

37
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,280
In this MYSTERY WORLD

38
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:03,260
There's a lot of

39
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,920
equipment

40
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,900
A ring that imitates acorns

41
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,540
once I am here

42
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,680
MANIFFICIENT

43
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,900
like because I'm the king of the azure eye

44
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,860
You punk

45
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,660
Bring this four weeks toes

46
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:22,660
If you find it, I will give you a wonderful treasure.

47
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,660
However, in order to know if this gold gold coin exists, I have to solve the mystery I thought of.

48
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Can you solve my mystery with your wisdom?

49
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Then I will give you the first hint.

50
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:49,660
Now, please bring out the goddesses of fortune.

51
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,660
Now, please bring out the goddesses of fortune.

52
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
You idiot.

53
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
Ah, I missed. Ah, it's a coin.

54
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
It's not on the coin.

55
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
It's not on the coin.

56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,660
So what should I do?

57
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,660
I should find the goddess of fortune.

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,660
I wonder if it's gold or four pieces.

59
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
It's a children's show.

60
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
This is a big place.

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
I was told to look for it here.

62
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
Something like that.

63
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Clearly.

64
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,660
What's that?

65
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Is that a goddess?

66
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Yes, it is.

67
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,660
What's that?

68
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,660
That's a first class machine.

69
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
It's a first class machine.

70
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,660
It's a first class machine for kids.

71
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,660
Is this a goddess?

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,660
It's a goddess.

73
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
Is it a goddess?

74
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:05,660
It's a special thing that you can see from a vehicle.

75
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,660
The puzzle that can be seen from the vehicle is called Tokubesshi.

76
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Tokubesshi, I see.

77
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,660
Toku is Tokubesshi.

78
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,660
Is it over there?

79
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Over here?

80
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Why is it a B-bock?

81
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,660
This is also a smoke.

82
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
Then, Endo, go!

83
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Everyone?

84
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
Everyone?

85
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,660
I don't like it!

86
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,660
This is pretty scary.

87
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Wait a minute!

88
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,660
No, no, no, no, no.

89
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,660
So what kind of movement is it?

90
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
There's something!

91
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
It's pretty scary!

92
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
There it is!

93
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Good luck!

94
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
It's a red one!

95
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,660
What is this?

96
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
What is this?

97
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
It's coming forward!

98
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
Come on, come on!

99
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,660
I don't know.

100
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
I don't know.

101
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,660
Please be careful with your hands.

102
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
Thank you very much.

103
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
The last one is the last one, right?

104
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
I don't know anything.

105
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,660
The first one is probably like a karaoke.

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Karaoke?

107
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
Honestly, the two in the middle didn't see it.

108
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
I haven't seen it either.

109
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Hamada.

110
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
I can't see it.

111
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
You didn't see it at all.

112
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
I saw it.

113
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
Why should I go?

114
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,660
I saw it.

115
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
I asked.

116
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
To be honest, this is the second time.

117
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
It's a very cut candidate.

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,660
I saw the same picture twice.

119
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
I got it.

120
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,660
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
It's okay if you do it.

123
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
You're a weird kid.

124
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660
No, no, no.

125
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,660
I can't use this.

126
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Look at this.

127
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Look at this.

128
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Look at this.

129
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,660
Look at this.

130
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Did you see?

131
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Did you see?

132
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
I didn't see anything.

133
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
I didn't see anything.

134
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
I didn't see anything.

135
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
A toothbrush and a pencil.

136
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
A toothbrush and a pencil.

137
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,660
A fire bug?

138
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
No, it's a tower!

139
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
A beetle!

140
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
A tower?

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
A chimney!

142
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
A chimney!

143
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
It's a chimney!

144
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
A chimney!

145
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
A beetle?

146
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
It's a beetle, right?

147
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
The word that came out is...

148
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,660
If you think of a beetle, there's the next command, right?

149
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
It's a beetle, right?

150
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,660
What the hell is this?

151
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,660
A beetle? I think there's a beetle in the ride.

152
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
That's definitely not it.

153
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
A flying beetle.

154
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
There's no doubt about it.

155
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
There might be a gold coin.

156
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
There's nothing here.

157
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,660
Hey! What's this?

158
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
What's this white thing?

159
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,660
I think it's a part of the gold coin.

160
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,660
This is the worst child's story.

161
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
I see.

162
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
It's a gold coin.

163
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Really?

164
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,660
I think it's a gold coin.

165
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
It's a coin.

166
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
It's a coin.

167
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Here it comes.

168
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Gentlemen, you understand very well.

169
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,660
I have been working for Mr. Dilber for 25 years.

170
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
I am not a brah.

171
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,660
But the second gold coin is not that easy to get.

172
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,660
Then, I will give you the next scene.

173
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:04,660
I have a big hero who was buried in the ground in his villa.

174
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Please eat the western food.

175
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:17,660
It's about time for your soup, so I'll be around here.

176
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Good, good, good, good, good.

177
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
What is this?

178
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
What is this?

179
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,660
I don't feel like talking about this.

180
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
What is this?

181
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,660
Eat the sacred food that the great hero who will rule the earth has.

182
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Eat?

183
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
What is this?

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Is it sold somewhere?

185
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm not sure.

186
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
What?

188
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
I'm sorry.

190
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Do you eat this?

191
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
Is there anything to put on it?

192
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
You can eat it.

193
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
There's nothing.

194
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
You can put ketchup on it.

195
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
You can put it on it.

196
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
You can eat it.

197
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
You can eat it.

198
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
There's a lot of them.

199
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
What should I do with this?

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
You should eat it.

201
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Say it.

202
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Say it when you're not supposed to.

203
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Say it when you're not supposed to.

204
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
There's definitely nothing in this.

205
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,660
You ate it all.

206
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,160
Ah!

207
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Ahhhh!

208
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
I'm gonna eat this.

209
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
What's the meaning of this?

210
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,660
When you show your courage, you'll know what's gold or not.

211
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
What's this?

212
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
This is for Hamada-san.

213
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Hamada-san's courage is being tested.

214
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Can I leave this?

215
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Eat it all.

216
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Why are you so fair?

217
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
This is dangerous.

218
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
This is not good.

219
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
This is bad.

220
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
This is bad.

221
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Wait a minute. This is bad.

222
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Why are we standing still?

223
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,660
It's time to show your courage.

224
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
It's really me.

225
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
It's Hamada-san.

226
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
It's big.

227
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
This is...

228
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
This is the senior and junior.

229
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
This is the senior.

230
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Hamada-san.

231
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Help me!

232
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Hamada-san.

233
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
This is Hamada-san!

234
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Hamada-san, you're the best!

235
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Wow, it's so high!

236
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
I want to kill Hamada right now.

237
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
What are you talking about?

238
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
The next day

239
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
How was it?

240
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
He's crying

241
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Unfortunately, I've never been in trouble

242
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
I hope you eat it

243
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
There's something

244
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
It's like going to the men's toilet

245
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
I see

246
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
There it is

247
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
I think it's the same

248
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Oh, it's true!

249
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Ouch!

250
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
It's done!

251
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Oh my god!

252
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Why is this one sticking out?

253
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,660
This is a very dangerous thing to do.

254
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Why is it in the toilet?

255
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
It's good.

256
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Let's open the box and the one with the most.

257
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Ready, set...

258
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
This one!

259
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
This one, right?

260
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Let's open it!

261
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
What is this?

262
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
You're so scary.

263
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
It's still the same.

264
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
What is this?

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
You opened the box, didn't you?

266
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
You got caught.

267
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Then, open this one.

268
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
But, it's open.

269
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Oh, oh, oh!

270
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
It's a second one.

271
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
It's easy.

272
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
I just left it there.

273
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,660
I'm so heavy!

274
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,660
Then just leave it here.

275
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
Let's find something.

276
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Shoo! Shoo!

277
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
Oh, another one.

278
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Here it comes.

279
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Hi!

280
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Are you surprised?

281
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,660
You can't open the surprise box.

282
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
My name is Audrey.

283
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,660
I'm working for Mr. Gilbert.

284
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Because Mr. Gilbert is a cutie.

285
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Well, your adventure continues.

286
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,660
When you go down the slope of hope, an angel will appear.

287
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Oh no, it's already this late. I have to hurry.

288
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,660
Alright, see you later.

289
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
The angel of hope?

290
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:19,660
It's a good thing that the weather is nice today, but it's not good to be shaken even by a child.

291
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Please read this.

292
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,660
What?

293
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
I kicked it.

294
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,660
I'll tell you a great secret, so wait in front of the nearby public telephone.

295
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
I wrote something.

296
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Call me?

297
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
It says, call me.

298
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
Hello?

299
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Hello?

300
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,660
It's the GAL from before. Did you call me?

301
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Yes, I did.

302
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You're lying.

303
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
What a shame.

304
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,660
I'm the phantom thief, Jiruba.

305
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,660
I'll teach you the secret of the gold gold coin.

306
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Yes.

307
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,660
Go in the direction of the arrow.

308
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,660
Go in the direction of the arrow.

309
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Hello?

310
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,660
Yamazaki?

311
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,660
It's a phantom thief.

312
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,660
He's a phantom thief.

313
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,660
Why does he want to write down the arrow and give us the gold coin?

314
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
This is the one, right?

315
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Ah, this is it!

316
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
It's a go-kart!

317
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,660
It's a go-kart that's divided into two people in a van.

318
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,660
We don't know what a van is.

319
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
That's true.

320
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
It's a ride-or-die thing.

321
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Let's go!

322
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,660
What are you doing?

323
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,660
What's the point of riding that?

324
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
This is it! It's Jiruba!

325
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
You've been caught again, guys.

326
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,660
I am Jiruba's eternal rival, the 100-point clock!

327
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,660
I have many traps, so be careful!

328
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,660
I also 20 years ago, in West River,

329
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,660
I was bitten by a white crocodile and died!

330
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Please be careful!

331
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Then, tell me where the next gold gold coin is!

332
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,460
Why are you laughing?

333
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
You dirty Ero brothers!

334
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,460
You two will explore the mansion where the monster's hair grows

335
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,460
and take the gold gold from the king of terror.

336
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
I pray for your safety.

337
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Who is the dirty Ero brothers?

338
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Ah, me and...

339
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,960
Eh?

340
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,460
Oh, you two are going to join us?

341
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
Again?

342
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,460
Ah, this combination?

343
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,460
Yes, yes.

344
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,460
I'm sure you'll be surprised.

345
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,460
Then, Chibiero Brothers.

346
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Do your best, Chibiero Brothers.

347
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
I'll get the gold.

348
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
I'm counting on you.

349
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I'll get it.

350
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm gonna die if you don't move.

351
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
Nothing came out.

352
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
I can't see anything in the circle.

353
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Nothing came out yet.

354
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
It's a goldfish.

355
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,460
Scary, scary, scary, scary.

356
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Something's coming.

357
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Ahhhh!

358
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,460
It's a big surprise.

359
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Don't do that.

360
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Scary!

361
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
You're not breaking the screen at all.

362
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
I'm with Hamasato!

363
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
I'm scared!

364
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
Ahhhh!

365
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I'm a cameraman!

366
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
It's not funny.

367
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Why?

368
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
I'm done!

369
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,460
What?

370
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
I'm scared by myself.

371
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,460
What?

372
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
I'm scared.

373
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
I'm scared.

374
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Please help me.

375
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,460
Heibo, shut up.

376
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
Shut up, Heibo.

377
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
Heibo is the scariest.

378
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
Heibo, go forward.

379
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
What is this?

380
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
What is this?

381
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
No.

382
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Heibo, shut up.

383
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
It's not funny.

384
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Hey, it's so small.

385
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
What are you doing?

386
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Wait, wait.

387
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
You were on it?

388
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
In that place.

389
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,460
Oh, there's a monitor.

390
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,460
Yes.

391
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I didn't notice at all.

392
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

393
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
How was it?

394
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,460
It was a refreshing experience, wasn't it?

395
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
What is this?

396
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Even so, you have already obtained three gold coins, haven't you?

397
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Who is this?

398
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Well, what is this?

399
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Lastly, please find Tama-chan's friend and obtain the gold coins there.

400
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
You, the Chakre Brothers...

401
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,460
Chakre Brothers?

402
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
You should go there!

403
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
I've already been asked to do this!

404
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
This will be your last adventure.

405
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
What?

406
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,460
Tama-chan's...

407
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,460
Tama-chan's...

408
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Hey, come out!

409
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
I'm done with this!

410
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
I saw something.

411
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Tama-chan's...

412
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
What's with Tama-chan's?

413
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
My friend was looking at me.

414
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
It's your last adventure, right?

415
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,460
I think something's burning.

416
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
I don't know if I can do it.

417
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
The size is different, so it's not that hard.

418
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
It's stuck.

419
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
These guys are from the road.

420
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Look at this.

421
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Look at this.

422
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
It's a hamster.

423
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
You're hiding it all the time.

424
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Hamster.

425
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Ah, Tama-chan.

426
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Ah, Tama-chan.

427
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,460
I'm looking for Tama-chan's friend.

428
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,460
That's why I'm looking for a new type.

429
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Ah, a new type.

430
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
Ah, this is Ashika.

431
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Ah, there's something.

432
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,460
I'm going to put it on the bottom.

433
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
It's a medal.

434
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
Ah, a medal!

435
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Did you get it? That one!

436
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
It's a medal.

437
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
The last one.

438
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
If you get close, you can get it.

439
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,460
But if you get close, you'll be like, pshhh.

440
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,460
That's amazing.

441
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
I'll start.

442
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Ah, it's already hot.

443
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I can't catch it.

444
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Tanaka, catch it.

445
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,460
I'm going to push.

446
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
I knew it.

447
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
It's so easy.

448
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
I caught it.

449
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Kaito, Zilber, Foo...

450
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
I got it.

451
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
It's not as easy as I thought.

452
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Is it Zilber?

453
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Zilber.

454
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
Congratulations.

455
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,460
You've finally found the 4 gold coins.

456
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Now, with the 4 gold coins, we'll go down the hill of fate.

457
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
We are also humans.

458
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Behind the door, there are treasures waiting for us.

459
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,460
Waiting for us?

460
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,460
We'll be happier than you guys.

461
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,420
I'm waiting for you to read the

462
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
The treasure is waiting.

463
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,420
The treasure is waiting.

464
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
There is something to be angry.

465
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
Oh, that's it.

466
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
There is such a place.

467
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Oh, look.

468
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
It fits here.

469
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
It fits.

470
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
The last one.

471
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
The last fight.

472
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Do you know what it is?

473
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
It came.

474
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
I don't know who's crying when I say it's in.

475
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
It's in!

476
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Look, it's out!

477
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
It's a key.

478
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
The key came out.

479
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Ah, that key!

480
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
You said it's in, so you took it out.

481
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
That's right.

482
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Thank you.

483
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
It's in.

484
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Here we go.

485
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Yes.

486
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
End.

487
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
Here we go.

488
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
Yes.

489
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
End.

490
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Ah, I see.

491
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
So you want me to sit down?

492
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Yes, you can sit down.

493
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
Let's see.

494
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Let's see.

495
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Let's go.

496
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,420
The opening.

497
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Everyone, let's go!

498
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
1,2,3!

499
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm in love with your throat-colored cheeks

500
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm staring at your machined line

501
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,420
If we look at each other with a sparkling look

502
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
My heart will go crazy

503
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm in love with your throat-colored cheeks

504
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
It's too fast!

505
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
It's a little too fast, isn't it?

506
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Aga-sen is here.

507
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Aga-sen is here.

508
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
Yeah!

509
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,420
I want to start with a one-sided love.

510
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I want to love you so much that I don't know what I don't know.

511
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I don't remember.

512
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Ah, I can't go back to that person

513
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:36,420
I can't go back to my lover

514
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,420
I can't go back to my dreams

515
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,420
I can't go back to my dreams

516
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
I don't know.

517
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
I don't know the lyrics.

518
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I don't know.

519
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,420
I don't know.

520
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,420
This is almost a full chorus.

521
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,420
I thought it was a foreign singer, but it's been a while.

522
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Ah, it's over.

523
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
I'm hungry.

524
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Hello.

525
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
What?

526
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
What is this?

527
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Yama-chan wanted to do this.

528
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,420
I wanted to show this to you.

529
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
I'll leave it to you.
