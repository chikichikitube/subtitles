1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Happy Birthday to you!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This week's birthday song is Matsumoto's 54th Birthday Song

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Matsumoto's 54th birthday is celebrated with the original birthday song that the members have written

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Do you remember? After the recording

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Light shines on the dark world

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Tonight

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You were born

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In addition to the unthinkable Marufigesuto

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The partner Hamada will also sing

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I hate shining things

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to go out

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Excuse me

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Welcome

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Happy birthday, Mr. Akimoto

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you very much, Momiji-san.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Momiji-san, thank you very much.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Today, you're wearing a beautiful kimono.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Kitty-chan...

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Kitty-chan.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I like Kitty-chan, so I'd like you to remember her.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, let's do it again.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Happy birthday.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you for coming all the way here.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was happy to celebrate it.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was surprised.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When Matsumoto-san held a meeting for various projects,

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
she often said about Momiji-san.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I often said that I wanted to include Momiji-san.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm very happy.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm very happy.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
When I was watching Matsumoto-san's appearance on TV,

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I thought it was not interesting anymore.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I was so happy to see the video of the song that I asked her to wear a pink kimono.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was on the program that I was not on.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What is good about Momiji?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Momiji has a great balance.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She is an actress, so she can talk.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If she is in need, she can also laugh.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I see.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a high rating.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so happy.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
She sometimes uses the topic of the burdock.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I see.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The number of people who have experienced the Omamichi.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's what I saw.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's the way Monbi uses it.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm very happy that you use it to this extent.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I see.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm very happy.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's strange to be told to stop doing that.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's normal.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a big heart.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not good at all.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I wasn't here

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're acting like a father

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Huh?

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The reason why I'm being called to this variety show is because of you, Mr. Matsumoto

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm really grateful that you're able to talk about me, an actress who's not funny at all

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, there are a little more than 70 people with experience.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Even though Matsumoto-san is such a great person,

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
when I go to greet him at the dressing room,

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
even during lunch, he would wake up properly

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and come to the place where I breathe,

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
saying, I don't mind,

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and he would accept my precious souvenir.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I really like Matsumoto-san

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The lovely lady you talk to

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Every time I hear about happiness

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I noticed, I noticed

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm secretly in love with the princess

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to be your daughter

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Matsumoto-san's daughter

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Happy Birthday!

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Even the lines are included.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Please continue with the song.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, she wrote a message.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's wonderful.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When I heard the chorus, I thought, is he my father?

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's like, if you weren't here, you wouldn't be here.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's like I was born here, so I'll put it on the variety show.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a very meaningful story.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's the father of the world's best actor.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I thought he was the father of the world's best actor.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He hasn't been on a variety show yet.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was nervous because I was going to be on a variety show.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I was a little bit dumbfounded, but I was so nervous.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't know if I could say it.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was so happy that everyone was able to say it.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm really grateful for that.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are the mother of a child, right?

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,500
Yes.

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
So you are the mother of a child?

103
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
Dad!

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Dad?

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
Today, I am a mother.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you very much.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You want to be a daughter, right?

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I was jealous.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
When I was talking about you,

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you made a very good movie.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Really?

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I should stop talking about my daughter?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But it was fun to hear.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,500
I love the movie that Masumoto-san's heart is already overflowing.

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
But we got to know about it.

117
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
We got to know about it.

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Because it's written in such a private room.

119
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Yes.

120
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
It's amazing.

121
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Thank you very much.

122
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
It's good. It's good.

123
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Thank you very much.

124
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
It's good for us only?

125
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
That's right.

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
It's a surprise.

127
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
You have been on the show once in a while, right?

128
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Yes, we do.

129
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
You have been doing a lot of things.

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
That's right.

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I have been doing it with Akemi-chan.

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
That's right.

133
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
That's right.

134
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Yes.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
That's right.

136
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Kyoko-chan, you came here on purpose?

137
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
That's right.

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
You got a trap.

139
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Matsumoto-san, happy birthday!

140
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
No, no, no, thank you very much!

141
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Here you go!

142
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Thank you very much!

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Thank you very much!

144
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Thank you very much!

145
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Good evening!

146
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm always a big fan of yours.

147
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Thank you very much!

148
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
I'll always support you!

149
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm so happy!

150
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Happy birthday!

151
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Your lipstick is beautiful today.

153
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
You have it on your lips.

154
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm not used to it.

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
But recently, I've gotten better at makeup.

156
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Thank you.

157
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
You've become more and more feminine.

158
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I'm very happy.

159
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Thank you for coming to this celebration.

160
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Thank you for coming.

161
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm so excited.

162
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Really? I'm so happy.

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Is there a private party?

164
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
No, there isn't.

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Is this your first time?

166
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
No, it's not.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
It's not that.

168
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,500
The first time I saw you...

169
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Legendary entertainer...

170
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
It's a little bit creepy to say it here.

171
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
A serious man without energy.

172
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
We have to do the show together!

173
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
How about it?

174
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Sunday, the 24th, 11pm!

175
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Matsumoto's 54th Birthday Party

176
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I'm so happy

177
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Is it a private party?

178
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
No, it's not a private party

179
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
It's not a private party

180
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,940
a rendition of her 3rd album,

181
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,100
once Pure F Stay

182
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:59,220
when I saw for the first time

183
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,760
that time when I was able to meet

184
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,260
my dream was

185
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,620
when I was still October

186
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,620
20 years have passed since then

187
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,620
The first meeting of my dreams

188
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:38,620
My heart is pounding with happiness

189
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,620
I like the way you look, your hair, your fashion

190
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:58,620
Your big smile, your shy smile, your shy gestures

191
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,620
I like everything about you

192
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:11,620
I love all of your shy gestures

193
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,620
From now on, forever and ever

194
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Please stay as you are, Matsumoto-san

195
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:38,620
I will love you forever and ever and ever and ever

196
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,620
I love you

197
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Wonderful!

198
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,620
The harmony was amazing!

199
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,620
She was on the show.

200
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
She was on the show.

201
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
She was on the show.

202
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,620
I was very nervous today.

203
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,620
How was it, Kuroko?

204
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,620
You have a good body.

205
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,620
Yes.

206
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
How was it?

207
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,620
I was saying that at the training gym,

208
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
the people who train with me,

209
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,620
they train Matsumoto's pectoral muscles.

210
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,620
I heard that you were wondering how much you would raise the bench press.

211
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,620
I'm happy to hear that.

212
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Thank you very much.

213
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Thank you very much.

214
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,620
I feel so good.

215
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
I've been watching TV for a long time.

216
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:47,620
I'm glad to hear the surprise from people who are not regular people.

217
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,620
He usually does things that are very tense.

218
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
That's right.

219
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,620
He's a world champion.

220
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,620
When he sings, he gets a little nervous.

221
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
That's right.

222
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,620
If he's moving during a wrestling match, he can get a sense of tension.

223
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,620
But he can't move, so he's using the microphone.

224
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,620
But I was going to celebrate with all my might, so thank you.

225
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,620
Thank you.

226
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,620
I hate those who are envious.

227
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,620
I love those who don't call me Papa.

228
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Matsumoto's 54th Birthday Celebration.

229
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,620
The last song is sung by Hamada.

230
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,620
I love the training of my muscles around me

231
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,620
I hate cold water

232
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,620
More than anything, I love to laugh

233
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,620
I met you when I was six years old

234
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,620
I realized I was already 54 years old

235
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,620
I met her when I was 6 years old

236
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,620
I realized I was already 54 years old

237
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Human poison is a poison

238
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Human poison is a poison

239
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Human poison is a poison

240
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:20,360
but even then, it was you who sang with me

241
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Thank you.

242
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,360
He is the one who gives us all the things we like and hate.

243
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
And he is old.

244
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
He is young.

245
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
He has to take good care of himself.

246
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
He is 6 years old.

247
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
He is coming to Japan at 54.

248
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
That's great.

249
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
He is 48.

250
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
He is half a century old in 2 years.

251
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
He is older than anyone.

252
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Well, I guess I'm closer to him than anyone else.

253
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
That's right.

254
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
He often says that I'm a human being.

255
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
But what do you all think? Do you think it's better to say it?

256
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Should we say it?

257
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Should we say it?

258
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Really?

259
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm nervous.

260
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Are you really nervous?

261
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
If you don't say it, you'll be more nervous.

262
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
At that time, I was alone at night and said,

263
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's dangerous!

264
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
The special episode of the kid's world!

265
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,360
A special episode of what you want to ask a legend entertainer!

266
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,360
A real talk show without any MGs!

267
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Everything you want to ask a popular entertainer!

268
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,360
If you say Tunnels here, it's a little bit creepy.

269
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Downtown talks about Tunnels!

270
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
And Matsumoto challenges the electric press!

271
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
He tries to wash it down!

272
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
That's all for today!

273
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Sunday, the 24th, 11pm!

274
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,360
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who says,

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,360
What happens if you take all the L.O.V.D. from Hamada-san?

276
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
You shouldn't ask such a big question.

277
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,360
All the questions are on the website.

278
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Oh, so you like hot stuff.

279
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't think it's as much as it used to be.

280
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Of course it is.

281
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
You too, Yajiro-san.

282
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
I'm getting less and less.

283
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,360
You used to have a counter with this much stuff, right?

284
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Not really, but I used to buy 3 or 4 of those.

285
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Not anymore.

286
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,360
I did throw away quite a lot of them.

287
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Before I threw them away, I had this kind of thing.

288
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
It's like a pata-pata album.

289
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I put a lot of DVDs in it.

290
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
You've kept them properly.

291
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
I've kept them.

292
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,360
I put the ones I was worried about throwing away in the back.

293
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
The ones I was thinking about.

294
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,360
I just happened to be in a bad mood at that time.

295
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Sometimes I want to see something.

296
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,360
I thought I'd take a look at the one I was looking back on in the past.

297
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,360
If I can't do this, I'll throw it away.

298
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,360
When I saw it, it was surprisingly right.

299
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
It's dangerous.

300
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
It's dangerous.

301
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,360
At that time, at night, I was like, it's dangerous!

302
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I understand that.

303
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
While blowing.

304
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
While blowing.

305
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
What are you doing?

306
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
He's a fool.

307
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
You're a fool.

308
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,360
If you take it off, it'll be like a table.

309
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
That's not true.

310
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I think so.

311
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,360
But in your case, it's not a commercial product.

312
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,360
We sell it at a store.

313
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I also sell it at a store.

314
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Again, again, again.

315
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
That's enough.

316
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Is there a product that is not sold at a store?

317
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,860
So, your collection is mostly self-made, right?

318
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
You're crazy.

319
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I'm serious.

320
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm serious.

321
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
You're crazy.

322
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm serious.

323
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
What do you mean self-made?

324
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,860
You've done it before, right?

325
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,360
I haven't.

326
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Really?

327
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
No, I misunderstood.

328
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I heard that you are doing it.

329
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
What kind of misunderstanding is that?

330
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,360
So, if you take it up, it's not like you can take it up.

331
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
You are making it.

332
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
You are making it.

333
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Every month, you are being imported.

334
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
That...

335
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
In-port...

336
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
So, I heard that you have a great screen.

337
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Oh, I don't have it.

338
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
What?

339
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I heard that you have an AV room there.

340
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
It's a bit confusing to say AV or AV, but...

341
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Yes, yes, yes.

342
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
But the real AV...

343
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Ah, no, not at all.

344
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
What?

345
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
It's a normal TV.

346
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I heard that.

347
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,360
No, it's not like that. Someone said it, just randomly.

348
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
How many are there in the collection?

349
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
How many?

350
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Yes.

351
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,360
To be honest, I have about 20.

352
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
I don't have 20, but...

353
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
How many are there?

354
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
I don't know.

355
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
No, no, no.

356
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
That's also...

357
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I know.

358
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
I know.

359
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
I know.

360
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Then throw it away.

361
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Where are you throwing it?

362
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Where are you throwing it?

363
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Where should I throw it?

364
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Don't say it like a corpse.

365
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Does your wife know about that?

366
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
She probably knows.

367
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Oh, that's the gray one.

368
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
So you can't look at your wife and say,

369
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
What is this?

370
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
No, I don't look at her.

371
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I just put her in my room.

372
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
You're saying,

373
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Let's spend this together!

374
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
That's weird!

375
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
That's weird!

376
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Once, I got a call from my wife while I was working.

377
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I said, I'm sorry.

378
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
My wife is that kind of person.

379
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
She's the type to say, I'm sorry.

380
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
The living room deck was broken.

381
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
I wanted to watch the DVD, so I thought I'd watch it in my room's deck.

382
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,360
But a weird thing came out of the tray.

383
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
That thing is printed now.

384
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Like a photo?

385
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
A photo.

386
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
I said, I'm sorry, I saw that.

387
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
I got a call while I was working.

388
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,360
It's not good to say that.

389
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
What?

390
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,360
I don't know if I should say that or say that I don't write anything else.

391
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
What did you do at that time?

392
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Well...

393
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Well, it's not more than this.

394
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Well, I wasn't told not to use it.

395
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I didn't expect it.

396
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I didn't expect it.

397
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I didn't expect it.

398
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Well, that's what it is.

399
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
That's a little bit.

400
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Shall we go home?

401
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,360
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360
I'm glad it's the last time.

403
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
I'm not saying anything bad.

404
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I'm saying that I'm healthy.

405
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm not even exaggerating.

406
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,360
We used to talk about lotion.

407
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Lotion? What's lotion?

408
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Moisturizing?

409
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I used to say, when I do it myself, I use lotion and stuff.

410
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
I don't use that anymore.

411
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Ah, but you do use lotion.

412
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
I do use it!

413
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
What?!

414
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I don't use it!

415
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
You don't use it.

416
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
I used to put lotion in my bag while I was moving.

417
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
That was a long time ago, right?

418
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Long time ago.

419
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,360
When I moved to the second back, I put a bottle in there.

420
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,360
I went back to the hotel and I saw him with a lid on.

421
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,360
His second bag was all wet.

422
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
What should I do? I had no choice but to throw it away.

423
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
No, no, I just put my hand in it.

424
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
You put it in?

425
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
I thought he put it in his bag for a moment.

426
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Thank you.
