1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,375
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,417
Today's first segment is...

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,876
Ganbareruya's
Fighting Spirit Series.

4
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:14,167
They're given difficult tasks
like cheerleading and rock climbing,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,876
Ganbareruya will overcome them
with their fighting spirit.

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,083
The task they'll do this time is...

7
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:22,709
What's this?

8
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:29,792
Rhythmic gymnastics?

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,125
That's right, the task this time
is rhythmic gymnastics,

10
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,667
where they'll dance like fairies
while using various apparatuses.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,209
I'm so happy, hurray! I'm happy!
 Hurray!

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,876
In fact,
Ganbareruya had been wanting

13
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,125
to do rhythmic gymnastics
eagerly in this series.

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,667
This time, for the ladies
who won't give up no matter what,

15
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,209
we'll be prepared to shelf it
when we do this.

16
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,542
Is there any concern?

17
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,876
We're flexible.
 I see.

18
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,083
If I must say,

19
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:04,751
I think I gained a bit of weight,

20
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,083
but I can do it.

21
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:09,709
What's the matter?

22
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:11,959
I can do it!

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,125
I can do this.

24
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,626
Wow, impressive!

25
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,918
Impressive!

26
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:22,751
How good can they get in one week?

27
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,667
Welcome to The Quest.

28
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:35,500
Tonight, it's Ganbareruya's
Fighting Spirit Series

29
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:39,417
and the third Wazuma Tetsuro.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,417
Wasshoi!

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,459
"Morisanchu"

32
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,459
Hello...

33
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,459
Hello.

34
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:44,459
Hello.

35
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:45,667
V!

36
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,250
Okay, it's Ganbareruya's
Fighting Spirit Series.

37
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:50,209
It's rhythmic gymnastics.
 Yes.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,792
Fairy Japan did very well
at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

39
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:58,751
The Fairies of The Quest,
Ganbareruya,

40
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,626
this time...
 Hang on.

41
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:01,834
What did you just say?

42
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,667
The Fairies of The Quest

43
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,167
Nobody calls you that!

44
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,292
What?
 Don't "what" me.

45
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:08,751
Huh?

46
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,375
What the heck?

47
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,709
Can I watch it
like watching Fairy Japan?

48
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:13,918
Please do.

49
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,667
You can score our performance
if you like.

50
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,292
You're confident in yourselves.

51
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,876
Sure. Please do that.

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,042
You're heavy.

53
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,876
Heavy? Look who's talking.

54
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,709
Her knees will give in.
 Let's come down.

55
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,751
"Ganbareruya's
Fighting Spirit Project"

56
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:33,542
I'm sorry.
 It's okay.

57
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,751
Are you stupid?
 She pisses me off!

58
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:39,834
"Clumsy old man
takes up the challenge"

59
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,542
Already?

60
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,542
45 minutes from Shiodome by car,
 It's so close.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,334
Ganbareruya's
Fighting Spirit Series.

62
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,584
It's in Tokyo?

63
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:52,042
How good can they get
in rhythmic gymnastics in a week?

64
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,876
In Tokyo.

65
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,125
They've come
to Kunitachi City, Tokyo,

66
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,542
to Tokyo Women's College
of Physical Education.

67
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:00,876
Excuse me.

68
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,125
They're students
of the rhythmic gymnastics club,

69
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,250
who will be helping us this time.

70
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,417
Nice to meet you...

71
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,959
They accepted
the unreasonable demand

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,250
of letting Ganbareruya join them.

73
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:15,500
Amazing.

74
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,083
Let's now ask them
to perform for us.

75
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,083
How do they spin?

76
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,125
Tokyo Women's College
of Physical Education

77
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,584
won 59 times out of 73

78
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,584
in the Japan National
Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship.

79
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:35,999
Many students of this powerhouse
also joined Fairy Japan.

80
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:39,083
They're all in great shape.
 They are.

81
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,334
They're so cool.

82
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,542
Rhythmic gymnastics
is usually performed individually

83
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,999
or in a group of five,

84
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:50,459
but this time, they'll perform
in a group of 21.

85
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,292
So cool.

86
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,083
Amazing!

87
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,334
It matches what we've been
wanting to do.

88
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:10,334
That was impressive.

89
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,083
I want to do all of them,
without leaving out any.

90
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:16,918
Yoshiko, are you as flexible?

91
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,834
Indeed, I am flexible.

92
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,999
Just a gross move.

93
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,417
They're so excited.

94
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:33,292
They'll be taught
by someone extraordinary,

95
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,876
Ms Erika Akiyama.

96
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:40,000
The way she stands
shows she was a gymnast.

97
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,751
Can I do this even if I'm heavy?

98
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:43,667
You can.

99
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,334
Machan's body is stiff.
 It's possible.

100
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,626
It's possible.

101
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,709
Let's start the practise right away.

102
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:54,626
There are five kinds of apparatus
in rhythmic gymnastics.

103
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,751
These are
the five kinds of apparatus.

104
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,500
This time, among them,

105
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:04,959
they'll use a ball, a hoop,
and a ribbon for the performance.

106
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,083
First, the ball.

107
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:11,459
I think the ball is the apparatus
you're most familiar with.

108
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,209
As shown, it's thrown up, caught,

109
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,667
and the performer
uses her body to roll the ball.

110
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,667
Impressive.

111
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,959
When you throw or manipulate it,

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,626
points are deducted if you grab it.

113
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,125
We can't grab it?
 Yes.

114
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,500
Let it stay on your body.
 What?

115
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,417
Wow, that's a difficult rule.

116
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:31,000
First, they'll practise throwing
the ball behind the back

117
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,751
and catch it from the front.

118
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,209
Go.

119
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,209
Yes. Well done, well done.

120
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,959
On the other hand, Yoshiko...

121
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,042
It looks easy at a glance,

122
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:47,751
but throwing the ball
to the aimed spot is very difficult.

123
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,500
That was good.

124
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,626
From the front...

125
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,834
Well done.
 Amazing.

126
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,667
Machan, I'm impressed.
How can you do that?

127
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:57,999
You're just clumsy.

128
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,834
She's suddenly harsh.

129
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,417
Next, it's ribbon.

130
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,918
Draw beautiful circles.

131
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:09,500
They'll try to do the shape
called spiral.

132
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,959
Make it look like there are about
four circles in midair.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
If the ribbon falls to the ground,

134
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,000
marks will be deducted.

135
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,417
Keep it above the floor
all the time.

136
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,375
But it's difficult when they try it.

137
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,834
It became some random shape...

138
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,375
On top of that...

139
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,250
Is there a knot?

140
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,209
If the movement is bad,
it ties a knot instantly.

141
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:36,417
In a competition, many marks
will be deducted if a knot is tied.

142
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,459
Lastly, it's the hoop.

143
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:40,500
Amazing.

144
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:43,584
When the hoop rolls here,
jump over it.

145
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,584
Let's try it, okay?

146
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,334
Mahiru goes first.

147
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:51,626
She's good at it.

148
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,334
Next, it's Yoshiko's turn.

149
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,417
Okay.

150
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,000
Sorry.

151
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,167
Watch out.

152
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,834
Where did you receive it?

153
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,042
Will marks be deducted
if I use my crotch to receive it?

154
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,250
I don't know.

155
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,292
On the first day of practise,

156
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,876
the two are painfully made aware
of how hard rhythmic gymnastics is.

157
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,500
Would you like us to go easy on you?

158
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,417
No.

159
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:15,375
I want you to think of it as
a performance in the Olympic Games.

160
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,500
I want you to watch it like watching
a performance by Fairy Japan.

161
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,792
Day two of practise.

162
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,083
What the heck?
 This is bad.

163
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,250
They'll practise with the students
starting today.

164
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,876
The students who will practise
together with Ganbareruya

165
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,792
are Succhan and Ayu.

166
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:35,083
They'll pack various techniques

167
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,792
into the 3.5minute performance
this time.

168
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,542
First, this is the technique
Mahiru will try.

169
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,167
After throwing the hoop,

170
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,542
she'll do a cartwheel
over someone and catch it.

171
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,709
One, two, three, four, five.

172
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,209
Okay...

173
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,459
Don't run away from it.
Keep your eyes on it.

174
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,709
It's scary.

175
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,417
Yoshiko will throw a ribbon
with her leg.

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,417
Incorporating a rotation skill
called Illusion,

177
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,459
she'll kick the ribbon up.

178
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,876
What's this?

179
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,375
How do you throw it?

180
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,459
I can't. I'm sorry.

181
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,999
Also, they'll do a combination skill
to exchange the ball.

182
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,709
They'll catch the ball facetoface
and bounce it on the back.

183
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,167
They bounce the ball this time?

184
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,584
What? I'm in a slump.

185
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,250
There is something
Yoshiko wants to do no matter what.

186
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,959
I'd like to do
an acrobatic technique.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,292
A front handspring.
 Yes.

188
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,834
Put your hands on the floor
and kick your legs forward.

189
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:42,167
Turn like this.

190
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:43,959
I want to do it.

191
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:47,834
That said,
this technique is too difficult,

192
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,542
so this time, she'll try
a front handspring with assistance.

193
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:52,500
I see.

194
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,334
But Yoshiko can't even do
the minimum requirement,

195
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,000
a handstand.

196
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:00,334
I can't do a handstand against
the wall because I'm scared.

197
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:03,876
So they will hold her up by force.

198
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,834
Wait...
 Hang in there...

199
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,209
It's heavy!

200
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:12,000
Wait, it's heavy! My body is heavy!

201
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,000
It's okay.

202
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,584
My body is heavy.

203
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,918
It's okay, it's okay.

204
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:16,999
Put me down.

205
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,209
It's okay.

206
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,626
I'm scared. I'm really scared!

207
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,000
To get rid of her fear,

208
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,959
she'll let her body get used
to how it feels.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,542
After one foot is on the floor...

210
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,834
There's no part of her
that looks like a fairy.

211
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,626
Oh, I see.

212
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,918
That's how you do it.

213
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,876
I don't know anymore.

214
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,292
While they're practising,

215
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,292
have a look at the video of the last
location we couldn't include.

216
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:51,918
They came

217
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:55,167
to a hotel that recreated the
stunning view in Santorini, Greece,

218
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,876
Villa Santorini.

219
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,792
The thing they did here was...

220
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,667
Mutual Trust Balance Challenge.

221
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:06,042
They pull each other in front
and behind in this position,

222
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:10,417
and it's successful
if they can balance in a V shape.

223
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,542
The V shape is what we do.

224
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,751
How can we not be able to do it?

225
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:15,792
But...

226
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,125
Aren't the back of your knees
sticking out?

227
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:23,751
Yeah, my knees stick out
at the back a bit.

228
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,083
You have your kneecaps
in front, right?

229
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,709
Mine are at the back.

230
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,417
Indeed.

231
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,876
My kneecaps are at the back.

232
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,709
Now, it's a quiz on Yoshiko's knees.

233
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:38,417
Is she laying down on her stomach
or her back?

234
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:40,542
Stomach?

235
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:41,709
On her stomach.

236
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:42,876
The correct answer is...

237
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,834
I'm lying on my back.

238
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,709
The people at the osteopathic clinic
were so surprised

239
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,834
that they took this photo
for reference.

240
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:55,375
Okay, let's do
the Mutual Trust Balance Challenge.

241
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,292
I'll stand. Ready, go.

242
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:58,626
And then...

243
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,000
Ready, go.

244
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,584
V!

245
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,792
But going back from here
is very difficult.

246
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:16,042
I was thinking, we'd fall
even if we do it successfully.

247
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,250
How are we supposed
to stand back up?

248
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,500
Next, they'll try
Doctor Fish on the Face.

249
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,083
I'm happy.

250
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,542
I've got a lot of dead skin
on my face.

251
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:30,918
Katsurahama Aquarium
helped us film this.

252
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,334
They can get rid of dead skin,

253
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,500
so it's very effective
if you have dead skin.

254
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,792
The fish will be delighted
and it's awesome for me.

255
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,709
This is a winwin relationship.

256
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,792
Mahiru tries it first.

257
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,083
They came close.

258
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,042
So cute.

259
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,000
Many come close.

260
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,083
The Doctor Fish go straight
to the feast that suddenly appeared.

261
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,709
Her nostrils...

262
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,542
Amazing.

263
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,292
It felt like they were kissing me.

264
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:04,500
It felt like a very deep
and passionate kiss.

265
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:08,834
Yoshiko is confident
she has old, dead skin.

266
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,042
They went there...

267
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,209
Many go to her chin.

268
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:19,083
The fish gather at her chin
for some reason,

269
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,999
but they aren't as eager
as expected.

270
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,667
How was it?

271
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:30,792
I wonder. Maybe it was few.
 Yeah?

272
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,375
Maybe it's rotten?

273
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,125
It isn't even food?

274
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,792
Day three of practise.

275
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,459
They rehearse to the music
for the performance starting today,

276
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,417
but the amount of exercise
for 3.5 minutes is unbelievable.

277
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,584
Of course.

278
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,125
It's tough.

279
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,709
It's tough.

280
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:56,500
Yoshiko also practises
how to do a front handspring.

281
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,709
Wait a minute.

282
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:00,626
She can't breathe.

283
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,209
Shall I bring you some oxygen?

284
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,083
Sorry, I lack oxygen.

285
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,709
Thanks.

286
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,626
The music is playing.

287
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,542
Almost.

288
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,751
Why don't you raise your legs
one by one, Yocchan?

289
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,167
Too much. Too much.

290
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,000
Raise your legs one by one.

291
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,999
Raise my legs one by one?

292
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,500
Want some?

293
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,250
Not oxygen again.

294
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:37,834
It's too much.

295
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,042
Day five of practise.

296
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,542
It's the regular morning stretching.

297
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:48,417
I'm sensitive to spirits.
Is this place haunted?

298
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,375
It is. If you touch the doll
in the storage room,

299
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:52,500
you'll get injured.

300
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:54,292
Ayu touched it and got injured.

301
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,626
My tendon tore.

302
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,959
Fear. The cursed doll passed down

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,375
to the Tokyo Women College
of Physical Education.

304
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,667
Can you see it from there?
 Yes.

305
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,042
It's the Japanese doll
among the two.

306
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,334
I'm scared.

307
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,709
I just felt a chill
run down my spine.

308
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,125
They go to look at it closely.

309
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,542
I'm scared.

310
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,125
I'm so scared.

311
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,959
At that time...

312
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,999
What?

313
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,792
Hey! Stop it!

314
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,876
It was you guys!

315
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,834
They became so close.

316
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,751
It was you!

317
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,542
Only you do things like that!

318
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,918
It's only you!

319
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,292
They're so close.

320
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,667
It was you!

321
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,292
Only you would do it!

322
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,209
Only you would do
something like that!

323
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,751
They've been practising like this
for five whole days.

324
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,375
They were total amateurs,

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,667
but it's starting to take shape
little by little.

326
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,626
Nice!

327
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,292
Nice!

328
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Impressive.
 Amazing.

329
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:04,959
That's it.

330
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,209
Amazing!

331
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:09,209
You did it three times in a row.

332
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,751
But there's no sign
of a successful handstand.

333
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,834
Yocchan...

334
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,375
Don't cry.

335
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,459
Don't cry.

336
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,167
You'll make me cry too.

337
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,167
You can do it.

338
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,334
Do your best.

339
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,876
You'll make me cry.

340
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,334
I feel so ashamed of myself.

342
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,083
Let's do our best.

343
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,876
Let your hands remember
how it feels.

344
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,999
Do this, then this.

345
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,209
Climb up.

346
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,500
Remember how this feels.

347
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,000
Her knees will give in.

348
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,125
Let's come down.

349
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:51,876
I'm sorry!

350
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,250
Hey!

351
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,375
Of all things,

352
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,792
Yoshiko farted directly
at the legend's face.

353
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,209
I'm sorry, Ms Akiyama.

354
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,250
It's okay.

355
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,542
They'll perform tomorrow,
come hell or high water.

356
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,459
Their bodies have reached
their limits long ago,

357
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:15,375
but they'll get in sync with
the rhythmic gymnastics teammates

358
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,792
and do the performance.

359
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,876
Everything is very difficult.

360
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:26,626
I have to throw the ball accurately
to where the other person is,

361
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,000
think about how I'm going to turn,

362
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,709
and throw the ball
precisely to where it lands.

363
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,292
When I think about it,
it's difficult to do.

364
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,417
Every part of my body hurts.

365
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:41,542
I stand on my toes on the mat
all the time, right?

366
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,959
So my calves are stiff,

367
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,751
and my back hurts.

368
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,209
Handling the ribbon
makes my arm hurt,

369
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,834
looking up makes my neck hurt.

370
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,959
My whole body is injured.

371
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,709
Even so, when the music plays,

372
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,876
they dance again and again.

373
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,792
I'll be happy

374
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:04,209
if you feel something
when you watch our performance.

375
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's do it, then.

376
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,918
Ganbareruya's rhythmic gymnastics
performance

377
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:12,459
with Tokyo Women's College
of Physical Education's

378
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,334
Rhythmic Gymnastics Club.

379
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,125
Their costumes are lovely.

380
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,417
Let's do it, then.

381
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,292
Ganbareruya's rhythmic gymnastics
performance

382
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,876
with Tokyo Women's College
of Physical Education's

383
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,792
Rhythmic Gymnastics Club.

384
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,584
Their costumes are lovely.

385
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,500
The makeup.
 Machan's makeup is heavy.

386
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,834
The performance starts
with using hoops.

387
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:44,999
So cool!

388
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:55,334
They perform the techniques while
keeping up with the quick tempo.

389
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,250
Oh, nice.

390
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,751
First, it's the highlight of Mahiru.

391
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:16,542
She catches the hoop after
a cartwheel over a performer.

392
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,834
She did it successfully.

393
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,167
She's calm.

394
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,167
Wow, impressive!

395
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,876
Then everyone dances in sync.

396
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:46,209
Mahiru throws a hoop,

397
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,667
and catches it facetoface.

398
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,000
Then it's Yoshiko's daring move,

399
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,918
a front handspring.

400
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,626
Amazing!

401
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,542
Now, they'll use the ball
in the performance.

402
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:08,334
It rolls away if they make the
smallest mistake while handling it,

403
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,999
the apparatus is difficult.

404
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,334
A backward roll
after catching the ball.

405
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,042
The fairy vibes
have suddenly vanished.

406
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,667
Mahiru does a cartwheel
over Yoshiko's spread legs.

407
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,375
From now on, their power
of expression explodes.

408
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,000
Well done.

409
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,459
Impressive.

410
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,626
Power of expression...

411
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:51,167
Then they exchange the ball.

412
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,542
They did it successfully.

413
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:55,667
And then...

414
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,751
bounce it on the back.

415
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,959
They finally use the last item
in the performance, a ribbon.

416
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,083
Beautiful.

417
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,000
A great exchange
by all the club members.

418
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,751
They're running out of stamina,

419
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,792
and they're dancing
by sheer fighting spirit.

420
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:21,959
You can do it.

421
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,999
Then an exchange of ribbons.

422
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,876
Good.

423
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,792
Finally, it's the climax
of the performance.

424
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,918
Yoshiko throws the ribbon
with her leg.

425
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,918
Mahiru throws three ribbons.

426
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,417
Okay!

427
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,459
Amazing!

428
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,083
Ganbareruya and

429
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:02,000
their friends from Tokyo Women's
College of Physical Education

430
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,667
have successfully finished
the performance.

431
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:09,500
Then when they reluctantly
say goodbye...

432
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,792
We enjoyed every single day
this week,

433
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,918
and we want to do more.

434
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,292
That's how we feel, right?
 Yeah.

435
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:23,626
We've dreamt of doing
rhythmic gymnastics.

436
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,959
Although it was only for a week,

437
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,751
we actually did it
and it makes us very happy.

438
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,500
We must thank you all.

439
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,792
Thank you for this week.

440
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,459
And...

441
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,709
She's more like a temple guardian
than a fairy.

442
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,876
I'm sorry...

443
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,500
You guys work hard every day.

444
00:21:56,584 --> 00:22:00,167
You could do more and more
every day,

445
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,167
it encouraged us to work harder,

446
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,209
and it also gave us power.

447
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:10,584
This week will be our treasure
for the rest of our lives,

448
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:14,042
and we will never forget it.

449
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,334
Thank you so much.

450
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,292
Students of Tokyo Women's College
of Physical Education,

451
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,792
thank you so much.

452
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:32,834
When the Captain said
the lovely words so emotionally,

453
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,584
I thought it'd make me cry,

454
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,125
but the look on Yoshiko's face
when she held back her tears

455
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,626
had too much impact on me.

456
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,876
You look like that
when you hold back your tears.

457
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,417
She looks like that
when she holds back tears.

458
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,542
I didn't want the younger girls
see me cry.

459
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:47,667
The girls all talked casually
to them halfway.

460
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,459
Exactly.

461
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,417
They played pranks on me
quite often.

462
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,417
They looked down on us.

463
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,209
Wazuma Tetsuro.

464
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:02,584
Magician Degawa,
the clumsiest man in Japan,

465
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:06,125
will try Wazuma, the traditional
Japanese magic in this project.

466
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,000
I see, here it comes.

467
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:09,542
Too late!

468
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:11,792
You must already know.

469
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:12,834
Know what?

470
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,083
Are you kidding me? You don't know?

471
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,459
Wazuma Tetsuro...

472
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:21,959
received the annual magic award
in 2020.

473
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,792
The performance of Wazuma
in the show

474
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:27,417
was recognised to have contributed
to the popularisation of magic,

475
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,334
so the Japan Professional
Magician's Association

476
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:32,167
gave Degawa a Fellowship Award.

477
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,584
There's a Japan Eccentric
Magician's Association.

478
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,167
Eccentric?
 Yes.

479
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,542
It's...

480
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,459
It gave me a Melon Syrup Award.

481
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,918
This is the first Wazuma Tetsuro
after a year.

482
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,000
What show is it going to be?

483
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,626
Our advisor received an award.

484
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:50,626
That's right.

485
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,626
It's the Japan Eccentric Magician's
Association's Melon Syrup Award?

486
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:56,083
I think many things are wrong.

487
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,000
Not eccentric...

488
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,834
It's Professional Magician's
Association.

489
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:01,334
The Fellowship Award.
 Yes, the Fellowship Award.

490
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:02,709
What does this mean?

491
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:03,834
To put it simply,

492
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,709
it's like the Academy Award.

493
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,542
It's that big?

494
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,292
But nobody knows what it is.

495
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,751
The director says it isn't.

496
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,417
Not the Academy Award.
 What?

497
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,375
Not the Academy Award.
 It's a comparison.

498
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:18,834
Comparison.

499
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,584
Forty minutes by train and on foot
from Shiodome,

500
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:25,751
the one who received
the Fellowship Award,

501
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:30,792
the third Wazuma Tetsuro
in Bunkyo City.

502
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,250
We've come to

503
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,500
Chinzanso!

504
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,999
The stage is a familiar
wedding ceremony venue,

505
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,542
a place in Tokyo where you can enjoy
a beautiful garden,

506
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,000
Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo.

507
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,167
What a beautiful place.

508
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,876
This is summer in Japan.

509
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,334
Yes, indeed.

510
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,667
Something has started.
 Indeed!

511
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,834
The Sea of Clouds in Tokyo.

512
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:58,999
Artificial mist is created
several times a day in the garden.

513
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:04,459
Guests can enjoy a dayandnight
magical view throughout the year.

514
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,375
I want to go there.

515
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:06,292
It's romantic.

516
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,626
It's not only here,
up there too. Look.

517
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,083
That's right.
 You can't see anymore.

518
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,000
I can't see.

519
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,918
People won't know
if you kiss someone here.

520
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:15,250
What's that cue?

521
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,209
And Maria, your costume this time
is overthetop.

522
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:22,542
Her socks are made with leather.

523
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,083
After I started wearing these,

524
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:29,417
Mr Daisuke and Mr Nakaoka
talk to me a lot.

525
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:30,959
Right?

526
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,999
What does Nakaoka say
every time he sees you?

527
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,876
Something like,
"Maria, you're pretty."

528
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,876
Wow, it's a terribly creepy episode.

529
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,959
Let's start the training at once.

530
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,542
His master this time is...

531
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,542
Hello.
 Hello.

532
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,042
Ms Moe Alicegawa.

533
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,417
She's one of the few
women Japanese magician.

534
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:55,250
This time, she prepared Wazuma magic
that even a clumsy man can learn.

535
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,542
This is an illusion!
This is an illusion!

536
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,250
First, it's a glass
and a handkerchief.

537
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,876
Into the glass...

538
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,167
we put an egg in.

539
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,999
Cover the glass
with the handkerchief.

540
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,918
Then, like this,

541
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,626
we tie an elastic rubber around.

542
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,959
This is its current state.

543
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,918
But if I cheer it on...

544
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,209
Slip, slip, slip...

545
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,292
The egg goes through the glass.

546
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,999
When?
 I see.

547
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't get it.

548
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,751
You know how it's done?

549
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,250
I'm interested to try though.

550
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,334
That's early.

551
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,959
I'll now put the egg inside.

552
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:44,792
It's in.

553
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,584
I'll cover it with a handkerchief.

554
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:47,709
When will she take it out?

555
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,542
Now?
 Yeah?

556
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,792
I'll put an elastic rubber around.
 She's good.

557
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,584
I'll now cast a spell on it.

558
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,417
Slip, slip, slip...

559
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:01,918
Then, even though it was covered,
the egg...

560
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,584
Wow, she did it.
 I admit defeat.

561
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,375
Wait... I really don't get it.

562
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:10,751
Are you stupid?

563
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,584
She pisses me off.

564
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,083
We'll now reveal how it's done.

565
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,167
The trick is very simple.

566
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:19,417
When you cover the glass,

567
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,667
turn the glass over, that's all.

568
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,834
To prevent the egg from falling,

569
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:26,209
hold it with your little finger.

570
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,918
Now, it's Degawa's turn to try.

571
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:33,334
First, put the egg into the glass.

572
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,000
Use this handkerchief

573
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,375
to cover the glass.

574
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,375
Then, what happens?

575
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,459
I clearly saw how you turned it
upside down.

576
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,999
This is a bit difficult.

577
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:45,542
Once more.

578
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,667
That's not all.

579
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,500
Take the chopsticks...

580
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,292
No, not chopsticks.

581
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,667
Next, it's a wrapping cloth.

582
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,167
This wrapping cloth

583
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,876
is said to have been
used by Nezumi Kozo.

584
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,999
And this is a Kan'ei Tsuho coin.

585
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:06,500
It's worth about 50 yen if you
calculate its value nowadays.

586
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,751
Let's wrap the coin.

587
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,417
The anecdote goes, in the past,

588
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,584
Nezumi Kozo gave out the money
he stole to the common people.

589
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,626
We'll copy this ritual a little.

590
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,083
Clink, clink.

591
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,500
Clink, clink.

592
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,083
Let's open it.

593
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:40,417
It quickly changed
into an oval gold coin.

594
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,250
Impressive.

595
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,542
Let's reveal how it's done.

596
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,834
Actually, the oval gold coin
is in the wrapping cloth.

597
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,667
Hold it secretly with the right hand

598
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,792
and put it on the table
when you open the wrapping cloth.

599
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,250
Put the Kan'ei Tsuho coin
on the gold coin,

600
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,626
and roll them together towards you.

601
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,167
This switches the wrapping cloth's
upper side and lower side,

602
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:07,083
and when you pull the edges,
the oval coin below will show.

603
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,626
It is said that Nezumi Kozo
had used this wrapping cloth.

604
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:15,083
The Nezumi Kozo here...

605
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,292
He did something.

606
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,918
It's said that he had redistributed
the common people's money.

607
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:21,918
But...
 It's there.

608
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:22,918
It came out.

609
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,083
Why is it here?

610
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,667
He gave this money
to common people... Oops.

611
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,751
What happened?

612
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,999
Wait a minute,

613
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,417
it isn't here.

614
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,209
What?

615
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,083
Oh, okay...

616
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,500
Now, the second teacher
makes his appearance.

617
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:48,083
Illusionist, Mr Magician Daiki.

618
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:52,042
He'll do a magic with chocolate,
which you can try as well.

619
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,417
It's called...

620
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,918
Infinity Chocolate.
 Infinity Chocolate.

621
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,959
Now, the second teacher
makes his appearance.

622
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:03,500
Illusionist, Mr Magician Daiki.

623
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:07,375
He'll do a magic with chocolate,
which you can try as well.

624
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,876
It's called...

625
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:12,042
Infinity Chocolate.
 Infinity Chocolate.

626
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,626
If the amount of chocolate
stays the same when you eat it,

627
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,792
doesn't it make you happy?
 It does.

628
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:19,542
To make it easy to eat
the chocolate,

629
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,125
we'll chop it.

630
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,834
He chops at two more places.

631
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,709
This is its current state.
There's one missing.

632
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,167
Watch carefully.

633
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,167
We'll move this part here.

634
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,209
Then...

635
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,500
What?
 Why?

636
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,751
Look. It's back
and there isn't any less.

637
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,000
Amazing.

638
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:41,626
This time, again,

639
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:44,083
Mr Degawa would like
some chocolate too.

640
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes.

641
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:49,667
The doctor warns me not to eat
too much chocolate,

642
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,584
but I still eat it.
 Okay.

643
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:54,667
He chops at the same places
as before.

644
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,709
Maria ate one square just now.
 Yes.

645
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,876
This time, Mr Degawa ate one square.

646
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,292
That's impossible...

647
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:05,334
We'll rearrange it.

648
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:11,209
It is back
to its original form again.

649
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:12,792
Amazing.

650
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,876
What's this?

651
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,000
One square is probably
not complete.

652
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,500
That means it was an illusion
when we were watching?

653
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:21,542
Yes, an illusion.

654
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,751
It's bad if it's an illusion.

655
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:26,083
You think it was back to
the original piece of chocolate?

656
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,209
It was back.

657
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,250
You're a really good customer.

658
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,042
But how can that be an illusion?

659
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:35,459
It's bad if I see an illusion
at such a close distance.

660
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:36,375
As a person.

661
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,918
I'm telling you it's bad.

662
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,999
Tetsuro Degawa, 57 years old,

663
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:45,375
I'm not so senile that I'd see
an illusion at a distance so close.

664
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,042
The correct answer
is it's an illusion.

665
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,500
The amount of chocolate is less,

666
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,751
but if you cut it
and move the pieces like this,

667
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,792
it looks like it's restored
to its original state.

668
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,918
Look at the size
of the middle square!

669
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,292
What do you say?

670
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,292
Wow, amazing. It's smaller.

671
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:08,375
This time, he'll perform a magic
done with a secret trick

672
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,042
and the magic Mr Daiki teaches him.

673
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,667
For example...

674
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,083
Blow up a balloon,

675
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,375
and if you burst it...

676
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:23,667
a frying pan appears.

677
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:24,626
Why?

678
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,667
He puts a pan near his chest
beforehand,

679
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:30,375
and hides it skilfully
with his left arm.

680
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:33,000
When he takes out the bamboo skewer,

681
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,751
he holds the handle of the pan.

682
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,959
Then, at the same time
he bursts the balloon,

683
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
he pulls out the pan from his chest.

684
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,834
The difficult thing
is to blow up the balloon first.

685
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,751
My lung capacity
is close to nothing,

686
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,584
that's the first problem.

687
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:54,959
People say Wazuma Tetsuro's throat
is like a baby's.

688
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,459
Oh, it flew away.

689
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,876
This is the third time you perform
as Wazuma Tetsuro.

690
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,209
It's Fellowship.

691
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,667
A man who received this award

692
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:10,626
will go on stage
and stand in front of cameras,

693
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:12,834
so I can't afford to fail.

694
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:16,250
After all, what I'm carrying now
is different from before.

695
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:18,417
Mr Daiki, who came here today,

696
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,334
is running a ramen restaurant
half the time because of Covid19.

697
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,459
Business got worse
because of Covid19,

698
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,709
so he opened a ramen restaurant.

699
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:29,292
But after he opened it,
it became very popular.

700
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,375
In the worst case,
Mr Daiki will quit being a magician

701
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,459
and become a real ramen chef.

702
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,876
Now, please watch carefully.

703
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,876
Later, the Wazuma Tetsuro Show
begins.

704
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:45,959
You say what you're carrying
this time is different,

705
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,250
but what will the show be like?

706
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,000
Guys, if you insist,

707
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:52,250
I'll offer my award if I fail.

708
00:33:52,918 --> 00:33:54,250
What?

709
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:55,667
You mean return it?

710
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,042
Yes, return. Yes.

711
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,918
You don't offer the award.

712
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:00,751
I'll return it.
 Return it.

713
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,292
Let's return it at once.

714
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,459
Wait...

715
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,209
Well, then, Wazuma Tetsuro,
please get ready!

716
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,167
Thank you for your patience.

717
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,209
He is ready.

718
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,125
Here comes Wazuma Tetsuro.

719
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,459
Hurray!

720
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,334
Fellowship!

721
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:23,334
Wazuma!

722
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:25,667
It's been a long time
since I last performed.

723
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:30,417
I'm Wazuma Tetsuro who received
the Fellowship Award the other day.

724
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,751
Hurray!
 Congratulations!

725
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,125
Congratulations!

726
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,417
First, over here...

727
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,542
I'm going to use
this ordinary wrapping cloth.

728
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,626
First, I'll put it here.

729
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,834
There's a sound.
 I heard a sound.

730
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,000
This is a Kan'ei Tsuho coin,

731
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,751
which is worth 50 yen nowadays.

732
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,459
Put this Kansui Kan'ei Tsuho coin

733
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,292
on top of this.

734
00:34:55,751 --> 00:35:01,459
It is said that Nezumi Kozo
had used this wrapping cloth.

735
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:06,500
I'll wrap the coin
with this wrapping cloth.

736
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:09,125
It's said that Nezumi Kozo

737
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:13,500
would give out the oval gold coins
he stole to the common people.

738
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:17,292
I'll now wrap this around the coin.

739
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:20,584
I'm going to open it now.

740
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:21,918
Clink, clink.

741
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,751
Clink, clink.

742
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:25,500
Clink, clink.

743
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,542
Okay.

744
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,334
Unveil it...

745
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,125
Wow, look!

746
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:37,375
An oval gold coin
appeared from inside.

747
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:38,834
Amazing!

748
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,834
I'll check to see
if this is a real oval gold coin.

749
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:46,792
People get angry at you if you bite
something made with gold.

750
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,542
It's topical.

751
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,042
He added something topical.

752
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,167
He left the stage
after that topical joke.

753
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,792
He's here.

754
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:56,667
It's that one.
 That?

755
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:03,500
Next, I'm going to use this balloon
to perform this magic.

756
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:07,209
First, I'll blow up this balloon.

757
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,209
Stretch it.

758
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,959
Is this okay?
 No, he has a baby's throat.

759
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,250
It's a baby's throat.

760
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,834
He has a baby's throat.

761
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:16,792
You can do it.

762
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,292
Wazuma.
 Mr Tetsuro, you can do it!

763
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,500
You can do it!
 Wazuma.

764
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,584
It's getting bigger.
 Wazuma! You can do it!

765
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,500
This is a balloon.

766
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:35,626
I'm going to use this
to open a hole in the balloon.

767
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:38,584
Three, two, one.

768
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,500
Go!

769
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,500
Here!
 Wait...

770
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:47,042
A pan appeared.
 That's not right...

771
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,876
Just now, after he burst
the balloon,

772
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,000
the pan came out.

773
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,626
Wazuma himself was startled

774
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,125
when he burst it.

775
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,542
"Whoa!"
 The balloon.

776
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:00,792
Oh... Well... what should I do?

777
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:02,999
Who are you asking?

778
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:04,918
Do it once more.

779
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,334
He's leaving the stage.

780
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,876
Return the award. Return it.

781
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,083
Return it.
 Return it.

782
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,292
Here he comes.
 The balloon...

783
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,751
Next, I'm going to use
this balloon oh.

784
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:19,626
Thank you for your patience.

785
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,167
Welcome.

786
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,751
"Welcome" isn't right.

787
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:25,626
The arrangement is a mess.

788
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:29,042
He pretends nothing happened.
 I'll blow up this balloon.

789
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,959
He pretends it didn't happen.
 Blow properly.

790
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,542
It's the crucial part.

791
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,542
You can do it...

792
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:43,167
I'm going to use this
to burst the balloon.

793
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:46,709
Three, two, one.

794
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:50,959
Three, two, one.

795
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Three, two, one.

796
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:55,959
What?
 It doesn't burst.

797
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,459
Three, two, one.

798
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,250
Hey!

799
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,542
This is a dream.

800
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:04,751
It is a dream.

801
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:06,500
This is a dream.

802
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,209
Where are you going?
 We'll talk later.

803
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,584
Please give up the award.

804
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:12,834
Return it.

805
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,626
The Fellowship Award...

806
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,999
We'll start all over again
and Tani will perform Wazuma.

807
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:20,959
I'm going to use this bag here

808
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:24,042
and perform Wazuma.

809
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:28,918
Could you confirm that there is
nothing unusual with this bag?

810
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,334
Indeed, this is an ordinary bag.

811
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,167
There is nothing
even if you turn it over.

812
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:36,709
There isn't, is there?

813
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:39,542
Mr Tetsuro, since this morning,

814
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,709
I've been worrying about the place
above your shoulder a lot.

815
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,167
I don't feel anything wrong.

816
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,751
Do you mind?

817
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:47,709
What is it?

818
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,417
An egg!

819
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,667
There's an egg?

820
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,459
There was an egg.

821
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:58,083
I'll use the egg that came
from Mr Degawa's shoulder

822
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:00,626
to perform a Wazuma trick.

823
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:05,876
First, I'll put the egg
on this piece of cloth and hold it.

824
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,709
When I blow on it,

825
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,834
this egg will vanish.

826
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,375
No way.
 It won't.

827
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,500
It's gone.

828
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:20,709
Do you know where the egg went?

829
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,417
Don't tell me...

830
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,250
Please let me check
your shoulder again.

831
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,876
It's the egg.
 It came out.

832
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,125
The egg is there.

833
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:31,250
Why?

834
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:34,000
There was an egg again.

835
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:39,167
I'll hold this egg in the bag again.

836
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,709
And then...

837
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:43,876
You can't deceive me
again and again.

838
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:48,542
The egg is in your right hand now.

839
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,083
Mr Tetsuro,

840
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,959
it isn't in my right hand.

841
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,584
What...?

842
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:57,292
Of course, inside the bag...

843
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,876
It isn't here either.

844
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,292
What? Where did it go?

845
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:02,083
It isn't here.

846
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,792
It's a piece of cloth.

847
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,959
Mr Tetsuro,
please give me your hand.

848
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,918
Here.

849
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,876
Look.
 Smack...

850
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,834
It isn't here, is it?

851
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:14,000
We'll check the inside

852
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,334
and the outside of this bag,
just in case.

853
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:23,167
While we're checking it,
please confirm the egg isn't here.

854
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,042
There is nothing inside.

855
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:28,125
There isn't anything.

856
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:33,417
Mr Degawa, do you know
where the egg has gone?

857
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:35,125
Look.

858
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,834
The egg...

859
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:40,083
There is nothing.

860
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,417
You can't see it?
 We can't...

861
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:47,125
I'm going to throw this egg
into this bag now.

862
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:48,918
I'll do it now.

863
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:50,375
Go.

864
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:53,292
What? There was
a tapping sound just now.

865
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,250
What?

866
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,167
Mr Degawa, please look inside.

867
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,709
There's no way
it's so conveniently...

868
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:02,834
An egg!

869
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,417
Amazing.
 There was an egg.

870
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,042
I wanted to say "An egg!"
 Good.

871
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:12,334
It won't be as interesting
if you think the egg is fake,

872
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:16,334
so could you crack the egg
into this glass?

873
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,125
It's a raw egg.

874
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:24,709
A raw egg!

875
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:29,334
Wazumaria is amazing.
 Wazumaria is amazing.

876
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:31,542
Lastly, Wazuma Tetsuro will use

877
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:34,042
playing cards to perform
a prophecy magic.

878
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:38,751
I'd like to ask someone
to help me perform this magic.

879
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,334
Okay, Imoto.
 Okay.

880
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,292
Please come here.

881
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,334
Okay, it involves the audience?

882
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:48,584
First, I'd like to ask Imoto
several questions.

883
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:52,626
You got married to the director
of this show, Mr Ishizaki,

884
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:55,250
what do you usually call him?

885
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,250
I don't know.

886
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:59,042
Well, his name is Shiro Ishizaki,

887
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,999
so it's Shikun.

888
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,125
Shikun.
 Shikun?

889
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:05,626
It's Shikun?

890
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,375
It's the first time I hear this.

891
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,626
What do you love most about Shikun?

892
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:14,042
He is kind and reliable.

893
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:17,083
Well then,
how many children do you want?

894
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:20,792
Two No, three, if possible.
 I see.

895
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:23,918
Based on the questions I asked,

896
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:28,083
I'd like to think about the unknown.

897
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,709
"It should be "Write a prophecy""

898
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,751
Something unknown?
 About the future?

899
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:34,709
Does he mean prediction?

900
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:39,542
I wrote something here,
please memorise it well.

901
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:41,959
I'll perform the magic now.

902
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,918
First, Imoto, please shuffle
the playing cards here.

903
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:53,542
Divide them into two.

904
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:55,417
Okay, I've divided them.

905
00:42:55,584 --> 00:42:59,459
Choose one pile you like,
either the left or the right.

906
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,959
I'll choose the left one.
 The left one. Okay.

907
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:06,334
Please count how many cards
there are in the left pile.

908
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,876
He suddenly got angry.

909
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:08,834
He's angry.

910
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:12,167
One, two, three, four,

911
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:17,751
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

912
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:22,417
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

913
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:26,918
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

914
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,125
21, 22, 23, 24. There are 24 cards.

915
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,500
There are 24 cards.

916
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,417
Choose a card you like among them.

917
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:38,999
Any card?
 Yes.

918
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,167
Can I look?
 Yes, you can show everyone.

919
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:46,000
Okay.
 Okay, what is the card?

920
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,250
It's three of spades.

921
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,751
It's three of spades, right?

922
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,000
As you've seen,

923
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:53,584
Imoto shuffled the cards.
 Yes.

924
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:57,042
Imoto also divided it
into two piles.

925
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:01,792
Imoto also chose the first
and chose one card among them.

926
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,918
Imoto took the initiative
in everything when she did it.

927
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,042
Go back.
 What?

928
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,167
What? It's scary.

929
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,500
What?
 Three of spades?

930
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:14,292
There are 24 cards here,

931
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:18,083
and the card she chose
was three of spades.

932
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,000
Yes.

933
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,751
Now, tonight, Azuma

934
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,751
Wazuma Tetsuro...

935
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:28,125
will outdo Nostradamus.

936
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,417
What?

937
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,709
I'll turn this board over.
 What's written there?

938
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:40,334
24 and three of spades.

939
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:45,709
It was impressive though.
 Impressive.

940
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,709
It's showtime!

941
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:49,792
He made it!

942
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:52,250
How did you know?

943
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:57,959
Oh? The reaction is rather different
from what I expected.

944
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,584
At first, I thought he should
return the award,

945
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:04,918
but now, I think Wazuma Tetsuro
deserves the Fellowship Award.

946
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,459
Thank you.
 Brilliant.

947
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:08,584
I don't need to return
the award, right?

948
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,584
But halfway...
 The pan.

949
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,042
You failed quite miserably.

950
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,876
Sorry that I told you
to return the award.

951
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:16,584
Three, two, one.

952
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,626
Go!

953
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,542
Okay!
 Wait...

954
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,999
Okay!
 That's not right!

955
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:27,834
Oh... Well... what should I do?

956
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:29,999
Who are you asking?

957
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:31,542
Return the award.

958
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:34,417
You told me to return the award?
 Sorry.

959
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,459
I panicked so much that
I didn't even hear you say that.

960
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,667
I had no idea.
 It can't be helped.
