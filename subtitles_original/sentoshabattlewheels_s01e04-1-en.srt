1
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,816
The following program was produced with
the utmost consideration toward safety

2
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,251
and features dangerous activities which
were supervised by stunt professionals.

3
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,687
Do not attempt to reenact any
of the activities performed.

4
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,525
You can hardly see anything
on this dusty road.

5
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:25,726
Akina's right behind her!

6
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,762
It's tail to nose!
They're actually touching!

7
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,896
Akina's pushing her!

8
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,332
There's another explosion!
Fujimoto is terrified!

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,801
The battle cars are ferociously jostling
for position.

10
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,104
He can't stop. He can't stop!
Is he okay?

11
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,508
The car is on its roof! Is Sata okay?

12
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:41,509
Sixth Battle

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,644
"Road to Hell." Three more matches to go.

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,515
At the moment,
Junior's army is leading by six points.

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,583
It's your turn, Shoji.

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,351
Okay.

17
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:51,318
I'm off.

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,053
See you soon!

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,288
Come on, Shoji!

20
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,758
Iwahashi, you go hard, okay?

21
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:58,692
I'll go all out!

22
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,928
Go and burn him down!
Burn them to a crisp!

23
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,964
I'll get to the front and...

24
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,633
I'll definitely get to the front and...

25
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,534
Then what?

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,568
You were just repeating yourself.

27
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,302
I'll get to the front and...

28
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,470
You said it again.

29
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:10,738
He's gonna dash and run.

30
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:11,939
Alfa Romeo Alfa GT
New car price approx. 5.4 million yen

31
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:15,776
The reckless man who often shouts out
his wife's name, Tomoharu Shoji.

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,779
This battle car
is an Alfa Romeo Alfa GT.

33
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,915
Engine 2L I4 DOHC / 166 hp / FF /
Semi-Automatic / Weight 1480kg

34
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,583
Honda Crossroad
New car price 2.9 million yen

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,985
The uncontrollable hitman,
Yoshimasa Iwahashi.

36
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:29,190
His battle car is his own car riddled
with family memories,

37
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,491
the Honda Crossroad four-wheel drive.

38
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,059
Engine 1.8L SOHC / 140 hp / 4WD /
Weight 1480kg

39
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:37,331
On this "Road to Hell," many battle cars
have already sustained extensive damage.

40
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,068
In the next race, that one man
will line up in his black Crossroad.

41
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,140
You're planning on going home
in a hired car today, right?

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,908
No, I'm going to drive this home!

43
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:48,776
I don't know about that.

44
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,211
Of course I'll go back in that!

45
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,345
Oh, I don't know.

46
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,914
Seriously, it's a car riddled
with family memories.

47
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,183
I'll get away quickly.

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,218
You'll run?

49
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,719
I'll run and not look back.

50
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,788
Your airbags will probably be deployed.

51
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,858
No way...
Show me your four-wheel drive qualities!

52
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,959
Watch those airbags.

53
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:05,860
Hey, Iwahashi.

54
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:06,760
Yes.

55
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,262
What's your strategy?

56
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,296
My strategy?

57
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,197
Yes.

58
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,834
I'm thinking shoot out
and speed like hell. Is that okay?

59
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,002
I see.

60
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,838
If that's your plan, that's fine.
But you have to win, okay?

61
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,306
Yes. It may sound stupid,

62
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,576
but I want to go home
in a car that's in pristine condition.

63
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,245
I'll run and won't look back.

64
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,448
It will also depend on how your opponent,
Shoji, decides to go about it.

65
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,049
The reckless man who often shouts out
his wife's name - Tomoharu Shoji

66
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,852
But this Alfa Romeo is...

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,754
If I can get in front, it's in the bag.

68
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:34,788
The uncontrollable hitman
Yoshimasa Iwahashi

69
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,458
In the last round,
I had some issues with the clutch.

70
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,226
It felt like it was getting stuck.

71
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,529
But I've gotten used to it now,
so it's fine.

72
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,730
-Really?
-Yes.

73
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,365
-Are you really okay?
-I'm perfectly fine!

74
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,499
Bad luck for Shoji. The camera
that films his face is inoperable.

75
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,901
Is the clutch okay?

76
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,002
The clutch is okay!

77
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,436
The car and the clutch are fine?

78
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,138
The clutch is okay, all is good!

79
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,206
Tomoharu Shoji (Alfa Romeo Alfa GT)
vs Yoshimasa Iwahashi (Honda Crossroad)

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,542
Iwahashi's black Crossroad
is a four-wheel drive car,

81
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,210
which handles off-road tracks really well.

82
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,678
By comparison, Shoji's red Alfa Romeo
is a sports car.

83
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,679
Bad luck for Iwahashi - the camera
that films his face is again inoperable

84
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,414
You would be tempted to think

85
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,116
that the four-wheel drive will have
a distinct advantage on this sandy track.

86
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,852
Can Shoji overcome this
by putting in more power?

87
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,521
Three...

88
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,255
Go!

89
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,291
Two... One...

90
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,359
Go!

91
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:17,131
Here's the start. Shoji shot out in front.
He's in front!

92
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,933
Shoji has taken the front position

93
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,635
and Iwahashi is on his trail
in his black Crossroad.

94
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,971
In the cloud of dust, they...
Oh, they've touched.

95
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,674
Iwahashi has bumped the back
of Shoji's vehicle.

96
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,475
He's gone on the attack!

97
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,910
Good boy! Keep it up!

98
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,513
Is he okay? Iwahashi has stopped.

99
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,682
The Crossroad has stopped.

100
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,850
In the meantime,
Shoji opens up a big lead.

101
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,118
He's making this count!

102
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,254
Iwahashi's Crossroad is finally back
on the move.

103
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,055
Keep going!

104
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,993
We're onto the angled bank area.
We can see it in the back.

105
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,695
The black body of the Crossroad.

106
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,364
It's hard to control a vehicle
in this slippery area.

107
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,166
Wow, is he all right there?

108
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,602
Iwahashi nearly went off-track,

109
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,137
but he somehow managed
to get back on course.

110
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,708
Iwahashi is right behind Shoji now.
He bumps Shoji in the rear again!

111
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,511
Iwahashi is on the offensive!

112
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,182
He is bumping into him from behind.
He's bumping into him!

113
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:15,656
He is attacking from behind. Whoa!
He's mounting the side of Shoji's car!

114
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,795
He is attacking from behind. Whoa!
He's mounting the side of Shoji's car!

115
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:28,268
He is attacking from behind. Whoa!
He's mounting the side of Shoji's car!

116
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,070
I wonder if Shoji is okay.

117
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,271
Get it!

118
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,172
Is Shoji okay?

119
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,209
Iwahashi drove all the way on top
of the driver's side of Shoji's car!

120
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,144
He's on the move.

121
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,212
He drove all over Shoji!

122
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,113
He drove all over Shoji!

123
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:39,847
He's all over him!

124
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,848
Go!

125
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,049
Iwahashi's nuts!

126
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,351
Shoji's okay, he's on the move now.

127
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,787
And Iwahashi crashes into him
from behind again!

128
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,822
Shoji's facing the wrong way now.

129
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:54,328
And amongst all the explosions,
Iwahashi shoots in front. That's amazing!

130
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,899
He's uncontrollable!
He's the uncontrollable hitman, Iwahashi.

131
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,501
He has come out of it on top!

132
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:06,006
Look out! He has lost control
Iwahashi somehow gets back on track.

133
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,375
Iwahashi's going all out!

134
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,177
He doesn't care whether the car
gets damaged or not.

135
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,612
He crosses the finish line now!

136
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,180
And Shoji's car is nowhere to be seen.

137
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,348
WINNER
Yoshimasa Iwahashi - 1m24s

138
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,650
We've won!

139
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,888
We've won! But that was so dangerous!

140
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,322
You look so surprised!

141
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,426
Here comes Shoji. Is he okay?

142
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,595
He is furious! He crosses the finish line,
but he's very angry.

143
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,830
Shoji, are you okay?

144
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,398
Yoshimasa Iwahashi - 1m24s - +10p
Tomoharu Shoji - 1m36s

145
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,100
Damn it!

146
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,470
You scared everyone! Hey!

147
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,973
You scared the hell out of everyone!

148
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:41,642
SENTOSHA

149
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,311
Let's have a look at the replay.

150
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:48,015
Iwahashi had been driving defensively
up to this point.

151
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,018
Starting here, however,
he went completely out of control.

152
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,787
Iwahashi was on the attack!
And look at this...

153
00:05:55,055 --> 00:06:00,461
He drives up the side of Shoji's car.
He mounts Shoji's car doggy style!

154
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,699
Iwahashi from Hamada's army
has completely come alive!

155
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,433
So scary!

156
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,335
This is battle car racing!

157
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:09,536
SENTOSHA

158
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,340
Hey! You scared the living daylights out
of everyone!

159
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,044
Are you okay?

160
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,479
It was so dangerous!

161
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,348
Your car nearly crashed through
the driver's side window!

162
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,416
Hey!

163
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,354
I thought I was going around you,
but I was actually driving over you.

164
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,256
-I'm sorry!
-It was terrifying!

165
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:33,026
Your front wheel came through my window!

166
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,096
Good job!

167
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,364
Nice!

168
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,932
-Amazing.
-Yes!

169
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,667
Amazing.

170
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,504
It had better four-wheel drive qualities
than I thought!

171
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,040
That's good!

172
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,377
It did better than I expected.

173
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,378
All right!

174
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,613
Congrats!

175
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,848
It was more of a four-wheel drive
than I thought it was.

176
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,617
-You did great!
-You were great!

177
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,519
I got so excited, I was in the zone.

178
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,253
I see.

179
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,821
I thought, "I don't care if I die."

180
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:01,755
You didn't care if you died?

181
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,956
You were on the attack.

182
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:03,857
You were on top of his car!

183
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,561
I was on top of him, and apparently,
my front tire came through his window.

184
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,029
He was really angry with me.

185
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,100
It was just one front wheel, right?

186
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,669
If it happens again,
push it out from the inside.

187
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,371
Yeah, just push it out.

188
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,640
Hamada's army - 24 points
Junior's army - 20 points

189
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,542
Hamada's army takes the lead again.

190
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:26,146
And finally, the human explosion machine
enters the "Road to Hell."

191
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,750
Seventh Battle

192
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,686
It's your turn now, Mr. Ozawa.

193
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,454
Good luck!

194
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,956
Let's go.

195
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,558
Don't you lose.

196
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,959
Can I throw some explosives?

197
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,628
No?

198
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,729
You can!

199
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,464
I can, right? Okay!

200
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,234
Let's go, Mr. Muto!

201
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,038
We're still behind by four points.

202
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:56,376
Can I drive nice and steady? Real steady.
I have a gold driver's license.

203
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,878
I've never had an accident
or any infringements.

204
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,980
You can drive safely if you like.

205
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,985
Just for a change.

206
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,320
It will be different.

207
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,287
Just once!

208
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,088
Lincoln Navigator
New car price 10 million yen

209
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,425
The unbeatable pro wrestling master,
Keiji Muto.

210
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,129
His battle car is a top class SUV,
the Lincoln Navigator.

211
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,598
Engine 5.4L V8DOHC / 304 hp / AWD /
AT / Weight 2500kg

212
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,365
Toyota Century
New car price approx. 12 million yen

213
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:21,235
The man with a face that could kill,
Hitoshi Ozawa.

214
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:25,572
His battle car is the luxury saloon car,
the Toyota Century.

215
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,140
Engine 5L V12 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 2000kg

216
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:32,312
Junior's army will want to make up for
that four-point difference.

217
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,615
But now, here comes the man
who threw a live grenade

218
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,516
at the opposition in the last round.

219
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,452
The man with a face that could kill.

220
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:41,755
The man with a face that could kill
Hitoshi Ozawa

221
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,123
Here's Ozawa.

222
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,791
He's got something in his hands.

223
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,293
He's got something.

224
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,062
Here we go.

225
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,333
I gotta pummel that Lincoln.

226
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,872
The unbeatable pro wrestling master
Keiji Muto

227
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,042
Here's Muto from Junior's army.

228
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,278
And again,

229
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,181
he is slowly transported to his Lincoln
on the back of a utility truck.

230
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,785
That looks a bit sad, doesn't it?

231
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,353
Yeah.

232
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,956
Looks like he's being taken out
with the trash.

233
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,591
Like he's being thrown away.

234
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,527
Should we add some sad background music?

235
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:22,829
Yeah.

236
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,332
Let's have a competition on who can choose
the saddest music to go with that scene.

237
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,205
And here's Ozawa.
Oh, he's got a grenade in his hand again!

238
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,978
How's it going, Mr. Muto?

239
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,647
I'm going to drive safely this time.

240
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,648
Yeah?

241
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,785
I think you've filmed
enough dangerous scenes already.

242
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:45,519
Right.

243
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,988
Let's race like adults.

244
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,593
It looks like he got in the car
with the grenade.

245
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,730
Is Muto aware of that?

246
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,332
Hitoshi Ozawa (Toyota Century)
vs Keiji Muto (Lincoln Navigator)

247
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,468
The battle is about to start
between Japan's top executive-class car

248
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,136
and America's giant monster SUV.

249
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,373
Let's go, Mr. Ozawa.

250
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,541
Okay.

251
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,875
Let's go!

252
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,143
Three... Two...

253
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,945
The engine power
is basically the same for both cars.

254
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:15,315
The weight is two tons for the Century,
compared to 2.5 tons for the Lincoln.

255
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,551
How will the 500 kilogram difference
affect the outcome of the race?

256
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,552
Here they go!

257
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:23,490
Ozawa goes to the front.
That's so dangerous! Ozawa!

258
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:27,494
Ozawa goes to the front
That's so dangerous! Ozawa! Is Ozawa okay?

259
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,896
Oh, my God!

260
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,065
Ozawa cuts loose right from the start!

261
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,035
Wow, they've already bumped into
each other.

262
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,905
The Lincoln Navigator and the Century
have already made contact.

263
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,042
Ozawa reached back.
He's holding something in his left hand.

264
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,811
He's holding a grenade in his left hand!

265
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,079
He's driving one-handed

266
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,614
while he carries a grenade
in his other hand.

267
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,949
He's going wild. Amazing.

268
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,118
They can't see anything in the back now.

269
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,023
Look at this!
No one can see through this cloud of dust!

270
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,226
In this cloud of dust...
Wow, he continues to drive one-handed!

271
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,228
If you consider this, his driving skills
are very impressive.

272
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,963
But it's Muto who is currently
in the lead.

273
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,666
But here comes Ozawa.
Trying to control the unruly Century.

274
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,269
Here comes the Century!
He's right on Muto's tail.

275
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,704
Wait, what happened?

276
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:14,841
What just happened?
This is the view from the car.

277
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,913
It exploded!
The grenade just exploded in the car!

278
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,915
It exploded next to Ozawa! Is he okay?

279
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,483
Is Ozawa okay?

280
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,919
He's still driving!

281
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,988
Amazingly, Ozawa is still driving

282
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,256
even though a grenade just exploded
in his car!

283
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,991
Wow, it doesn't worry him at all!

284
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,227
How frightening!
He's the human explosive!

285
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,265
Here they start colliding with
each other again.

286
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,068
The front of the Century has sustained
a lot of damage.

287
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,102
Go!

288
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,105
Ozawa doesn't seem to mind that.
Wait, wait!

289
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,308
He's colliding with
all sorts of things now. Very dangerous!

290
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Stay away from that man! He is dangerous!

291
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,346
Wow, Ozawa's wrecking everything in sight.

292
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,015
Hurry up!

293
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,083
Hurry!

294
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,484
Ozawa, you idiot!

295
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,054
Now, can Muto take advantage of this
and reach the finish line first?

296
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,759
Is Ozawa going to come storming back?
Oh, there's another explosion!

297
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,194
That's hot!

298
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,464
Here he comes from behind.
He's going wild again!

299
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,631
He hits Muto from behind again!

300
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,532
It's so hot!

301
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,803
Muto keeps saying that it's hot!
Look out, look out!

302
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,172
The giant rock hits him!

303
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,508
But the Lincoln Navigator is sturdy.

304
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,544
And here comes Ozawa again from behind!

305
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,812
But Muto finishes first!

306
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,115
And Ozawa follows him to the finish.

307
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,783
The winner is Junior's army!

308
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,618
WINNER
Keiji Muto - 1m36s

309
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,086
Keiji Muto - 1m36s - +2p
Hitoshi Ozawa - 1m38s

310
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,490
That was so hot!

311
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,702
Yeah, Muto!

312
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,237
The fire was so hot!

313
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,771
Muto!

314
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,209
How did it go?

315
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,211
It went well. I drove nice and steady.

316
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,746
-It went well.
-Yeah.

317
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,581
-That car's power was really amazing!
-Right.

318
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:02,682
SENTOSHA

319
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,151
Go!

320
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,685
Let's have a look at the replay.

321
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,954
It was already an eventful start
to the race.

322
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,022
Here!

323
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,758
See Ozawa fly!

324
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,229
See Ozawa fly!

325
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,039
He is nearly sideways there.
He has amazing driving skills

326
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,476
to be able to keep control of that car.

327
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,181
Well, Ozawa is known
to do his own stunts in movies.

328
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,919
And here Ozawa looms from behind,
trying to keep control of his Century.

329
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,188
It was around here
that a grenade exploded in Ozawa's car.

330
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,222
Right there!

331
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,826
This is the moment.

332
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:48,895
Right here.

333
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,798
Amazingly, Ozawa keeps driving
even after being blinded

334
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,567
from the smoke from the explosion.

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,235
Terrific driving there.

336
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,905
While Muto's Lincoln barely shows
any signs of damage,

337
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:03,276
Ozawa's Century shows extensive damage
to the radiator and suspension.

338
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,178
It's close to breaking down.

339
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,846
There's another collision!

340
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,683
This is a painful defeat
for Hamada's army.

341
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,752
Well done.

342
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,421
I tried pretty hard.

343
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,056
You did well.

344
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,324
You did your best.

345
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:21,361
I was trying to throw a grenade,
but it exploded in my hand.

346
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,462
Is your hand okay?

347
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,330
I'm fine.

348
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,198
You don't need to take grenades with you!

349
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,400
Why were you carrying it with you?

350
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,368
It exploded in your hand?

351
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,669
I was trying to throw it.

352
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,505
Then the car spun, so it exploded
while I was trying to regain control.

353
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,609
The car filled with smoke!
Look, my sunglasses are dirty!

354
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,244
So that's why they got dirty.

355
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,579
Right.

356
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,948
All things considered, you did great.

357
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,483
Those marks on your clothes
are from the grenade?

358
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,884
It's not from the dust!

359
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,253
It's from the grenade!

360
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,687
Hamada's army - 24 points
Junior's army - 22 points

361
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,957
With the final match remaining,
Hamada's army is leading by two points.

362
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,260
For Junior's army to make a comeback,

363
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,129
they must win the final match
by at least three seconds.

364
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,599
Last Battle

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,268
Here we go, Mr. Harada.

366
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,002
Yes.

367
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,470
The time has come.

368
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,638
Right.

369
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,940
The scene is set.

370
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,874
Yes.

371
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,944
Let's finish up by winning the last race.

372
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,479
-Go for it.
-Yes.

373
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,780
Let's go!

374
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,649
It's all on you now.

375
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:16,750
Let's go, ETC!

376
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,085
I'm Mr. ETC!

377
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,988
Yeah!

378
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,790
Audi Allroad Quattro 2.7t
New car price approx. 8.6 million yen

379
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,593
The hero who makes your blood curdle,
Ryuji Harada.

380
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,796
His battle car is an Audi Allroad Quattro.

381
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,332
Engine 3.2L V6 DOHC Twin Turbo / 255 hp /
4WD / AT / Weight 1860kg

382
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,133
Toyota Corolla Van
New car price 1.5 million yen

383
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,069
Resurrected after ten years of silence,
the Golden Boy,

384
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,537
Keiichi Yamamoto.

385
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,473
His battle car is the Toyota Corolla Van.

386
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,609
Engine 1.3L I4 DOHC / 82 hp / FF / 4MT / Weight 930kg

387
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,477
Compared to the Audi,

388
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,079
a true four-wheel drive

389
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,882
with a 255-horsepower twin-turbo engine,

390
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,251
the Toyota Corolla is a manual car

391
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,420
with only an 82 horsepower engine.

392
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,021
Will this even be a contest?

393
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,694
Finally, the last battle
on the "Road to Hell" has arrived.

394
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,497
Hamada's army has a lead of two points,
which only equates to two seconds.

395
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,466
Resurrected after ten years of silence,
the Golden Boy - Keiichi Yamamoto

396
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:07,634
Here's Yamamoto.

397
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,771
He is still disheartened from getting
his own Volkswagen Beetle

398
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,039
trashed by Sata earlier.

399
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,575
I guess he's wondering
how he's going to get home.

400
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,376
SENTOSHA

401
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,112
Here's the replay of the incident.

402
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,347
Sata was driving Yamamoto's car,

403
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,282
given to the program
by his comedy partner Kato,

404
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,051
and he couldn't turn the slippery corner
and went straight into the dirt wall.

405
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,186
The car overturned.

406
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,563
A substantial amount of the loan
on the car had still not been paid off.

407
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,465
The Beetle is now destined
for the scrap heap.

408
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,167
Has Yamamoto recovered from the shock yet?

409
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,169
SENTOSHA

410
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:47,140
If you look closely,
that man's eyes look ready to kill.

411
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,208
If you look closely?

412
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:48,942
Yes.

413
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,343
The hero who makes your blood curdle
Ryuji Harada

414
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,847
Have a look at that.

415
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,582
That's where the crash happened.

416
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,016
Scene of the Beetle's accident

417
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,819
How it ended up there, I will never know.

418
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,187
Yeah, I know.

419
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,523
Ryuji Harada (Audi Allroad Quattro)
vs Keiichi Yamamoto (Toyota Corolla Van)

420
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,792
We're massively disadvantaged
with the car.

421
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,094
That's right.
But Yamamoto will do it for us.

422
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:08,928
It's kind of...

423
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,696
He'll do it?

424
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:10,430
He will.

425
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,701
Harada from Junior's army
gets into the black Audi.

426
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,174
Here's Yamamoto.

427
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:21,975
What's that?

428
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:25,845
There's something that looks like
a black pipe on the right side of the car.

429
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,380
Mr. Harada.

430
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,314
Yes.

431
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,983
You need to win by three seconds.

432
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,717
What?

433
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,086
We'll win if you can win
by more than three seconds.

434
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,421
Three seconds.

435
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,489
-I can run and not look back?
-Yes.

436
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,892
Let's win by a big margin.

437
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,960
Be careful of the dust cloud, okay?

438
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:41,694
Okay.

439
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,964
It's all or nothing. Please let us win.

440
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:46,900
Here we go, Yamamoto.

441
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,001
Yes!

442
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,538
Let's go.

443
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,639
Good luck.

444
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,910
Three... Two... One...

445
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,645
Go!

446
00:17:59,212 --> 00:17:59,946
Here they go.

447
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,515
From the outset, Harada from Junior's army
has gone full speed.

448
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,651
If Harada can finish ahead
by at least three seconds,

449
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,553
Junior's army can make a comeback
and win this round.

450
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:10,056
Harada accelerates here
to head straight to the finish line.

451
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,693
By comparison, Yamamoto
in the delivery van cannot keep pace.

452
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,463
He's so slow.

453
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,965
The gap is less than three seconds
at this point.

454
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:19,699
He needs a bit more.

455
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,567
It's not three seconds yet.

456
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,337
Is Yamamoto still disheartened from seeing
his beloved Beetle destroyed?

457
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:30,643
Is the gap closing?
Yamamoto seems to be catching up a little.

458
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,512
Here's Harada.

459
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,148
From the bank,
they come up to the slippery area.

460
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,683
They need to be careful here.

461
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,452
This is where Yamamoto's Beetle
met its terrible fate.

462
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,288
What's that? Something shot out
from the black pipe!

463
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,958
And there's an explosion!

464
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,593
Same thing has happened to Yamamoto.

465
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,262
It's mud! A mud ball is being shot out
from the pipe!

466
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,199
It must have confused Harada,
he has slowed down a little.

467
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,468
Yamamoto in the delivery van
has closed the gap.

468
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,036
And look at the fire!

469
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,506
Yamamoto really managed to catch up!

470
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,408
With his Beetle having been destroyed,

471
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,943
he's giving a great performance
in the delivery van!

472
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,646
He's chasing the back of the Audi,
waiting to pounce!

473
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,413
All right!

474
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,748
Yes! Yes!

475
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,550
Still less than three seconds.

476
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,653
Even if Yamamoto loses,
if he follows Harada like this...

477
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,921
It's a really good race!

478
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:18,525
Oh, he made a move!
Yamamoto from Hamada's army is in front!

479
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,560
An amazing performance from Yamamoto!

480
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,630
Look at that concentration.
What happened to Yamamoto!?

481
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,431
And he crosses the finish line!

482
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,432
WINNER
Keiichi Yamamoto - 1m01s

483
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,567
Yamamoto from Hamada's army
has won the race!

484
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,601
The winner is Hamada's army.

485
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,236
This means that in this moment,

486
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,605
Hamada's army has won
the "Road to Hell" round.

487
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,773
Keiichi Yamamoto - 1m01s - +5p
Ryuji Harada - 1m06s

488
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,477
Second round - Hamada's army wins

489
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,445
So cool!

490
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,179
Amazing!

491
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,415
He was amazing!

492
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,216
Amazing!

493
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,818
No!

494
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,487
Damn!

495
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,389
No way!

496
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,190
Something just...

497
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,293
Something just popped out of there!

498
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,028
But I won!

499
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,630
I won!

500
00:19:58,998 --> 00:19:59,666
SENTOSHA

501
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,035
Here's the replay.

502
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,204
There were mud ball guns

503
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,574
set up in both of their cars!

504
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,809
Compared to Yamamoto's delivery van
with much less power,

505
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,078
Harada's Audi was a four-wheel drive
suited to driving on off-road tracks.

506
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,582
The difference in quality
between these cars was evident.

507
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,018
However, as we will see, here,
Yamamoto passes Harada on the inside!

508
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,554
Yamamoto took his chance when Harada
went wide in that corner.

509
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,591
An amazing performance by Yamamoto!

510
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,759
Hamada's army claims victory
in the "Road to Hell" round.

511
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,663
The two armies are now head-to-head
with a win and a loss each.

512
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,967
Hey, Junior!

513
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,768
-Yeah?
-Give us one of your cars.

514
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:36,936
Come on.

515
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:37,904
We don't want to.

516
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,341
Then...

517
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:46,012
We'll give you back this crap car
that you gave us.

518
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,547
We'll give you back Katsumata's car.

519
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,615
We should take it.

520
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,582
Really?

521
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,651
-It hasn't been damaged yet.
-It's really quick, too.

522
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,086
It was so close.

523
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,287
It was really close.

524
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,623
We'll lose the Fairlady Z as well.

525
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,725
We'll take the Fairlady Z
as the reincarnation of the Beetle.

526
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,226
Let's take good care of it.

527
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,427
That's right.

528
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,328
Right.

529
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,097
Can I drive it home today?

530
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,067
I don't have an electronic toll card
anymore, though.

531
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,469
I won't take the tollways.

532
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,638
I'll take the ordinary route
without tolls.

533
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,640
Just pay the toll in cash!

534
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,975
Yeah, just use cash!

535
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,145
I'd like to pay all toll charges
with my ETC card.

536
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,647
Just pay cash!

537
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,220
Although Yamamoto's Volkswagen Beetle
is headed to the scrap heap,

538
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,423
Hamada's army was able to claim victory
on the "Road to Hell."

539
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,762
The devious Hamada celebrates his victory,
just for a little while.

540
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,665
Yippee!

541
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,768
Yippee!

542
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,469
Yippee!

543
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,439
Yippee!

544
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,710
The army of zombies that survives

545
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,545
even after a grenade explosion.

546
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,515
The tables have been turned.

547
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,786
Those barbarians are unbelievable!

548
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,789
How could anyone survive
a grenade exploding in their car?

549
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,893
Forward! Let's go!

550
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:11,664
We'll defeat them! It's now or never!

551
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,701
The impregnable Junior Castle.

552
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,170
Is it about to be taken?

553
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,972
Junior's Army - Mercedes-Benz Kompressor, Volvo V70,
Jaguar XJ Executive (retired), BMW 330i

554
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,809
Junior's army had the Fairlady Z
they won in Round 1

555
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,011
taken away from them
with their loss in Round 2.

556
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,213
In addition, the Jaguar Executive
had to be retired

557
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,381
due to the damage sustained in Round 2.

558
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,817
Now they have seven battle cars remaining.

559
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,752
Mercedes-Benz S320, Alfa Romeo Alfa GT,
Lincoln Navigator, Audi Allroad Quattro

560
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,686
Hamada's Army - Nissan Fuga, Toyota Celsior,
Nissan Fairlady Z, Nissan Skyline

561
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:34,821
As for Hamada's army,

562
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:38,091
the Volkswagen Beetle and the Century
were retired at the end of Round 2.

563
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,259
That leaves them with six battle cars.

564
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,463
The team with the most battle cars
in the final round

565
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,666
will have a distinct advantage
in the final battle.

566
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:47,834
Volkswagen Beetle (retired),
Nissan Laurel (removed),

567
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,035
Honda Crossroad, Toyota Century (retired),
Toyota Corolla Van

568
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,406
Will Chihara Junior
be able to protect his castle?

569
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,208
Or will Hamada,
the pervert barbarian from Osaka,

570
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,643
come and take Junior's castle?

571
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,453
You Really Might Die, round three.

572
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,856
Romantic Flight.

573
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,457
YOU REALLY MIGHT DIE, ROUND 3
ROMANTIC FLIGHT

574
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,227
This is a battle car
long jump competition.

575
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,497
The army that jumps further will win.

576
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,067
Any battle car that participates
in this round

577
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:25,204
will definitely be forced into retirement
due to the massive impact from the fall.

578
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,342
The run up to the jump is 30 meters.

579
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,844
The battle will be decided

580
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,614
by how far the cars are able to fly
after accelerating

581
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,315
off the top of the 150 centimeter ramp.

582
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,352
We're jumping this?

583
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,286
It's quite high here.

584
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:41,554
This is the most dangerous of all.

585
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,889
That's really high.

586
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:43,756
It is high.

587
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:44,891
Only pros can do it.

588
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,092
Who's going?

589
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,060
-Can I give you my opinion?
-Yes.

590
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,430
Don't you think we always do well
when Seiji goes first?

591
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,899
That's true.

592
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,933
Yes.

593
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,436
How about the leader competes
in this challenge?

594
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,741
The leader takes responsibility?

595
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,743
You're just trying to weasel out of it.

596
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:08,414
Imagine Mr. Hamada in lots
of safety gear going for that jump.

597
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,249
-He would be good at it.
-No way!

598
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,484
He would be great.

599
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:15,454
And it would look so funny
with your tiny little mustache.

600
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,092
No, no. I think Seiji is our man.

601
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,595
If Mr. Hamada wants me to do it,
I'd be very happy to have a go.

602
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,629
Hamada's army
Seiji Chihara

603
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,799
I think it helps that you got
a screw loose up there, too.

604
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,335
You knew?

605
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,037
He's not afraid of anything.

606
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:31,938
That's right.

607
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,740
I really need you to jump very far.

608
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,008
Why?

609
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
What is it?

610
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:39,779
Well...

611
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:44,183
You know how you're supposed
to jump off that ramp?

612
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,352
The closest car to the ramp is my car.

613
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:47,753
Really?

614
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,055
Don't worry about it.

615
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,490
You need to jump at least
further than my car.

616
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,759
You know my car is quite heavy
in comparison.

617
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:54,694
Yes.

618
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,262
It would make quite a dent.

619
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,331
If you can jump over my car, it's fine.

620
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,232
If you carry a lot of speed, it's fine.

621
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,967
The back of the car is undamaged.

622
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,068
At the moment, the rear is untouched.

623
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,236
It's unscathed.

624
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,103
Yeah.

625
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,341
It doesn't matter anymore,
as the front half is wrecked already.

626
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,110
It doesn't matter, but I don't want
to add to its suffering.

627
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,712
I guess.

628
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:13,746
Fujimoto, let's go!

629
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:14,480
No!

630
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,182
-Fujimoto!
-No way!

631
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,950
Why don't you want to do it?

632
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:22,321
I have my daughters to care for.
Please spare me from this.

633
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,590
Then Shoji.

634
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,626
I can't do it either.

635
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,360
Why?

636
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,395
I still have a mortgage to pay.

637
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:33,266
You know, you don't have to pay
the mortgage if you die, right?

638
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,269
-I'll get edited out if I die on the show.
-No, you won't.

639
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,404
Amazon will even show someone dying?

640
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:39,672
Sure, it'll be fine.

641
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,041
I can't do it. I've got kids, too.

642
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,109
How about Itakura?

643
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,512
My grandma told me not to do
anything too dangerous.

644
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,214
Is it the rule in your family?

645
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,782
-Is it an Itakura family motto?
-Yes...

646
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,484
-Don't...
-Do anything dangerous?

647
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,852
Yes, it's from my grandma.

648
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,186
It can't be helped then.

649
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,589
Then it's gotta be that guy.

650
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,859
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Harada?
Mr. Harada?

651
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:00,826
What's wrong?

652
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:01,861
He's trying to smell the airbag.

653
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:02,962
It really stinks.

654
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,864
What? It stinks?

655
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,232
We were going to get the person

656
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,400
who smelled the airbag
to do this challenge.

657
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,368
This was always the rule.

658
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,703
In that case, it's me then.

659
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,537
Right.

660
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,271
Junior's army
Ryuji Harada

661
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,005
Okay.

662
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,340
Please fly like a dragon.

663
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,642
Then I'll show you how a dragon flies!

664
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:17,376
All right!

665
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,377
It's decided then!

666
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:19,111
All right!

667
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,279
Audi Allroad Quattro 2.7t
New car price approx. 8.6 million yen

668
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,814
Representing Junior's army,

669
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:25,384
the hero who makes your blood curdle,
Ryuji Harada.

670
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:29,488
He'll go on a romantic flight
in the Audi Allroad Quattro.

671
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,624
Engine 3.2L V6 DOHC Twin Turbo / 255 hp / 4WD / AT / Weight 1860kg

672
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,694
Pretend that you're already in the car.
Could you do a test flight?

673
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,561
Go!

674
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,898
Jump!

675
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,167
Here we go! He jumped!

676
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,402
Mr. Harada, you need to be
more aerodynamic. Like this!

677
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,671
You need to retract the landing gear.

678
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:49,675
Go!

679
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,777
What are you doing?

680
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,512
What the hell are you doing?

681
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,148
You won't be the one jumping.
The car is.

682
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,150
What are you doing?

683
00:26:58,384 --> 00:26:59,785
-What are you doing?
-I'm fine now.

684
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,154
What are you going to find out
by running up like that?

685
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,222
It was a test run!

686
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,660
In this Romantic Flight round,
first on the runway is Junior's army.

687
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,665
In this Romantic Flight round,
each team will have

688
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,400
one representative who competes.

689
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,401
Junior's army, Ryuji Harada - Test run

690
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,236
This is Harada from Junior's army.

691
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,206
There is a ramp waiting

692
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,641
at the end of a 30-meter stretch.

693
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,778
We can see three cars
on the other side of the platform.

694
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:31,150
These cars will act as cushions
when the battle cars land.

695
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,885
If they weren't there, the battle cars
would need to absorb a lot of impact,

696
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:35,287
endangering the lives of the foot soldiers
competing in this round.

697
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,189
They will act as cushioning devices.

698
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,595
Oh, there's Yamamoto's Beetle.

699
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:46,599
Yamamoto's Beetle
that Sata managed to wreck.

700
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,667
This will be its final act.

701
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,342
It's looking good.

702
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,344
Good.

703
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,112
Good, good.

704
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,381
It's good. We want to give him a push.

705
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,053
Harada's Audi has a 3.2 liter
twin-turbo engine.

706
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,688
It is very, very powerful.

707
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,693
This is a long jump competition
using battle cars.

708
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,030
How much speed can they gain
after the start?

709
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,399
This will be an important factor
in this round.

710
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,369
The representative for Junior's army
is Harada.

711
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,272
We are nearly ready to start.

712
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,342
He needs to enter the platform straight.

713
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,812
It's really dangerous if he falls.

714
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,116
If I can't enter the jump straight,
is it better to brake?

715
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,150
Or is it better to keep going?

716
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,552
After the jump...

717
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,387
I think you can hit the brake
as soon as you've made the jump.

718
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,255
I mean, before the jump.

719
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,990
When you realize you're not straight
going up the ramp, what do you do?

720
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,992
Then you should adjust the steering wheel
to make sure that you're straight.

721
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,196
You're okay with that?

722
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,797
You're okay with that instruction?

723
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:52,898
Seriously.

724
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,166
It's not like you drive cars for a living.

725
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,070
How are you doing, Mr. Harada?

726
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,472
Yes, I'm ready to go now.

727
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,074
How are you? Are you scared?

728
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,843
I am scared, but...

729
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,445
It depends on if you can keep your foot
on the accelerator.

730
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,947
You need a lot of courage.

731
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,015
-You need to let off somewhere, too.
-Yeah, that's true.

732
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,219
If you let off,
you won't be able to jump as far.

733
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:17,022
I've lived 46 years
and experienced a lot of things.

734
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,291
I think this is a culmination
of all of that.

735
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,426
Wow.

736
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:22,795
-You're going to show it to us.
-That's great.

737
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,396
Mr. Harada.

738
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,999
-What are those?
-They're wings.

739
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,267
Wings?

740
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,568
So he can fly far.

741
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:30,302
I see.

742
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,338
Please present these to him, Junior.

743
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,106
-Here we go.
-Does it go on the door?

744
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,709
They go right next to the door handles.

745
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,446
Let's fly! Oh, it's attached.

746
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,014
It looks like it will fly very far!

747
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:42,915
It does, too.

748
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:43,883
-Mr. Harada!
-Yes.

749
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,885
We're wishing you luck!

750
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,553
-Good luck!
-We'll be watching!

751
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,287
Let's go!

752
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:49,021
Thank you!

753
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:49,755
Thank you!

754
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,425
This grand battle is taking place
in Susono near Mount Fuji

755
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,194
to decide who will reign supreme.

756
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,897
You Really Might Die, round three.

757
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,965
This round is called Romantic Flight.

758
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:06,906
Now the battle is about to commence
between two courageous foot soldiers

759
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,742
from both Junior's army and Hamada's army

760
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,713
to decide who can jump the longest
and who is the most courageous.

761
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,282
In this Romantic Flight round,

762
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,251
they will be risking their lives
in their battle cars.

763
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,754
First to compete

764
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,722
is Ryuji Harada from Junior's army

765
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,291
who was the only one
to put his hand up for his team.

766
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,926
Look at the wings on his car.

767
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,829
Can he fly?
Oh, the right wing just fell off!

768
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,866
The right wing came off.

769
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,801
Harada is completely unaware of this.

770
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,771
He is at maximum concentration.

771
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:39,972
Now he just needs to go full throttle!

772
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,508
Three... Two...

773
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:43,342
One...

774
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,076
Come on!

775
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,511
Go!

776
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:48,614
There he goes without his right wing.
He stomps hard on the accelerator!

777
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:53,485
He accelerates! Harada takes off!

778
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:56,021
What is the distance?

779
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,527
Is he okay?

780
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,761
How is he?

781
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,330
You're kidding!

782
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,064
Oh, my God!

783
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,400
The Beetle's okay?

784
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,437
The Beetle's okay.

785
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,938
Okay!

786
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:13,839
It was a good jump!

787
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:14,607
It didn't hit the Beetle.

788
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,708
SENTOSHA

789
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,311
Of course, the distance
that the cushioning cars moved

790
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,780
after the impact will not count.

791
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:25,818
The distance will be measured from
where the front of the battle car touched

792
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,053
the back of the second cushioning car.

793
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,200
Are you okay?

794
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,101
Mr. Harada, are you okay?

795
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,169
Ryuji? You really flew.

796
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,337
It was a good flight.

797
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,672
Amazing!

798
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,806
He's okay!

799
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,541
Are you okay?

800
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,777
-The impact was massive!
-Is he really okay?

801
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:52,611
You were great!

802
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,946
How was the impact?

803
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:55,648
It was massive.

804
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,382
That bad?

805
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,916
You'd think so.

806
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:58,984
The parked cars moved this far forward.

807
00:31:59,051 --> 00:31:59,985
Nice flying!

808
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,354
That was amazing!

809
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,689
Nice!

810
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:04,857
Thank you very much.

811
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,394
The results are in

812
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,162
for Harada from Junior's army.

813
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:14,033
He flew 7 meters, 77 centimeters! Amazing!

814
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,902
Yeah!

815
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,404
Mr. Harada, you're amazing!

816
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,872
Thank you.

817
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,843
Seven meters? I thought it was
more than that. I see.

818
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:25,911
Amazing!

819
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,279
Seven meters?

820
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,682
That's crazy!

821
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,819
He jumped quite far.

822
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,258
Harada recorded an enormous jump
of 7.7 meters.

823
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:43,429
Can Hamada's army
surpass Harada's Romantic Flight?

824
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,437
Now, this is

825
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,708
Harada's Audi that performed
that great jump.

826
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:59,011
You can understand why, once you take
flight, the car is automatically retired.

827
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:05,417
This battle car literally risked its life
so that Junior's army could be victorious.

828
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:09,221
The battle car chosen by Seiji Chihara
from Hamada's army

829
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,990
is the Fairlady Z they reclaimed
in the last round.

830
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:12,991
New car price 3.5 million yen
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1440kg

831
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,027
Although the car weighs only 1500 kg,

832
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,230
it's powered by a 3.5-liter engine.

833
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,632
Hamada's army, Seiji Chihara - Test run

834
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,802
The distance recorded by Harada
was 7.7 meters.

835
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:27,373
Seiji from Hamada's army
will be aiming to surpass that distance.

836
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,411
Should I drive more to this side?

837
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:33,412
Yes, like that.

838
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:34,947
He's veering to the left.

839
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:35,914
He is.

840
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,624
Seiji has a determined look on his face.

841
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,627
Oh, I see. The width of the platform
is quite narrow.

842
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,529
And Seiji is now driving

843
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,267
the Fairlady Z, not the Toyota Celsior
he was driving earlier.

844
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,506
Wow, it's narrow.
The ramp is just barely wide enough.

845
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,141
That's close.

846
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,444
He needs to reach this at top speed

847
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,347
then drive off the ramp and jump.

848
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,551
When you compare this Fairlady Z
and the Audi,

849
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,921
the engine power is the same, yet
the Fairlady Z is 400 kilograms lighter.

850
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:20,092
You can say that this car was made to
compete in this Romantic Flight round.

851
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,995
This car really is powerful!

852
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:24,897
Amazing!

853
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:26,832
You're good.

854
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:28,934
You're driving right in the middle now.

855
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:29,668
You're doing well.

856
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,502
I feel confident now.

857
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,236
That's great.

858
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:32,871
That's good.

859
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,810
Wow, look at that acceleration!

860
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,313
I've got it now.

861
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,850
Looks like he's got the hang of it now.

862
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,420
-That acceleration is amazing!
-It's amazing!

863
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,389
Yeah.

864
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,858
It accelerates so easily.

865
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,126
It's so scary.

866
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,128
Go on.

867
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,963
We'll put the wings on so it can fly.

868
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,566
Seiji, we'll put wings on, okay?

869
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,668
Thank you.

870
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,203
The members will be happy, right?

871
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,138
Of course.

872
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,139
I think this will jump really far.

873
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:07,806
Thanks.

874
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,508
Good luck!

875
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,910
Good luck!

876
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,249
Wow. He's so fearless.

877
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,017
To jump at that speed.

878
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:19,985
I think he'll jump real far.

879
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:20,719
Right?

880
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:23,222
He just needs to jump further
than the back of that second car.

881
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:23,956
Yeah.

882
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,226
Oh, it's the front.

883
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,760
He just needs to get on top of that car.

884
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:29,495
That's right.

885
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,131
He needs to go beyond that.

886
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,567
We'll win if he goes beyond this point.

887
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,503
That's amazing.

888
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,073
Stories about this great battle
between Hamada and Junior

889
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,875
at Susono near Mount Fuji

890
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:47,012
will be recorded for thousands of years.

891
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:51,149
Many battle cars have come and gone.

892
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,287
Seiji Chihara teamed up with Hamada,
the pervert barbarian from Osaka,

893
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:59,324
after he betrayed his own brother,
Chihara Junior.

894
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,127
Oh, Harada's Audi from before

895
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,630
is one of the cars acting
as cushions for Seiji.

896
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:05,797
Three...

897
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,599
Two...

898
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,433
One...

899
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,936
Harada's record was 7.7 meters.

900
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,238
Seiji's going for it!

901
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,274
Come on! Fly, Fairlady Z!

902
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,409
Whoa! That was amazing!

903
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,580
Yeah!

904
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,383
That was an astoundingly massive jump!

905
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,817
He did it!

906
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,121
Great!

907
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:29,955
That was great!

908
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,189
What?

909
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,058
What?

910
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,192
What?

911
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,761
That was so scary!

912
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:36,595
SENTOSHA

913
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,164
Let's have a look at the replay.

914
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:42,034
Seiji's Fairlady Z shows
an amazing acceleration here.

915
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,403
And here he jumps!

916
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,872
He's gone all the way beyond two
of the cushioning cars,

917
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,173
the Beetle and the Audi!

918
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,208
He's crashed into the third car.

919
00:36:58,517 --> 00:36:59,751
That's so far!

920
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,754
You jumped so far!

921
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:03,589
That's amazing!

922
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,490
That's amazing!

923
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,059
Awesome!

924
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,160
That was amazing!

925
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,864
That's amazing!

926
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,134
It was a great jump! Beautiful!
Absolutely beautiful!

927
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,872
This is a great car!
It really is a fantastic car!

928
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,343
So, Harada's record was 7.7 meters.

929
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,111
How did Seiji Chihara do?

930
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,947
Wow! 13 meters!

931
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,116
With that unbelievable jump,

932
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:32,818
he's won the Romantic Flight round!

933
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,854
Hamada's army wins Round 3

934
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,623
That was amazing!

935
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,192
Oh, wow.

936
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:43,061
I'm glad we won that car back before.

937
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,197
It's a great car.

938
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,399
It's off the charts.

939
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,243
Hamada's army wins two in a row.

940
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:02,914
The losing Junior's army must hand over
one of their battle cars to the victors.

941
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,851
You need to give us the Lincoln.

942
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:06,785
No, no.

943
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,487
We won by a massive margin!

944
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:09,755
I have no choice.

945
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,524
We'll give you Akina's Mercedes.

946
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,292
Mercedes Benz SLK230 Kompressor
Junior's army - Hamada's army

947
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,162
I'm sorry, I have to hand over
Akina's Mercedes.

948
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:20,699
What's wrong with you? Stop this, Junior!

949
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,835
They're giving us the little car.

950
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,604
You're giving us your smallest car.

951
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:26,838
It's the smallest one!

952
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,442
The grand car battle.

953
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,844
With Seiji's crazy big jump,

954
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:35,881
Hamada's army also won the third round.

955
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:41,053
Let's kill them off now!

956
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,789
We must take Junior Castle now! Fight!

957
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,593
Fight! It's now or never!

958
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:50,295
Junior's Army

959
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,231
Junior's army has now lost
the Mercedes-Benz Kompressor,

960
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,802
in addition to the Audi
that was retired after the last round.

961
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,971
They now have five battle cars remaining.

962
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,940
Volvo V70, BMW 330i, Mercedes-Benz S320,
Alfa Romeo Alfa GT, Lincoln Navigator

963
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,908
Hamada's Army

964
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,143
While Hamada's army did add the Mercedes
to their fleet,

965
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,914
the Fairlady Z had to be retired
after the last round.

966
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:11,650
They have six battle cars left.

967
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:12,718
Nissan Fuga, Toyota Celsior,
Nissan Skyline,

968
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:13,618
Honda Crossroad, Toyota Corolla Van,
Mercedes-Benz Kompressor

969
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,454
Muto in the Lincoln Navigator!

970
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,354
The first battle - Junior's army's victory

971
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,589
Now, they just need to hit the brakes!

972
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,191
Muto's stopped.
Ozawa crashed into the wall!

973
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,325
Did he even touch the brakes?

974
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,060
Yes!

975
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,096
Harada, wow, one centimeter!

976
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,197
Yes!

977
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,834
I'll kill them all!

978
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:29,735
The second and third battle
Hamada's army's victory

979
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,937
The battle cars are ferociously jostling
for position.

980
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,739
Oh, the car has spun around!

981
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:38,610
Whoa!
He's mounting the side of Shoji's car!

982
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,012
Damn it!

983
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,883
Come on! Fly, Fairlady Z!

984
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,085
Whoa! That was amazing!

985
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,855
That was amazing!

986
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:53,792
Stay put! Protect the castle at all cost!

987
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,895
The last battle will be
a one-on-one sumo battle

988
00:39:56,962 --> 00:40:00,432
between each team's remaining battle cars.

989
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,635
The army that annihilates the other army

990
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,804
will be victorious.

991
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:08,006
The door is getting pummeled.

992
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,209
Muto is going in for the kill!
He's going in for the kill!

993
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,247
Now he's armed himself with a bazooka!

994
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,983
Oh, it's getting smashed again.

995
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,418
The bazooka! Use the bazooka!

996
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,154
He is getting pushed out.

997
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,989
Will he lose to the power
of the four-wheel drive car?

998
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,693
