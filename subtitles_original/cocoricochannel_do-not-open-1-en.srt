00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:11,125
(COCORICO Channel)

3
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:37,862
Hey, Mike.

4
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,729
What will you do

5
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,222
if you  hear

6
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,268
rat‐tat‐tat at the door

7
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,503
and

8
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:52,585
"Can you let me come in?"

9
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:56,213
of stranger?

10
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:58,383
I will not let him so.

11
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,099
Why?

12
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:02,453
Because he may be

13
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,406
a robber who pretended to be in trouble.

14
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:06,540
So I'll not open the door.

15
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,646
That may be possible,

16
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,448
so you mustn't do.

17
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:11,533
Yeah.

18
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:13,463
Well.

19
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:16,922
What will you do

20
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,716
if you may have seen him before?

21
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,582
I will not open the door, too.

22
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:23,894
Why?

23
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:25,972
Because I might have seen him

24
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:30,263
on wanted poster.

25
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:32,743
That may be possible,

26
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,621
so you mustn't do.

27
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:35,945
Yeah.

28
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,353
Well,

29
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:41,778
What will you do if he is uncle Tom who is a kind baker?

30
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,216
I will not open.

31
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:44,492
Why?

32
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,878
Because he may become robber unexpectedly

33
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:51,757
even if he is always kind.

34
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,933
"Why has such gentle man done such thing?"

35
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,632
We often heard such thing, right?

36
00:01:58,938 --> 00:01:59,878
Yes.

37
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:01,250
Well,

38
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:04,218
what will you do if he is Mr. Brown at your school?

39
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:05,504
I will not open the door.

40
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,420
Why?

41
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,483
I just don't like him.

42
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,106
What a simple sense!

43
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,114
It's important in your life.

44
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:14,112
Yes.

45
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:16,343
Well,

46
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:21,359
what will you do if it is a hungry squirrel in forest?

47
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,331
I will not open.

48
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:24,864
Why?

49
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:26,193
Because

50
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,257
such thing happens

51
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,180
only at fairy tale.

52
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,197
I've never seen or heard about such squirrel.

53
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:33,171
So I'll not open.

54
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:34,742
Yes.

55
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,475
It's scary if a squirrel knock the door

56
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:39,996
and talk to us,

57
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:41,908
right?

58
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:42,635
Yes.

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,040
Well,

60
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,243
what will you do if he is your grandfather?

61
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,646
My

62
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:51,599
grandfather?

63
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:52,753
Yes.

64
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:55,978
I'll not open.

65
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,970
Why?

66
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,852
Because there's not my grandfather lives here.

67
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,689
Hey, did you see his face?

68
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,344
No-no-no-no.

69
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:33,734
What's that atmosphere?

70
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:34,837
Oh, no. How scary!

71
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:35,716
Oh, my goodness.

72
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:36,547
What's that atmosphere?

73
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,575
He played with scare intentionally, right?

74
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,316
No-no. It's you.

75
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:39,977
You asked me scary thing, huh?

76
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:40,497
It's so scary.

77
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:41,087
It's completely horrible story.

78
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,186
He said "there's not my grandfather lives here".

79
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:42,637
That's because you said...

80
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:43,051
Stop.

81
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:43,500
you asked it.

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,437
But he is right.

83
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:45,947
Although I'm like old,

84
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,101
I'm not his grandfather

85
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,920
but his father.

86
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,830
So I told you

87
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,575
"there's not my grandfather lives here".

88
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:52,748
But how scary atmosphere did you make?

89
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:53,359
I've just told you

90
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,169
there wasn't grandfather here.

91
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,249
I told you clearly.

92
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:56,209
How horrible story this is!

93
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,149
I really told you clearly.

94
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,199
It was like horror movie, right?

95
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:58,669
It's scary.

96
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,039
Hey, stop saying strange thing, huh!

97
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:01,838
What has happened then?

98
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:02,228
I, by myself, thought

99
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,938
"Did I do anything strange?".

100
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:03,258
Stop.

101
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,106
What was that pause?

102
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:04,995
It's scary, right?

103
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,520
It's really scary, right?

104
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,719
No-no-no-no.

105
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,530
But,

106
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,790
you may think "How old is he?",

107
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,382
right?

108
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,751
Hey, it's none of your business.

109
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,751
This is makeup for today's performance.

110
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:14,542
"There's not grandfather in my home"!

111
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,338
I told you clearly!

112
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,199
How scary!

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,859
Stop it now.

114
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,528
No, it's really scary.

115
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,783
Don't make me surprised.

116
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:20,753
Oh, my goodness.

117
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,432
Don't make fun of me, huh!

118
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:48,819
Hello, it's "Pizza Italiano".

119
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:49,329
Hey, it's pizza delivery.

120
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,761
Yes, we've ordered it.

121
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:51,741
We ordered 2 pizzas.

122
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,230
It's pizza delivery.

123
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,161
We ordered 2 pizzas.

124
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,230
It's pizza delivery.

125
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,007
It's pizza delivery

126
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:58,312
though we were talking about stranger.

127
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,132
We ordered pizza

128
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,495
few minutes ago.

129
00:04:59,495 --> 00:04:59,855
Don't make me surprise!

130
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:01,120
It's just pizza delivery.

131
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,879
There're our medium and large pizzas.

132
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,795
What a good timing.

133
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,615
I thought it was stranger

134
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,055
just like we've talked about now because

135
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:08,471
it was possible.

136
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,055
It may be possible

137
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,135
like some movies.

138
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:10,866
And it may be possible

139
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,026
also in TV dramas.

140
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:13,646
I'm so surprised.

141
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,175
It's pizza delivery though.

142
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:16,125
And although we wanted only one pizza,

143
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,365
he ordered two.

144
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:18,195
Both large and medium size.

145
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:18,975
No-no-no-no.

146
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,617
I can eat up whole of pizza though it's so large.

147
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:21,478
No-no-no-no.

148
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,088
You know large size pizza at this shop is so large, right?

149
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,338
Large size pizza at this shop is so large.

150
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,418
Now, let's take our pizzas.

151
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,370
I'm going, too.

152
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,099
Oh.

153
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:32,527
Oh, no!

154
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:39,865
We got pizzas!

155
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:44,467
That sound was of falling pizza.

156
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:46,362
Look this large pizza!

157
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,663
It's larger as I imaged.

158
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,463
How large it is!

159
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,083
It's too large.

160
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,583
And I've told you we couldn't eat up all.

161
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,293
The sound of pizza falling

162
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:53,343
is so similar to someone's falling down.

163
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,543
And it was good timing.

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,110
It's too large size pizza.

165
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:57,894
Isn't it too large?

166
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,420
So I've told you we couldn't eat up all.

167
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:01,622
I'll eat remained pizza next day.

168
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,771
I think it's not enough to eat up in 2 days.

169
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,780
I like remained pizza more than just delivered.

170
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,363
Don't say like about curry and rice.

171
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:07,233
Don't say like...

172
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,579
I like remained pizza more than just delivered.

173
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,799
It's large pizza.

174
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:10,598
Too large pizza.

175
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:11,373
Too large pizza.

176
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:12,234
Too large pizza.

177
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:12,782
Anyone wants to eat?

178
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:13,742
Anyone wants to eat?

179
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:15,698
I'm following large pizza.

180
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:16,597
Too large pizza.

181
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:18,069
I'm following large pizza.

182
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:19,406
Oh, no.

183
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,398
Stop following me.

184
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,028
Behind large pizza.

185
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,111
Oh, no. Stop chasing me!

186
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,405
Now, I'm chasing you.

187
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:25,172
I'm chasing medium pizza.

188
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,712
Oh, no. I'm followed.

189
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,911
I'm chasing medium pizza.

190
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,339
I'm chased by large pizza.

Please subscribe! (Please subscribe!)
