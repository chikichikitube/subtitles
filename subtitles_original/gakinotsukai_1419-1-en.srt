Another quiet intro.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,900
Excuse me. What are you doing?

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,800
With the nose spray?

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,840
Figured it was a good time...

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,460
with the overall mood being terrible.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,140
The mood is not terrible.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,920
Tonight. I finally got full control.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,960
To break into the movie industry.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,260
Movie industry?

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,800
Well, we all got to appear...or should I say, more like, allowed to participate perhaps?

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,140
Yes, well, I was responsible for the casting and did this and that, but...

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,620
what do you all think is booming right now?

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,780
Eh? I wonder.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,960
Yes, Tanaka.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,860
So sudden.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,180
Movie industry? Period pieces?

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,400
WROOONG!

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,020
Right now. There's an unprecedented, heart-warming love-romance boom.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,420
This movie is really for the T1 class...

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,340
You mean teen, right?

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,780
Yes, the teens are booming.

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,400
Right now in the movie industry, an unprecedented heart-warming love-romance boom!

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,660

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,320
That's where, tonight...

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,560

Here is the cast over here.

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,980
I picked all these. Even the names.
- Oh really?

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,080
Hamasaki, Iku.

35
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,760
This girl's the main character.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,540
"Iku" as in to live.
- Yes, Iku as in to live.

37
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,240
Later there'll be an explanation as to why.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,980

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,680
And the Principal is Matsumoto Hitoshi.

41

The Teacher role is Tanaka.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,420
And the PE teacher is Endo.

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
However, it's all the "Iku" character.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,540
For me, that sticks out.

45
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,280
Yeah, now that you mention it.

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,840
Yea, you're right! I could've written "Vice Principal" or something.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,160
For me, honestly, my screen time wasn't very much.
- That's true!

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,800
Mm, I really apologize for that.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,140
You could've even flipped these, I feel.

50
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,480
Tanaka was on screen a lot.

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,360
I was pretty much non-existant.

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,620
Right, what was that with me and Endo?

53
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,540
Well, that was your acting skills.

54
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,740
Wait a minute.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,080
I can understand me, but Matsumoto-san?

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
But he was the lead in Busjack 2.

57
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,260
It's becuase I saw that.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,180
I doesn't stink that much!

59
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,180

Just the last year, she appeared in 9 movies!

Playing the heroine in many heart-warming love-romances. A popular young actress!

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,320
So shall we get started?

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,500
Start what?
- "What?", we're gonna watch it.

- The finished product.

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,080
You're not finishing it.

69
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,820
It is finished.

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,980
I did read your script one time. I don't think it's as rich as that though.

71
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,720
You praised me, didn't you?

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,860
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,380
After you read it, when we were in the restroom...

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,020
You said, "You're a smart fool."
- "A smart fool."?

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
I didn't say it like that. No, I...

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
read your script and thought it was a little amusing.

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,120
Now, how it plays out, I'll have to see it to understand.

78
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,080

We're so much alike.

106

It's just coincidence.

107

More importantly, you better get home soon, Iku.

108
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,080
Right. That name, Iku. I don't care for it.

109

Iku as in "to live". Sounds kinda lame.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,320
Isn't that the name your dying mother gave you so you could live on?

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,320
Don't talk like that.

112

My dad...

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,000
my real dad...

185
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,000
there's only one in the world.

186
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,820
♪ Why...do...

187
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,560

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,060

Teacher?

192
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,760
Thank you.

193
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,760
For telling me the truth.

194
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
The name, Iku.

195
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
I love, now!

196
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,760
Let's go home together!

197
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,900
♪ Wanna be by your side...

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,160

204
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,320
looks more and more like yours.

205
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,600
♪ her unbending gentleness...

211

What the hell!

212
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,160
What's wrong?

213
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,980
What kind of tears are those?

214
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
It's bad.

215
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,480
What's bad?

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
Well it is bad.

217
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
It could go either way.

218
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
No.

219
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,460
Wait.

220
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,520
Um...

221
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm crying so much I can't breathe.

222
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,500
Wow...really...

223
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,280
you're...

224
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,760
you're serious, aren't you?

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
I heard a rumor...

226
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
you cried when writing the script.

227
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,540
Is that so?

228
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,440
You cried.

229
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,360
Seriously?
- I cried as I wrote it.

230
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,020
What part was the sad part?

231
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,020
What part was the sad part?

232
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,640
That's...

233
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,220
um, Iku...

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,060
the person she liked all this time, was her real father.

235
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,860
But she doesn't accept him as her real father.

236
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,560
Right?

237
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,540
he raised her...

238
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,240
Sorry, but...

239
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,220
you're copying, "Yamachan ain't quitting".

240
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,100
With this setting.

241
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,400
We can't take you seriously.

242
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,100
But you're serious, aren't you?

243
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,320
It was amazing.

244
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,520
Isn't the timeline a little off?

245
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,260
She suddenly graduates.

246
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,520
That's because graduation was nearing.

247
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,380
We didn't know that!

248
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,880
You would know. It's because you weren't watching properly!

249
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,280
Talking and jibber-jabbering.

250
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,680
It didn't even feel like Spring.

251
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,060
You couldn't tell what season it was.

252
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,980
No, it all flows...smoothly.

253
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,640
Yes, all the supporting scenes were taken.

254
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,760
What does Tanaka think? You worked the hardest!

255
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,900
No, no, no. Actually, there wasn't much direction.

256
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,480
Yeah!

257
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,660
A behind the scenes glimpse!

258
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,520
Director Housei and his problem scenes.

259
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,640
You're learning your lines now?

260
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,920
Sorry, sorry. I can't remember them.

261
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
Do we need that part with you singing?

262
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,300
Of course we do.

263
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,220
What would we do without it?

264
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,500
What is this?

265
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,500
What the!

266
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,940
Who are you?

267
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Does a director appear this much?

268
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,600
It would've been fine with just the music.

269
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,860
Yea, no, what do you think Matsumoto-san?

270
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,000
What do you think about the song?

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,880
Well, it's a lil out of place. It's kinda like you were from another dimension.
- Yes, yes...

272
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
Like no one can really see you.
- Yes, yes...

273
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,620
You keep saying, "Yes, yes" but...

274
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,260
You didn't even explain any of that!

275
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,420
Ah! Is that what you meant?
- Yes, yes...

276
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,400
My only scene...

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,740
it's so small to begin with.

278
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,000
To have my small lines cut out was quite the shock.

279
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,460
I keep hearing he's walking with my daughter!

280
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,520
It's not like that.

281
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,780
Sir, please calm down. It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

282
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,420
It ain't no misunderstanding!

283
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,740
Get it together! I'm really pissed!

284
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,240
Excuse me!

285
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,100
He wanted to retake it.

286
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,600
I didn't think it was a real take!

287
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,260
I thought it was a practice run. "OK! It's OK." EH!?

288
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,500
I thought it was rehearsal so I wasn't satisfied.

289
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,660
No, it was good.

290
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,660
I wanted the Principal to do it halfheartedly so it was really good.

291
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,240
But my voice wasn't quite ready, kinda hoarse.

292
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,240
This is the take Matsumoto wasn't satisfied with.

293
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,200
Where does Hamada-san sit?

294
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
What's with this guy?

295
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,440
What the...

296
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,580
Please.

297
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
All cast.

298
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,620
Thank you very much.

299
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,600
Matsumoto-san, you're over here. Thank you very much.

300
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
Here's Yuna-chan! Thank you very much!

301
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,140
Director, will my feet show?

302
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,040
Your feet?

303
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,200
Would this be fine?

304
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,400
Will the feet show? How's the angle?

305
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
You decide!

306
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,440
You're the Director!

307
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,120
Should I wear shoes?

308
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,820
Shoes? You're fine if they don't show. How's the angle?

309
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,640
Shouldn't I wear them?
- Says he should wear them!

310
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,060
They won't show.
- The won't show!

311
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,680
This part's the foreshadowing.

312
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,180
It's the heart of the story.

313
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,060
You're learning your lines now?

314
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,140
Sorry, sorry. I can't remember them.

315
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,620
Not, "I can't remember them."!

316
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,300
For real, I can't remember them.
- Let's stop with the, "I can't remember"

317
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,140
I keep saying the same lines so I can't remember.
- How can that be?

318
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,500
We have you properly in the frame so...

319
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,500
What was that?

320
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,320
Ready...and...start!

321
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,200
OY!

322
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,180
What's your teacher teaching!?

323
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,540
I keep hearing he's walking with my daughter!

324
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,440
It's not like that! I was the one who...

325
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,700
Sir, please calm down. It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

326
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,020
It ain't no misunderstanding! I'm hearing it!

327
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,360
Yes! We got it! Thank you very much!

328
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,400
(Director: OK!)

329
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,120
We got an "OK" from the Director.

330
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,000
(Director: OK!)

331
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,760
(Director: Good! Good! Good!)

332
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,440
Was that good?

333
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,100
It's good.
- I didn't like it.

334
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,880
It kinda got rattle-y.

335
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,180
I didn't think it was a real take...

336
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,680
Are you kidding?

337
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,420
That might be a good take.

338
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,000
What does Tanaka think? You worked the hardest!

339
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,140
No, no, no. There wasn't much direction.

340
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,980
Yeah!

341
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,020
Felt neglected?

342
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,940
Felt neglected so I wasn't sure what to do.

343
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,140
He wouldn't tell us anything.

344
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,960
I wasn't exactly sure how to deliver my lines...

345
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,780
No, in fact, I was pondering that too.

346
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,420
Pondering?

347
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,020
Were you pondering?

348
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:33,380
[Director Housei's pondering scene.]

349
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,840
OK. We got it.

350
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,020
Oh, oh, nice, nice.

351
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,160
That last part...

352
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
maybe she's looking at Tanaka?

353
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
On the outside looking in...

354
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,960
Director, how was Hamada's acting?

355
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,120
I was...moved.

356
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,500
What are you talking about?

357
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,280
Um...Papa to Nacchan, was it?

358
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,360
I saw that back in the day and...

359
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,120
you've really matured.

360
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,400
So he wasn't good back then?

361
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,120
That part where Tanaka reveals the truth, you should've had her shocked more.

362
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,260
Yeah, that's true.

363
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,420
In Hamada's scene, Iku already knows you're behind the tree.

364
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
The tree's too far away.

365
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,200
The tree and Hamada are too far away.

366
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,940
There's no way he would've heard with the cicadas.

367
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,680
He did hear it.

368
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,620
What's with this guy?

369
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,740
What role is that?

370
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,740
He ain't even directing...

371
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,560
I don't get it.

372
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,300
Let's get started!

373
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,180
Alright! Here we go!

374
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
Big scene! Big scene!

375
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm leaving at 5.

376
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,980
It doesn't matter, waiting is work too.

377
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,820
It's been a while tho.

378
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Ready...and...start!

379
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,580
Thank you very much.

380
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,000
He was feelin it! He was feelin it!

381
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,680
Those were real tears!

382
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,860
Also Endo's scene...

383
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,300
the picking up of the signboard.

384
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,020
That acting...stunk.

385
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,540
That stunk too!?

386
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,520
Director Housei on Endo's stinky acting scene.

387
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
"Tanaka-sensei~"

388
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,260
I didn't say it like that!

389
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,980
Also Endo's scene...

390
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,140
the picking up of the signboard.

391
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,780

There I am.

395
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,920
(Stinks!)

396
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,840
Eh!? That's it!?

397
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,260
Did it stink?
- That didn't stink!

398
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,460
The way you moved.
- No, not at all!

399
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,200
Was that OK, Director? It seemed to stink.

400
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
It did stink.

401
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,000
Even the part where he calls Tanaka stunk a little too, didn't it?

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,080
A little. What is it? It's like you know he's there, but he isn't.

403
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
He comes in and is all like, "Tanaka-sensei~".

404
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,460
I didn't say it like that.
