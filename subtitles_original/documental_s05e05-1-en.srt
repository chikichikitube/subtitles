FINAL EPISODE

4
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,166
Hi. I'm Hollywood Zakoshisyoh.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm aware I'm what you'd call
an offensive player.

6
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,133
But!

7
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,867
Eiichiro Funakoshi betrayed me!

8
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,667
He uses Viagra!

9
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,834
He has a penis sticker!

10
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,600
Hi, I'm Chihara Junior.

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,600
For a comedian,
when there's no laughter for so long,

12
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:07,500
it gets really, seriously depressing.

13
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:10,934
I'm about to come.

14
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:15,900
You have to convince yourself.
"I'm okay. I'm funny."

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,333
"Somebody's laughing somewhere."

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,433
There's nothing you can do but
believe in yourself and just keep going.

17
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,734
And I laugh so easily.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,467
POST-FILMING INTERVIEW

19
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,800
-It's done.
-It's done.

20
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:33,834
-It was exhausting even just to watch.
-It was.

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,567
I think this season had
quite a few highlights.

22
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,767
Everyone tried so hard.

23
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,333
We really couldn't have asked for more.

24
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,266
OFFENSE HIGHLIGHTS:
CHIHARA JUNIOR

25
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I have to touch my eye?

26
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,900
OFFENSE HIGHLIGHTS:
HOLLYWOOD ZAKOSHISYOH

27
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,900
Hey! Wait a minute!

28
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,967
OFFENSE HIGHLIGHTS:
JUNIOR & ZAKOSHISYOH

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,633
ATTACK POINTS SO FAR

30
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,100
HOLLYWOOD ZAKOSHISYOH: 5
CHIHARA JUNIOR: 3

31
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:38,500
Just you and me, doing something together.

32
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,400
This is a first, isn't it?

33
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:41,934
Right.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,200
I couldn't be happier.

35
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Yeah.

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,834
Here we go.

37
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,667
Okay, I see.

38
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,433
I'll be right back.

39
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,934
This is an over-exaggerated Akira 100%!

40
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,967
Did you get sweaty palms?

41
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,967
Did you get sweaty palms?

42
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,367
Sweaty palms.

43
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,600
Did you get sweaty palms?

44
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,266
Did you get sweaty palms?

45
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,133
Did you get sweaty palms?

46
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,700
Sweaty palms.

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,266
This sure is funny.

48
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,934
That's a funny sight.

49
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,734
Keep it up.

50
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,500
Imagine watching it so close up.

51
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,600
Did you get sweaty palms?

52
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,300
Sweaty palms.

53
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,567
Sweaty palms.

54
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,266
Good, good.

55
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,533
He endured it.

56
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,700
You don't know much about games,
do you, Junior?

57
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,133
-No, I don't.
-You don't play.

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,133
-You mean video games?
-Yes.

59
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,967
That rules out video game impressions.

60
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,033
-You made a list?
-I did.

61
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,200
-You have so many.
-I do.

62
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,867
How about Toshi-chan?
Want to see my Toshi-chan?

63
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,934
-Out of all these, you'll do him?
-Yes, Toshi-chan.

64
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,133
Here I go. Junior, look.

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm Toshi-chan!

66
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,367
I'm Toshi-chan!

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,367
I'm Toshi-chan!

68
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,834
Toshi-chan!

69
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,433
Toshi-chan!

70
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,367
What are you gonna do, Toshi-chan?

71
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,233
Hey, Toshi-chan...

72
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,100
I'll do an Ikko impersonation. Ikko.

73
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,633
I'll do an Ikko impersonation. Ikko.

74
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,133
-You don't say her catch phrase?
-I don't.

75
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,567
-You don't say it?
-I don't.

76
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,767
You don't say it?

77
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,600
Is there a version where you do say it?

78
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,767
No.

79
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,633
Time for the zombies.

80
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,934
Here come the zombies.

81
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,066
There's someone
I'd really like you to meet.

82
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,233
Who?

83
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,667
Someone I'd like to--

84
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,066
-Okay.
-Really?

85
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,800
-You don't mind?
-Well, okay.

86
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,333
But we are a little busy.

87
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,066
Please sit.

88
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,934
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
-Okay.
-Will you sit down?

90
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,800
-Sit here?
-Yes.

91
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,467
We're a little busy.

92
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,166
-Yeah, we are busy.
-I'm sorry about that.

93
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:05,433
But I think you'll be happy to meet them.

94
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,033
-We'll be happy?
-So it's someone we know?

95
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,500
I think you know them.

96
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,166
Please come in.

97
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,834
-Do you know who it is?
-No.

98
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,800
Yes, you do.

99
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,367
No, I don't.

100
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,433
I'm sure you do.

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,433
He looks very angry.

102
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,100
He scares me.

103
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,734
You must know him.

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
-I don't!
-I have no clue.

105
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,533
It's Teru from Joto High School!

106
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,066
Give me everything you've got!

107
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,467
Give me your underwear!

108
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
-I'm Teru!
-It's really--

109
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,900
If you have a problem,
come see me at Joto High!

110
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:48,800
Got it?

111
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:50,166
It's really that Teru.

112
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,066
He's wearing gangster pants!

113
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,033
Give me those jeans!

114
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,200
The mic's stuck.

115
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,200
His shoes...

116
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,233
He's laughing.

117
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,834
Because it got stuck?

118
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,433
No, I was just thinking...

119
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,467
How clumsy can you get?

120
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,900
-It's all Takahashi's fault.
-That was a little difficult to judge.

121
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,400
Junior is definitely out.

122
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:50,166
However, there's still time on the clock.

123
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,967
And since it was a zombie
that made Junior laugh,

124
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:56,500
Zakoshi has to endure zombie attacks alone
until the time is up.

125
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:57,900
-What?
-I see.

126
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,834
If he laughs, there'll be no winner.

127
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:01,767
Damn.

128
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,800
-But that's only 30 minutes more?
-Right. 30 minutes.

129
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,667
Anyway, Junior is eliminated.

130
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,200
What made you laugh?

131
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,967
It was such a clumsy effort.

132
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,233
The mic's stuck.

133
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,066
His shoes...

134
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,266
The cord was pulled tight.

135
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,066
Let's go, Junior.

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

137
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:28,033
-You almost lost it in the first half.
-Yeah. I was in real trouble.

138
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,033
I thought I'd be kicked out
in 20 or 30 minutes.

139
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,600
"A gum-like substance came out."

140
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,333
Hello.

141
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,967
I'm Junichiro Koizumi.

142
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,433
Junior...

143
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,633
Zakoshi is just too strong.

144
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,767
Na, ka, ta. Nakata

145
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:04,166
He's too strong?

146
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,567
He's strong.

147
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,433
I did it.

148
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,233
I'm the only one left.

149
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:14,767
Come on, zombies!

150
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:15,800
Come on!

151
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:16,934
Bring it on!

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,333
Okay, let's go.

153
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:30,033
A half hour of Zombie Time?
That'll be super hard.

154
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,200
All I can do is, "Not laugh."

155
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,700
Come in.

156
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,934
Lie down over there. The open space.

157
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,467
Sorry about the mess.

158
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:50,200
-You been here before?
-Yes, about six months ago.

159
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,767
-You're a regular.
-But the location changed.

160
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,934
New location. We have a new owner.

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
We have a new owner.

162
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,934
Lie down here.

163
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,433
Here, mister.

164
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,233
Were you having sushi?

165
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:04,266
We were having a Chinese New Year party.

166
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,467
Lie down there.

167
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,900
Did you lose weight?

168
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,000
You think so? Thank you.

169
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,033
Are you busy with work?

170
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,567
Do I lie down on my stomach?

171
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, on your stomach.

172
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,066
Here?

173
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,767
-You lost a lot of weight.
-Really?

174
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,333
-You must be tired.
-Yes.

175
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,000
-Where do you feel most tired?
-Well...

176
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,734
Around my lower back.

177
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:34,934
Here?

178
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,600
The area around my hip.

179
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,100
Is it raining outside?

180
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,100
-You don't know what the weather's like?
-I don't. I'm always inside.

181
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,300
Okay. Let's do the oil massage.

182
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,834
You'll feel so good, mister.

183
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,066
It's a special deal.

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,867
All of our girls are so good. Lily, Lulu.

185
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,767
All of them are so cute.

186
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,967
Lily is from Dalian.

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,567
-Dalian.
-Lulu is...

188
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:00,400
Lulu is from Shanghai.

189
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,367
They're so cute.

190
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,500
Are you his friend, mister?

191
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:09,967
We're friends.

192
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,633
It feels tight here.

193
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:17,033
Thank you very much, mister.

194
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,600
That's all.

195
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,066
But...

196
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,467
Give me the VIP Treatment, please.

197
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,734
Get on your back.

198
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,300
Is it cold outside?

199
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,867
Actually, it's warm outside today.

200
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:39,000
We don't have many girls now.
It's February.

201
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:42,033
Everyone goes home for Chinese New Year.

202
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,233
All right.

203
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,934
Here we go.

204
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,000
Mister.

205
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,367
-You have muscles. You must work out.
-Thank you.

206
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,600
-You work out.
-Thank you.

207
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,166
Do you have a girlfriend?

208
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,834
-I don't.
-No?

209
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,767
He has a wife though.

210
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,367
-You're married?
-Yes.

211
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,567
-No fooling around, then.
-I can't.

212
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,300
-You can't come to my parlor.
-I can't.

213
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,567
He comes a lot.

214
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,867
-Don't get ticklish.
-Sorry.

215
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,333
Here we go, mister.

216
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,767
Your lymph nodes.

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,133
Lymphatic massage for lymph nodes.

218
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,567
Lymphatic massages
are the ones that feel the best.

219
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,600
Lymphatic massages feel the best.

220
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:36,000
You don't have any hair here.

221
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,467
It's a long story.

222
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,834
You must fool around!

223
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,066
One thing led to another and I lost it.

224
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,467
You have no hair. You must fool around.

225
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,166
Okay.

226
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,567
There you go.

227
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,800
Okay. Thank you.

228
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,467
The VIP Treatment has a higher level.
"Best VIP Treatment."

229
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,500
-I'll have that, please.
-Okay.

230
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,500
Thank you, mister.

231
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,533
Best VIP Treatment.

232
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,100
This one feels the best.

233
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,667
-It makes you feel the best.
-What idiots.

234
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:10,033
The lymphatic massage treatment.

235
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,367
Mister is having the lymphatic massage.

236
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,600
-Total idiots.
-Lymphatic massage...

237
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,467
Stop moaning. Stay still!

238
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:19,533
Sorry.

239
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,033
Stop moving. You make me jump.

240
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,066
The lymphatic massage treatment.

241
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,133
Mister.

242
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,433
Intense lymphatic massage.

243
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,867
-How embarrassing.
-Zakoshi...

244
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,133
Have you been to our parlor in Tamachi?

245
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,166
I've never been there.

246
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,266
-We have a new owner.
-Is that so?

247
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,200
I've been to the one in Shimbashi.

248
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:48,700
First-time customers
can make an appointment on the phone.

249
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,467
First-timers must call.
But the second time,

250
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,066
I can give private massages.
VIP Treatment.

251
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:56,800
Tickle, tickle.

252
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,200
The lymphatic massage treatment.

253
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,667
Thank you, mister. Well done.

254
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,300
Don't touch there!

255
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,533
You need "VIP Touch Treatment"
to touch me.

256
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,533
"VIP Touch" to touch.

257
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,066
-You want to touch?
-Yes.

258
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,734
Only touch here.

259
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:24,467
This special treatment feels good, mister.

260
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:28,266
The best one is "VIP Propeller Treatment."

261
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,633
Propeller treatment.

262
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
VIP Propeller Treatment.

263
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,967
Now let's rotate the other way.

264
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,600
I like it that way.

265
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,033
-This way?
-Yes.

266
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,233
The feel-good massage.

267
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,967
The feel-good massage.

268
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,734
The best feel-good massage.

269
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,934
Wait, wait.

270
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,300
It feels the best.

271
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,400
This is no time to laugh.

272
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:59,033
-That's all.
-Can he have a turn now?

273
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,700
I see. That's the strategy.

274
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,033
Really?

275
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,633
That may be a good idea. I see.

276
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,433
This will be tough.

277
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,266
This will certainly be tough.

278
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,533
Him too?

279
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,000
It's his first time.

280
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,133
This could be the climax.

281
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,700
It's your first time? Let's take this off.

282
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,233
Just lay down, mister.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,066
Like this.

284
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,166
Where do you feel tight?

285
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,467
-My neck.
-Your neck? Okay.

286
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,200
Mister, you want VIP Treatment?

287
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,433
-Yes, thanks.
-Okay.

288
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,033
Okay, on your stomach.

289
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,467
You mean on my back.

290
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,934
Yes, on your back.

291
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,033
Okay, the feel-good massage.

292
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,800
You have a big belly!

293
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,734
You must eat a lot.

294
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
Look at you.

295
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,166
What have you been eating?

296
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,066
It stinks.

297
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,400
No, it doesn't.

298
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,633
VIP Treatment.

299
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,667
The VIP Treatment starts now.

300
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,000
Lymphatic massage.

301
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,567
Lift up your legs.

302
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,834
That's right.

303
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,633
The lymphatic massage.

304
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,467
The lymphatic massage treatment.

305
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,066
Mister, this is the lymphatic massage.

306
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,133
Lymphatic massage treatment, mister.

307
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,100
There, mister.

308
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,834
Why move like that?
You look like a cockroach!

309
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,266
Is the shower working?

310
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:36,834
No?

311
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,600
The shower...

312
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,800
Is he laughing?

313
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,734
Is that him laughing?

314
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,867
Okay.

315
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,867
This is the last step.

316
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,567
Where are you touching? Hurry up.

317
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,934
When I touch here, we're done.

318
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,633
And that's it.

319
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,233
That's the end, mister.

320
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Do the rest yourself. That's the end.

321
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,166
-Thank you. Now take a shower.
-Thanks.

322
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,633
-Did that feel good?
-It did.

323
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,066
Our parlor is more fun when you come
with your friends.

324
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,934
-Take a shower, okay?
-Yes.

325
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Aren't you done with the shower yet?

326
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,400
What if they massaged Jimmy?

327
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,433
I kind of want to see that.

328
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,200
Go, mister.

329
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,500
Are you done? He feels better.

330
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,367
-How was it?
-It felt good.

331
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,133
Are you meeting with friends?

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,533
Yes, we have to go.

333
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,066
I'd like a massage too.

334
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,633
Me too, please.

335
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,900
Do you have an appointment?

336
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,567
I made one just a while ago.

337
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,667
-Do you mind if I watch?
-Is that okay?

338
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,133
Excuse me.

339
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,200
Wait a minute.

340
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:28,934
Singa-pole.

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,066
Singa-pole.

342
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,266
Singa-pole.

343
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,934
-Can I have a massage?
-Sure.

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,066
Interesting thing you've got there.

345
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,033
You.

346
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:44,133
Should I take my clothes off,
or just go like this?

347
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
It's fine just like that, mister.

348
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,533
You're such good friends,
staying for so long.

349
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,700
Right.

350
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:53,967
Ready, mister?

351
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,834
Straight to VIP Treatment?

352
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,967
-VIP Treatment?
-VIP, please.

353
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
VIP Treatment. This is in the way.

354
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,166
Should I take it off?

355
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,200
What should I do with Singa-pole?

356
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,900
What will you do?

357
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,834
I'll leave it to you, ma'am.
What should I do?

358
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,567
The Singa-pole is funny. Leave it on.

359
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,800
I should leave it on? My Singa-pole.

360
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:18,967
Okay.

361
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,967
The lymphatic massage first.

362
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,000
It's not funny.
There is nothing dirty going on here.

363
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,433
Okay.

364
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,467
Macau!

365
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,934
Macau?

366
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
Mac... Macau.

367
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,800
Macau! Macau!

368
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,100
Is that Macau?

369
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,767
Ma... Macau! Macau!

370
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,133
Ma'am!

371
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,433
Ma'am!

372
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,834
Ma'am! Wait! Please!

373
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,367
You'll make me come! Ma'am!

374
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,800
Stop! Ma'am! Seriously, stop!

375
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:02,967
You're seriously making me come!

376
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,967
Seriously! Ma'am...

377
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,233
Stop! Seriously!

378
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,200
I can't come here!

379
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,300
Ma'am, I'll come!

380
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,900
Shut up! You talk too much.

381
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,433
I'm sorry. Hey, ma'am! Don't--

382
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,400
-Singa-pole!
-Singa-pole!

383
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,967
Zakoshi is amazing.

384
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,533
I'm coming!

385
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,734
I'll come, Ma'am!

386
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,767
Ma'am...

387
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:25,066
-I can't hold it.
-If you want to come, do it yourself.

388
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,433
Okay, thank you. Take a shower.

389
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,567
Thank you.

390
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,266
-I'll go home now.
-Unbelievable.

391
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,934
That was unbelievable.

392
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,133
No shower?

393
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,934
-You don't want a shower?
-Well, a shower...

394
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,667
That was close.

395
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,467
Sorry. Can I come in?

396
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,333
Well...

397
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,133
I have a friend.

398
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,033
He performs kabuki,
but someone stole his costume.

399
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,400
What? That's terrible.

400
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,767
And we're looking for it.

401
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:07,667
Can we look here?

402
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:08,734
-Sure.
-It's okay?

403
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,600
It's okay! Come in!

404
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,166
KENJI TAMURA'S HELPER
BIYORI MORIYA

405
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,500
You need it, right?

406
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:22,467
-What does it look like?
-It's for my name-taking ceremony.

407
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,834
-Your big ceremony is today?
-Yes.

408
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,633
-But your costume's gone?
-Yes.

409
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,867
This is not good.

410
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,000
My son's making his debut today too.

411
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:36,100
-That's a big deal.
-He lost his underwear too?

412
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,667
Is this it?

413
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,967
No, it's not.

414
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:40,867
This is bad.

415
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
I didn't take it.

416
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,533
-Really?
-Yeah.

417
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,066
They're filming a documentary
about me for Jounetsu Tairiku.

418
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,033
So what? I didn't take it.

419
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,300
Look all you like.

420
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,300
We're not accusing you of stealing it.

421
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,233
Is that a wart?

422
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,200
Excuse me.

423
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,533
He has a huge wart.

424
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,467
-Excuse me.
-It's a huge wart.

425
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:04,233
-I found these shoes.
-But they're not for my stage.

426
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,834
We found them!

427
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,200
But I'm still missing everything else.

428
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:09,934
-Thanks.
-Are they yours?

429
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,533
I'll wear these for now.

430
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,900
-For some reason...
-Can he tap dance?

431
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,967
For some reason, these shoes...

432
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
They fit me really well.

433
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,633
He has many hobbies.

434
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,667
I wish I'd taken tap dancing lessons.

435
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,400
He didn't take lessons?

436
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,367
The shoes fit perfectly, but...

437
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:36,333
-I wish I'd taken lessons.
-But it looked like he did.

438
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,266
-He's a kabuki performer.
-Really?

439
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,233
-When would he tap dance?
-Well...

440
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,900
Do they tap dance
while striking kabuki poses?

441
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,500
-You have a point.
-Try it.

442
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,033
Hey...

443
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,834
I wish I'd taken tap dancing lessons.

444
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,800
What do you think?

445
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,700
He should take lessons.

446
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,433
He has a wart.

447
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,867
Take a look.

448
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:06,767
What the hell?

449
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:07,800
-Where?
-A wart.

450
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,066
-Where?
-Here.

451
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,300
-Where?
-Here.

452
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,700
-Where?
-Here!

453
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,200
-Where?
-Here!

454
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,867
-Where?
-It's a wart!

455
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:15,800
Where?

456
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:17,734
Here. Right here. It's a wart.

457
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:19,834
-Take a look.
-I did.

458
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,433
Thanks.

459
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,533
He doesn't laugh.

460
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:35,667
-Have that wart taken care of.
-Seriously.

461
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,767
Ten minutes to go.

462
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:48,100
There's not much time left.

463
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:53,934
It's like I said.

464
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,567
-Him again?
-You should just stay retired.

465
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,567
I want to fight.

466
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:01,500
Your punches aren't as powerful as before.

467
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:03,367
I think you should quit.

468
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,367
I want one more chance.

469
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,133
-Check his...
-Should I sit?

470
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,100
I'll sit.

471
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,333
Check his body punches.

472
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,600
I took a few earlier, but they're not
the same as they were in his prime.

473
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm sure they're less powerful, but...

474
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,500
Let's go.

475
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,767
-He's done.
-He's weaker, right?

476
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,967
He's far from being in his prime.

477
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,767
Why do this butt naked?

478
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:32,834
He's not even close.

479
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,066
-He's weaker?
-Much weaker than before.

480
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,700
If you aren't powerful enough
to knock him down...

481
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,233
He's much weaker indeed.

482
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,767
-Me too? Don't do it.
-One, two, three.

483
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,033
-You're too weak to even knock him down.
-Well, that won't make him laugh.

484
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,166
I pooped my pants.

485
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:07,500
Of course, that won't make him laugh.

486
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,967
Is he a pro?

487
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:11,800
Is he a pro?

488
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:12,900
Yes.

489
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:13,967
His punches hurt.

490
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:17,700
-He has world titles in three divisions.
-But that really hurt.

491
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,300
Don't you know him?

492
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,233
-Who is he?
-He doesn't know?

493
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,333
He doesn't know Hozumi Hasegawa?

494
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,433
Really?

495
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,934
-Hello.
-I'm Hasegawa.

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,133
Nice to meet you.

497
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,166
-I don't watch boxing much.
-Let's talk backstage.

498
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,133
What's this?

499
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:45,700
I'm Miko.

500
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,266
Timotei, Timotei

501
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,100
I'm Miko.

502
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,433
He almost lost it there.

503
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,633
So, there's hardly any time left.

504
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,533
Is some kind of accident
the only thing that might get him?

505
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,266
-Bring it on.
-Yeah.

506
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,934
Come on, zombies!

507
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:21,767
No one's coming?

508
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:23,934
What's he doing?

509
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:35,600
-What's all the racket?
-That's scary.

510
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:38,500
-I hear a lot of noise.
-Scary.

511
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,734
You're too noisy.

512
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,467
There are limits to things, you know.

513
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,166
You know?

514
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,967
There are limits.

515
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,133
What's all this noise?

516
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:57,500
Well, yeah,
I think I should get him for that.

517
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:08,000
Well, I'll just give you an orange card
for that.

518
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,000
-He got you a little.
-Yes.

519
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,867
At this stage in the game...

520
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:12,900
This is...

521
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
That's creepy.

522
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,600
-So creepy.
-That is scary.

523
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,700
You're too noisy.

524
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,533
There are limits to things, you know.

525
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:26,367
There are limits.

526
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:28,367
Okay.

527
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,000
-You get an orange.
-Okay.

528
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,233
Five minutes to go.

529
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,400
Okay. Akiyama, let's go.

530
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:35,000
This is not good.

531
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,500
What's he doing?

532
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,500
What the hell?

533
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,734
I'm Miko.

534
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,166
I came from city hall.

535
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,600
I work at city hall,

536
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,000
in the game department.

537
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay.

538
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,066
My social media handle is

539
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,734
JJ.

540
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:30,700
JJ?

541
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm Miko.

542
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,133
You're Miko.

543
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,367
Please call me again.

544
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,433
Okay.

545
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,734
-I'm Miko.
-Okay.

546
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:39,533
-Well...
-Thank you.

547
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,066
-There's no time.
-It was a pleasure.

548
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,834
They're running out of time.

549
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,734
But if they're ready to attack, go for it.

550
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:50,200
We're down to the last three minutes.

551
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:52,934
That was close!

552
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,900
-Akiyama, can you go?
-Or Jimmy.

553
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:57,967
One minute.

554
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,467
They want to make him laugh somehow.

555
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,200
They're trying, but...

556
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:05,266
Hey.

557
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,433
Why don't you try laughing?

558
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,467
-What?
-Why don't you laugh?

559
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,800
I did.

560
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,834
-Laugh more.
-I already did.

561
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,166
-You usually laugh so easily.
-I laughed.

562
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,233
Laugh.

563
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:20,767
I did.

564
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:25,033
What was that?

565
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,233
Is he smiling a little?

566
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,767
My kneecaps!

567
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,767
You'll break my kneecaps!

568
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:04,367
Laugh.

569
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:06,767
My knees will break.

570
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,867
Eat the sushi.

571
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:13,967
It's all dried up.

572
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:15,767
Eat the sushi.

573
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,100
-I did.
-One more.

574
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,300
-One more?
-Yeah.

575
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:19,367
Keep eating.

576
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,166
We'll be back!

577
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
This is the final stretch.

578
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,934
Miko. I'm Miko.

579
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:44,934
You really are too noisy.

580
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,467
I'm Miko.

581
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,533
Right?

582
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,533
Show more consideration
for the people around you.

583
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,900
This really is creepy.

584
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,800
-Are you listening?
-No, no. I'm Miko.

585
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,500
Miko.

586
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:59,500
You really need to start using your head.

587
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:02,100
So, it's almost over. Almost.

588
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,667
-Here we go.
-Please.

589
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,033
Nine.

590
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,433
Eight.

591
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:10,967
Seven.

592
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,834
Six, five...

593
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,667
Four...

594
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:15,734
Three...

595
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:16,967
Two...

596
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:21,633
It's over!

597
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
Is it over?

598
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,567
It is.

599
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,934
It's all over!

600
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:31,967
-I held out!
-You did!

601
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:32,867
I did!

602
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:35,667
-Zakoshi is the champion!
-Thank you!

603
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,033
-He's strong.
-Thank you!

604
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,200
He really did it!

605
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:41,266
Thank you!

606
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,934
When he came at the end,
I didn't know if I could take it anymore.

607
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,467
Well, that was truly amazing.

608
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:48,934
Well done!

609
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,233
Thank you!

610
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,400
I did it! Thank you!

611
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,500
-Thank you!
-He was the strongest.

612
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,166
He was.

613
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:00,967
-It was indisputable.
-Really?

614
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,333
-Indisputable.
-Thanks.

615
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,467
You were too strong.

616
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:08,066
Look! This is 10 million yen.

617
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:11,700
Amazing. It's twice the amount
of the R-1 prize money.

618
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,600
When did you come closest to laughing?

619
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,367
Well, I did laugh.
Zombie Akiyama was funny.

620
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:21,166
There are limits to things, you know.

621
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:23,633
Who wouldn't laugh at that?

622
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:29,600
The other thing was
the toy Eikoh Kano brought.

623
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,567
What the hell are you doin'?

624
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,333
What the hell are you doin'?

625
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,700
It's a tag match!

626
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,100
It's a tag match!

627
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:40,000
That came really close.

628
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:41,834
That was...

629
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:44,900
Right? It repeats everything.

630
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,066
So, I'm the fourth champion?

631
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,567
That's right.
The first season had no winner.

632
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,567
-Right?
-Yes.

633
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:55,300
Oh, yeah!

634
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,000
All right!

635
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:00,800
This is 10 million yen!

636
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,033
But please,
don't break into my house or anything.

637
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,567
Like Topreed. Don't do it.

638
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:13,900
What can I say? Well, it was indisputable.

639
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:20,900
Did you get sweaty palms?

640
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,367
As the show nears the end,

641
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:27,533
you want the survivors to laugh
even more and more.

642
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,867
It's a funny thing.

643
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,033
-He was good at both offense and defense.
-Right.

644
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,667
-He just wouldn't laugh.
-He wouldn't laugh.

645
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,667
Well...

646
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:43,400
We had the former world boxing champion
Hozumi Hasegawa,

647
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,433
but he had no idea who he was.

648
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,300
That lack of knowledge...

649
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,166
That was quite unexpected.

650
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,867
He must have been thinking,
"Who is this guy?"

651
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,967
But even so,
he was always on the offensive.

652
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:04,400
I think he's a true champion,
without doubt.
