1
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:18,085
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:22,490
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,271
-Stop that.
-Are you actually doing that?

4
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,506
What are you doing?

5
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,707
No!

6
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,175
Ouch!

7
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:47,248
The end result was truly wonderful.

8
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,584
Can this third season...

9
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,552
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO

10
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,821
...really surpass that?

11
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,758
Hm. I'm a little worried about that.

12
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,593
SEASON 2 KOTOUGE VS SAITO

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,695
-Bring it on!
-You bring it on!

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,964
Take that!

15
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:08,402
In the end, even those who studied comedy
in different places,

16
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:12,206
when forced into a corner,

17
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:18,012
learned to aim for the eyes
or below the belt.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,313
A BATTLE OF INSTINCTS

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,749
It's no longer a matter of technique.

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,951
I saw that.

21
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,520
AN INCOMPLETE EXPERIMENT

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,657
Throughout Seasons One, Two and Three

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,393
this program has gradually evolved.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,197
For this season, I am really excited
about the new changes in the rules.

25
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,599
Within these six hours

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,470
there will be periods of stalemate.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,205
Until now,

28
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,475
those individuals who received red cards

29
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,510
were eliminated on the spot.

30
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,745
What if we were to leave them in?

31
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,315
They can no longer win.

32
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,883
A SECOND CHANCE FOR THE LOSERS

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,918
They will stay on as zombies.

34
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:58,919
REVENGE AS ZOMBIES

35
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,690
They will only be there
to make the others laugh.

36
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,258
Until now, we had been sending them home

37
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,660
without them having used
  all of their weapons.

38
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,897
As a zombie,
  you can make use of all you've prepared.

39
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,500
It is going to be very difficult
to win like this.

40
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:17,071
CONSTANT EXPLOSIONS

41
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,641
A COMEDY LABORATORY

42
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,011
There is this prevailing feeling
that our sense of comedy

43
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:27,147
is better than that of those
who don't watch  Documental.

44
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,282
A SECRET AMAZON PARTY

45
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,552
In some ways, this feels underground.

46
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,990
It feels like we are the only ones
  who know about this.

47
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,092
It's like we're undercover documentarians.

48
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,227
GROWING MORE HIDDEN DOCUMENTARIANS

49
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,232
I absolutely cannot show this program
to my daughter.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,969
I'm gradually becoming
more and more convinced of this.

51
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,437
At least, that's how I feel.

52
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,979
I heard on the radio the other day
  that you need more than just fluids

53
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,315
to prevent heat stroke.
  I heard that salt was also important.

54
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,784
This surprised me. Did you know that?

55
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:15,689
That being said,
  I would like to offer you an invitation.

56
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,392
Could you prepare one million yen

57
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,661
and gather at a designated location?

58
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,997
I shall reinitiate Documental.

59
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,936
I have prepared a reward
  of 10 million yen for the winner.

60
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,405
Of course, participation is voluntary.

61
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,641
For those of you who wish to participate,

62
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:37,277
I shall inform you
  of the time and location.

63
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,513
I await your reply.

64
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:43,384
I wish you a splendid summer.

65
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,219
Sincerely, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

66
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:50,124
THE PARTICIPATING COMEDIANS ENTER

67
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:08,976
Wow.

68
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,378
I'm the first to arrive.

69
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,453
He has no idea
  who the other nine people are.

70
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,554
Okay.

71
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,755
-Right.
-Over there.

72
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,159
It must be odd to be the first one.

73
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,995
Hello. I am Kendo Kobayashi.

74
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,633
It came!

75
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,469
What should I do?

76
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,337
Documental.

77
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:41,375
Kobayashi is really well-rounded,
you know?

78
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,178
He knows how to give quick,
  funny answers when prompted.

79
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:48,982
He can also tell funny stories
  and do one-man sketches.

80
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,985
AN EMPEROR WITHOUT A CROWN

81
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,922
Mr. Matsumoto invited me.

82
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,592
He did try to kill me once. He did.

83
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,929
He is also good at dirty jokes.

84
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,199
A MERCILESS PERVERT

85
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,335
I am considering circumcising myself.

86
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,339
I would have to fit him in my bag,

87
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,042
so I looked for a very flexible surgeon.

88
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,845
However, I had to give up in the end.

89
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,047
He is very stable.

90
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,683
He also has plenty of moves up his sleeve.

91
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,252
I see him as being very strong.

92
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,424
Under normal circumstances, I believe that

93
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,894
it would be best not to show
this sort of competition to an audience.

94
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,463
It's that sort of battle.

95
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,999
This is like a free-for-all
  wrestling match.

96
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,201
I want to give it a shot.

97
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,237
If I do what I always do,

98
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,873
I think this will work out quite nicely.

99
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,089
What?

100
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,291
That's surprising.

101
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,128
It is surprising.
I didn't expect him either.

102
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,198
-I see someone really funny sitting here.
-Terumoto Goto?

103
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,704
I am Terumoto Goto
of the Football Hour comedy group.

104
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,377
All I can say is that I will do my best.

105
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,345
I will do all that I can.

106
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,884
Excuse me.

107
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,420
Huh?

108
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,594
Isn't this a program
for comedians who act silly?

109
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:44,598
Or at least,
for those capable of acting silly?

110
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,099
Right?

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,969
Goto has the ability

112
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:52,639
to observe everything
in a very objective way.

113
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,976
I see him as being an observant comedian.

114
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,113
If you receive this invitation,
you have no reason to decline, right?

115
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,815
There are plenty of reasons to decline
because of the dough.

116
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,117
This isn't about the money.

117
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,056
How will he control the events?

118
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,391
I think that he will be able

119
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,094
to draw a lot from the other performers.

120
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,196
COMEDY SNIPER

121
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,266
I haven't had this feeling
  in a very long time.

122
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:23,303
It's not something I can experience
  on other shows.

123
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,039
I'm feeling nervous.

124
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,742
He can work fine on his own as well.

125
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,846
I think it will be interesting to see
  a side of him that we don't see on TV.

126
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,048
When I work on variety TV shows,

127
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,985
I go there for the purpose of laughing.

128
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,855
This is the exact opposite
  of what I usually do.

129
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:46,426
I usually think about the next bit
  while laughing at the previous one.

130
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,229
I cannot do that here.

131
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,731
That's painful.

132
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,933
Everything could end in a moment.

133
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,437
I want to be able to attack
  at every opportunity.

134
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,841
Those are all the props.

135
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,977
Really? That's it?

136
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,580
That, plus whatever we bring here.

137
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:07,814
Really?

138
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,593
Hello.

139
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,128
He's here.

140
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,563
Oh, well...

141
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,399
Seriously?

142
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,501
-Damn!
- Of course they're not pleased.

143
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
Damn it!

144
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,704
Of course they're not pleased
  with the situation.

145
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,105
-Did I surprise you?
-What?

146
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,978
I am Ryuji Akiyama
from comedy group Robert.

147
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:42,349
I have decided that I will definitely
be taking home that 11 million yen.

148
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,051
Excuse me.

149
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:47,955
Hello.

150
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:52,092
This program always had a place
right here.

151
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,661
I want to participate.

152
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,131
He will be a tough opponent.

153
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,002
His comedy is highly effective

154
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,938
against both newcomers
  and fully-seasoned comedians.

155
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:08,608
He can get laughs both
  through direct and indirect means.

156
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,244
I'm a little afraid of Akiyama.

157
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,782
THE MAN OF A THOUSAND CHARACTERS

158
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,251
He can also act.

159
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,220
It is almost unfair.

160
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:30,163
You told me about that Detox For Men.

161
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,833
What are you talking about now?

162
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,568
I just can't get a reservation.

163
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:38,171
This is not the place to bring up
aromatherapy salons in Shinbashi.

164
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,942
Why are you bringing that up here
of all places?

165
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,078
I felt that I needed to do this.

166
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,447
I can't run away from this.

167
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,218
Akiyama?

168
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,688
You're already making me laugh.

169
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,224
When the time comes to go naked,

170
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,061
how can I get laughs with my groin?

171
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,864
I bought some really expensive drinks
  to enhance my vitality.

172
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,734
I do think that there is a higher level
  in naked comedy.

173
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,106
-That door really seems important.
-Right.

174
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,509
We need to be careful around that.

175
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,417
I guess you can use it at your own timing.

176
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,222
I see.

177
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,425
That makes sense.

178
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,692
Right.

179
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,630
Right. It would be odd
if Kinoshita didn't turn up.

180
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,265
Here's the first player from Shochiku.

181
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,769
Hello. I am Takayuki Kinoshita
from the TKO comedy group.

182
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,738
I am a member
of the Shochiku comedy agency.

183
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,039
Invitation?

184
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,208
Really?

185
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,144
"Welcome to  Documental."

186
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,480
This is an honor.

187
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,250
They worked so hard.

188
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,187
Can't I bring Moriwaki?

189
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,623
This time,

190
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,892
there are a lot
of rather plump competitors.

191
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,797
This may be surprising, but

192
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,468
I think Kinoshita has a decent chance
of winning.

193
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,404
He does laugh fairly easily.

194
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,040
But if he avoids
having certain buttons pushed,

195
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,175
I think that he can survive for a while.

196
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,212
There is a certain madness in his comedy.

197
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,248
TRUE BALD ACTOR

198
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,150
I waited for this.

199
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,954
For those who live as comedians,

200
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,724
this is a festival of sorts.

201
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,827
That being the case, I cannot refuse.

202
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,296
This is the program I both want to
  and don't want to appear on the most.

203
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,033
This program reveals
  the true capabilities, skills

204
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,537
and techniques
  of the people participating.

205
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,973
Among my comedian friends,

206
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,642
this program comes up a lot.

207
00:12:56,176 --> 00:13:00,180
What could you do if it were you?

208
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,217
We would hold
  our own personal Documentals.

209
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,853
Kinoshita's face is really powerful.

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,923
You're all well-known for your silly gags.

211
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,691
You're right. That's...

212
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,467
No, no. That may be, but...

213
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,539
-Here he comes.
-Hello.

214
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,742
-There are a lot of huge guys.
-Seriously.

215
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,777
How many props are in that bag?

216
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,412
Isn't this amazing?

217
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,780
Look at Kasuga's bag.

218
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,151
What is with that guy?

219
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,755
I am Kasuga of the comedy group Audrey.

220
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,424
Right now,

221
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm really looking forward to this.

222
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,629
MUTSUMI MANOR

223
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,498
Hello.

224
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,066
Hello.

225
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,168
What? It came.

226
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,870
It finally came.

227
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,172
This is wonderful.

228
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,440
Yeah.

229
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,911
Did you pick out that vest just for today?

230
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,947
That's right. This is a little brighter.

231
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,250
-This is a formal event.
-The material is different.

232
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,520
Kasuga has the ability
to skillfully cut through the noise,

233
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,589
find the best timing,

234
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,092
and get the laughs all for himself.

235
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,401
He gets very intense

236
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,070
regarding money.

237
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,974
I think he will play very conservatively.

238
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,410
A BIZARRE THRIFTY MONSTER

239
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,846
This is really important to me.

240
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,781
I put it in a safe.

241
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,583
I want it to be secure.

242
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,652
This safe

243
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,589
also fits 11 million yen.

244
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,891
On variety shows,

245
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:55,462
I do smile and laugh a lot.

246
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,398
But I have never laughed

247
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,667
outside of my character as Kasuga.

248
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:04,204
Kasuga was really interested to see
  what would happen

249
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,339
if Kasuga appeared on this program.

250
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,210
Kasuga really wants to watch Kasuga
on that show.

251
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,746
I don't get that.

252
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,548
I have never used an outfit to get laughs.

253
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:16,950
That's true.

254
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,385
I thought about it.

255
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,154
If you don't get laughs,
you just go home depressed.

256
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,828
But I thought about that a lot.
Would pro comedians laugh at this?

257
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,796
Right.

258
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,765
Some things won't work.

259
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,137
Wow.

260
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,171
Always troublesome

261
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,939
I was worried about you.

262
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,675
This is bad.

263
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,311
His comedy is my biggest weakness.

264
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,745
What is that?

265
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,315
-Take that hoodie off.
-This is a normal hoodie.

266
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,616
That is not normal.

267
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,051
This is my hoodie.

268
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,353
What is he wearing?

269
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,991
Hello, I'm Kukky
of the Yaseibakudan comedy group.

270
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,427
I am not cheap.

271
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,896
I am not cheap.

272
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,865
-Hello.
-Hello.

273
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,233
Good work.

274
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,104
This is the second time.

275
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,305
For me.

276
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,074
This is my second time.

277
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:18,211
While he will leave an impression,

278
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,947
he won't be winning.

279
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,553
WALKING THE TIGHTROPE
OF THE BROADCAST LAWS

280
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,689
Quite a chubby group.

281
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,092
-We're all big.
-Another big one.

282
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,662
If I had to compare him,
he is similar to Jimmy in style.

283
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,099
But he will laugh at nothing.

284
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,268
It makes you wonder what was so funny.

285
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,771
He could be out fairly quickly.

286
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,172
The last time,

287
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,509
everything felt condensed.

288
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,511
Even mentally.

289
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,115
It was like garlic egg yolk.

290
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,916
It was that condensed.

291
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,055
THE ULTIMATE WEAPON

292
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,957
You're all top comedians, I see.

293
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,592
This should be fun.

294
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,527
Who is top?

295
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,030
Mr. Matsumoto may have turned gay
if he wants so many big guys together.

296
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,701
I have begun to think that

297
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,605
comedy and fear
are two sides of the same coin.

298
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,174
I am thinking about trying to attack

299
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,710
that fear portion of it.

300
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,746
Mr. Matsumoto ended up choosing

301
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,516
a lot of muscular men.

302
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,651
All muscular men. He really did turn gay.

303
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,225
He's really tough.

304
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,895
I'm not tough. I laughed right away.

305
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,130
When I saw the first season,

306
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,899
he made me laugh a lot.

307
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,104
Another big one.

308
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,907
-Hello.
-Hello.

309
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,608
-RG.
-Hello.

310
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,345
I'm RG of the Razor Ramon comedy group.

311
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm really excited about this.

312
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,953
A  Documental observation?

313
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,024
I will use the melody
of this Italian lullaby.

314
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,694
A Documental observation

315
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,997
That is what I will tell you

316
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:22,368
Santa Lucia

317
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,705
In Documental, there are

318
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,609
A lot of comedians with shaved heads

319
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,180
THE ATTACK
OF THE OBSERVATIONAL HUMOR SINGER

320
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,783
I think that RG

321
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,652
has a lot of jokes

322
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,555
that he can't say on TV.

323
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,157
If he throws them out here,

324
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,493
I think he has the potential

325
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,895
to be very destructive.

326
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,098
He also has a strong heart.

327
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,903
He might have the strongest heart
  of the group.

328
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,372
THE IRON HEART OF JAPAN

329
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:03,076
I am who I am because I attack repeatedly.

330
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,644
That's how I was raised.

331
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,481
I will do what I can
  to hold out as long as I can.

332
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,086
I'm thinking of this
  as a pro wrestling ring.

333
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,921
I will make them laugh

334
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,423
and I will take on their moves.

335
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,259
If I can do both of those things,

336
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,761
I think that I will become the champion.

337
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,533
-Only three left.
-Wow. Three more.

338
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,600
Yeah.

339
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,736
Everyone here has the ability
to do something

340
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,105
that will immediately make us laugh.

341
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,111
He brought tissues.

342
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:43,716
Another big one.

343
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,052
You didn't bring anything?

344
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,121
-What?
-He brought tissues.

345
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,657
-That's actually impressive.
-Who do you think you are?

346
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,791
I need to clean my glasses.

347
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,994
What the hell?

348
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,331
I am Mikio Date
of the Sandwichman comedy group.

349
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,333
I will do my best.

350
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,371
What is it? Are you paparazzi?

351
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,006
So this is how you invite people?

352
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,377
I think Tomizawa would be better at this.

353
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,815
I'm going into this with no plan.

354
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,784
I'm not bringing any weapons.

355
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,753
I think something real
  would probably be the funniest.

356
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,728
I expect that

357
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,731
Goto and Date will lead the others.

358
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,833
That's what I think.

359
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,104
BLOND CHATTY PIG

360
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,340
I expect that Date and Goto

361
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,542
will compete for the same position.

362
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,379
That dynamic will greatly affect
the direction of Season Three.

363
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,315
Honestly, this is a show I want to watch.

364
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,085
Not one that I want to appear in.
Just one to watch.

365
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,456
But if my seniors work hard
to crack jokes,

366
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,591
I might feel like I need to laugh.

367
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,294
It would be rude if I didn't laugh, right?

368
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,301
I'll just act natural.

369
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,205
I want to remain until the end.

370
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,774
Everyone is huge.

371
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,676
I know, right?

372
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,545
He put me here
to break up the massive men.

373
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,448
They seem to be getting along.

374
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,384
Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun.

375
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,523
What, why so...

376
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,026
Here he is.

377
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,063
-This is bad.
-This is really bad.

378
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,965
I am a member
  of Yoshimoto Creative Agency.

379
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:41,634
I have been a professional comedian
for 15 years.

380
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:46,072
I am Yoshimasa Iwahashi
of the Plus Minus comedy group.

381
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,411
It's too soon for me.

382
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,846
Absolutely. No question.

383
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,081
A little of this.

384
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,751
The question is which way it will go

385
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,453
when he begins to go mad.

386
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:06,225
COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR

387
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,628
-Are you the straight man?
-Right. I play the straight man.

388
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,596
You are not a straight man.

389
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,031
No, I am the straight man.

390
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,900
People who look like you
aren't straight men.

391
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,502
In my  manzai duo I play the straight man.

392
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,872
When Iwahashi is fired up,
  he can be really funny.

393
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,742
But when he's not, he's not funny at all.

394
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,911
I wonder which Iwahashi will show up?

395
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,747
Will it be plus or minus?

396
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,153
Last month I made 320,000 yen.

397
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:35,988
I have two children.

398
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,157
My wife raises the children.

399
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,193
Our rent is a ridiculous
  180,000 yen a month.

400
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,729
I am willing to die today.

401
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:47,200
I hope this will help me
  step up to the next level.

402
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,570
I hope this shows my strengths.

403
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,905
This is almost like minor league players

404
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,408
batting against major league pitchers.

405
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,376
I want to shatter expectations.

406
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,048
Nine have gathered.

407
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,816
-Another big one.
-That's right.

408
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,851
Everyone is wide.

409
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,987
I think that the last one
  will surprise them.

410
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,023
I think that some of them will be
  meeting him for the first time.

411
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,181
Seriously?

412
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,220
I am Keiichi Yamamoto
of the Gokuraku Tombo comedy group.

413
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,923
Thank you for inviting me here.

414
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,863
I've seen this before.

415
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:53,866
I'm actually honored.

416
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,704
Honestly.

417
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,141
I almost never appear on broadcast TV.

418
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,378
I really appreciate this opportunity.

419
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,981
This is really going to be a surprise.

420
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:09,982
Right?

421
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,418
I really hope that
  he releases everything

422
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:15,121
that has been building up
  for more than ten years.

423
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,691
His balls must be packed.

424
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,863
RESURRECTION OF THE GOLD PIG

425
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:28,401
I have the feeling that
  he's betting a lot on this competition.

426
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:33,206
I do think that he could shine here.

427
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,478
I'm not rusty.

428
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,515
I can't afford to complain
about being rusty.

429
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,219
I will treat this like a presentation.
  I will do my best.

430
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,888
This is a presentation
  for broadcast networks.

431
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,658
So these are the members.

432
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,995
This is very different
from what I expected.

433
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,430
That's right.

434
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,200
It is completely different.

435
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,457
Why did you come with so few props?

436
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,093
Date and Goto didn't bring much.

437
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,362
This is just to clean my glasses.

438
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,631
What is that?

439
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,299
There are tissues here.

440
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,068
-There are tissues, right?
-You can clean them with your shirt.

441
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,570
No. That would make them dirty.

442
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,007
Hey.

443
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,508
Good morning.

444
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,943
Hello.

445
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,279
Hello. Why didn't the last person
close the door?

446
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,647
Now here is a muscular man.

447
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,181
Good morning.

448
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,149
Amazing.

449
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,183
Hello.

450
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,686
Is that a bowling bag?

451
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,087
Are you going bowling?

452
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,222
Amazing.

453
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,189
That is thick.

454
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,692
Well, everyone,

455
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,793
take a seat.

456
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,162
Isn't this an amazing group?

457
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,765
Mr. Matsumoto, there are some suspicions.

458
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:06,699
What?

459
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,101
You've gathered
a brawny group of men here.

460
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,337
-Right.
-You chose us.

461
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,406
There are suspicions
that you have gone gay.

462
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,574
I am thinking
about going in that direction.

463
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,312
-That is scary.
-Wait a minute.

464
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,748
I'm thinking of making the switch
around the time of the Tokyo Olympics.

465
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,216
That's coming up soon.

466
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,786
It was just by chance

467
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,421
that you're all large men.

468
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,090
-Is it really by chance?
-There's no way.

469
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,191
I don't know.

470
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,359
I doubt that.

471
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,027
You can all do tug-of-war.

472
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,096
This is like a tug-of-war competition.

473
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,665
Yamamoto has agreed to join us.

474
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,000
Yamamoto.

475
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,503
Some of you may be meeting him
for the first time.

476
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,373
-That's true.
-This is my first time.

477
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,910
While you were taking time off,
all of these younger comedians broke out.

478
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:51,978
Right.

479
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,014
But I know that Yamamoto will show
that he isn't what you expect.

480
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,382
I have high expectations.

481
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,784
That isn't true at all.

482
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:00,619
Right.

483
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:01,554
Really?

484
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,689
I don't know if I'll be able to prove

485
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,758
that I'm not the man you expect.

486
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,094
That isn't the case at all.

487
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,363
I hope to see you work hard
from the start.

488
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,131
Your eyes are already red.

489
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,734
That looks painful.

490
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,169
I didn't expect to be among these members.

491
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,406
Do I even need to explain the rules now?

492
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,574
We generally know them.

493
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,077
I don't think I need to explain them.

494
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,379
You all brought a million yen.

495
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,947
Iwahashi, were you able to come up
with your million?

496
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:31,283
It was really difficult,
I borrowed it from the CEO in Osaka.

497
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,819
-The CEO in Osaka?
-That's right.

498
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,122
Yes. That was really tough.

499
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,591
-That must have been tough.
-It really was.

500
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,726
But if you win,
you get ten times that amount.

501
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,328
That is true.

502
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:46,132
Can everyone hand over their million yen?

503
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:49,902
Amazing.

504
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,437
But there are plenty of you for whom

505
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,439
losing a million yen
wouldn't hurt that much.

506
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,274
That isn't the case.

507
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,610
This is really painful.

508
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,645
In the last season,
Kotouge wasn't that excited

509
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,447
about winning the 10 million yen.

510
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,915
Seriously?

511
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,450
That isn't true.

512
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,252
It's 10 million yen.

513
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,587
He usually just passed
that amount to Anri.

514
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,223
They're still connected.

515
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,591
It's all connected.

516
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,126
I paid 30,000 yen before.

517
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,028
This is tough.

518
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,229
Well, well.

519
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,232
-What is that?
-One million yen.

520
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,801
What is that?

521
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,369
Why do you have a safe?

522
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,371
You didn't have to go that far.

523
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,406
I thought that was suspicious.

524
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,208
This is a good one.

525
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,644
You don't need to be so subtle
with your jokes.

526
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,612
I wasn't trying to do that.

527
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,147
Just say it normally.

528
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,282
Fine. I got it.

529
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,883
This is to help with the atmosphere.

530
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,385
-Right.
-It's not a bad idea.

531
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,886
Right. Please allow me this.

532
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:42,988
Quit joking around.

533
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,091
Wait a minute.

534
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,993
That has nothing to do with this.

535
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,528
This is really important.

536
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,030
How many props do you have?

537
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,665
A thousand.

538
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,133
I made them myself.

539
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,367
No way.

540
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,869
You just want us to tease you.

541
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,370
What are you talking about?

542
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,939
I'm being serious.

543
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,341
Please pass the cash this way.

544
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,810
You must have had trouble too, Yamamoto.

545
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,680
-It was tough.
-It must've been tough where you are now.

546
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,815
Yes. It was really tough.

547
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,151
Please pass it this way.

548
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,252
Here you go.

549
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,421
This is heavy.

550
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:18,357
This is amazing.

551
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,392
Amazing. 10 million.

552
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,461
Most people have fresh bills this time.

553
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:30,136
But this is a bit ugly.

554
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,671
This will be the prize.

555
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,273
Wow!

556
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,876
Look at that!

557
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,445
Amazing.

558
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,446
I see.

559
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,015
You all donated a million yen
to the prize.

560
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,750
So if you win,
you would only gain nine million yen.

561
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:45,718
Right.

562
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,887
So I will put up the last million.

563
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:48,821
WHOEVER DOESN'T LAUGH
GETS 10 MILLION YEN

564
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:49,722
PLUS MATSUMOTO'S MILLION YEN

565
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,923
Thank you.

566
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,259
Thank you.

567
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,161
That's terrific.

568
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,896
Thank you.

569
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,430
This doesn't bother me at all.

570
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,499
You don't have to say that.

571
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,568
I'm sure that it's true.

572
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,270
That makes sense.

573
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,473
-I'm sure that's true.
-But please be a little more delicate.

574
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,475
-That's right! I almost forgot.
-What?

575
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:10,609
This time...

576
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,312
I created a special rule
for this competition.

577
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,015
You know about the cards, right?

578
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,084
There is yellow and orange.

579
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,855
If you get a red card, you are out.

580
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:26,992
Until now, the people who were out
had to leave.

581
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,296
This time I am establishing
a special zombie rule.

582
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,564
Zombie rule?

583
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,334
Even if you are out,
you may remain as a zombie.

584
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,368
Zombie rule.

585
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,837
When there are some people left,

586
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,739
you can reappear as a zombie,

587
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,275
and make the others laugh.

588
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,844
In other words,
if no one survives the six hours

589
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,413
a no contest will be declared.

590
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,714
Your million yen will be returned to you.

591
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,149
It ends there.

592
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,051
You can get your million yen back.

593
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,053
Right.

594
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,387
That's big.

595
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,023
The zombies can work as a team.

596
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,660
-The zombies can have a meeting.
-That's right.

597
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:06,465
In that way, I think
it will be very difficult to win this.

598
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,769
If you're a zombie,
you're allowed to laugh.

599
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,371
Really?

600
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,939
That's right.

601
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,574
The zombies can laugh.

602
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,976
They're already dead.

603
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,310
They are dead, after all.

604
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,280
I will answer any questions
you might have.

605
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,315
It seems you are all ready.

606
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,418
The six hours will start after this.

607
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,387
Six hours.

608
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,757
You seem to be getting along very well.

609
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,593
You sort of know how this works.

610
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,229
-Well, we've seen this before.
-Right. Right.

611
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,798
This is for 10 million yen.

612
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:40,799
Right.

613
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,334
Amazing.

614
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,702
That is a lot of money.

615
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,571
And we have an amazing group here.

616
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,107
-What is that?
-Amazing group?

617
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,074
Amazing?

618
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,075
Nothing.

619
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,078
I think you will link up together well.
You all want to win.

620
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,480
Right.

621
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,248
That much is certainly true.

622
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:57,616
That's right.

623
00:31:57,683 --> 00:32:00,552
If you aren't funny here,
I will really come down on you.

624
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,289
Please don't do that.

625
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,090
I'll tell people
that you aren't funny at all.

626
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,759
Just from today?

627
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,827
That could be worse than
losing a million yen.

628
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,362
I'll tell my parents too.

629
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,598
-That doesn't bother me.
-That's fine.

630
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:14,900
I am fine with your mother thinking
that I'm not funny.

631
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,835
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm totally fine with that.

632
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:20,105
My mother doesn't really think
that you're that funny to begin with.

633
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,608
Why is that?

634
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,677
Does she hate me?

635
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,147
-Why doesn't she like you?
-I know, right?

636
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,582
Once I leave, it begins.

637
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,418
Are we starting?

638
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,886
That was quick.

639
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,521
There's food over there.

640
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,289
There are all sorts of things.

641
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,925
You can use these props too.

642
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,660
There are a lot.

643
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,395
All sorts of props.

644
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,963
The six hours are absolute.

645
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,367
Depending on you,
this could end in 30 minutes.

646
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,704
We could all lose instantly.

647
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,740
This is amazing.

648
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,742
Good luck.

649
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,877
Shut up.

650
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,412
Shut up.

651
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,648
Shut up.

652
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:03,982
Have fun.

653
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,484
The pressure is too much.

654
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,354
-Why are you trying to vomit?
-I couldn't breathe.

655
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,656
This starts once he hits the button.

656
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:11,990
That's right.

657
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,792
It makes a sound.

658
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,828
-This is scary.
-It is.

659
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,731
I'm going to put away my bag.

660
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,165
Season Three.

661
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,769
Let's get started.

662
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,170
Start.

663
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,375
It started.

664
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,776
All right.

665
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,879
This refrigerator is packed.

666
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,882
-It really is.
-There's plenty of stuff in it.

667
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,417
Amazing.

668
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,121
Water? Oh, water.

669
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,057
There's tons of stuff in here.

670
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,759
There's no water.

671
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,160
There is seltzer.

672
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,062
-There is beer too.
-There was water.

673
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:51,196
Look to the side.

674
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,998
Is it out of water?

675
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:54,833
There's just seltzer.

676
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,602
I don't want seltzer.

677
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,470
I don't drink seltzer either.

678
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,906
I can drink seltzer.

679
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,574
You drank out of that.

680
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,376
That doesn't matter.

681
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,078
Then, I'll drink this one.

682
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,180
Okay.

683
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:09,748
Could you?

684
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,750
This is really starting.

685
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,919
Are we going to waste electricity?

686
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:14,953
Scary.

687
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,257
What now?

688
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,659
-Right.
-I am sorry for yelling.

689
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,162
It started while I was in the locker room.

690
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,963
-Was that a fight?
-No.

691
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,365
It just sounded like one.

692
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,468
Fight?

693
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:30,669
No.

694
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,604
We are allowed to get drinks, right?

695
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,574
-He left the door open.
-I didn't open it.

696
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,176
Who opened it?

697
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,111
Was it Kinoshita?

698
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,381
Are you starting to fight already?

699
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:43,882
Right.

700
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,785
-Fight?
-We aren't fighting. I just scolded him.

701
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,854
They got dirty in my waiting room.

702
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,224
-Are we fighting from the start?
-Fight?

703
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,493
I just scolded him.

704
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,195
Okay.

705
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,164
Where can we smoke?

706
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,099
You can smoke at the table.

707
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,968
-Right there?
-No problem.

708
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:04,970
Are there any ashtrays?

709
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,071
Yes.

710
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,573
That's quick.

711
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,241
You're already going for the ashtrays.

712
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,477
No, I was just wondering
whether there were any ashtrays.

713
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,312
Over there.

714
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,918
Ja!

715
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:22,521
Ja! Ja!

716
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:26,158
Jumping jack!

717
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,470
That is really loud.

718
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,404
Indeed.

719
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,840
Is Kukky all right?

720
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:45,344
He might try to hide

721
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,645
by smoking.

722
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:47,846
Look at Kinoshita.

723
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:49,481
Can you do this?

724
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:50,516
Yes.

725
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,020
That's unbelievable!

726
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,356
-You are really good.
-That's amazing.

727
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,390
You're like a pro.

728
00:35:58,457 --> 00:35:59,458
Wow!

729
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,233
No. What are you doing?

730
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,303
-Why could you do it before?
-Are you good or bad at it?

731
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,873
Your lips are going to turn white
if you blow that hard. Quit that.

732
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:21,647
-It only went well in the beginning!
-What's with that?

733
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,815
Everything.

734
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,384
What does he mean?

735
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,353
-What do you mean by "everything"?
-It's the same as my life.

736
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,894
Where are the ashtrays?

737
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,729
Ashtrays, you said?

738
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,199
-The ashtrays...
  -Yamamoto?

739
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,768
Yamamoto looks suspicious.

740
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,269
-What are you drinking?
-What is that?

741
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,974
-Yamamoto is in a bit of a pickle.
-I found the ashtrays.

742
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,208
Here he comes.

743
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,711
What are you doing?

744
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,814
Be careful.

745
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,082
That's really dangerous.

746
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,420
You're not supposed to drink
too many of those.

747
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,088
What is that?

748
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:05,457
An Exorcism Cola?

749
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:06,892
Erection.

750
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,261
-Are you seeing this?
  -Yamamoto?

751
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,364
Hey!

752
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,499
He is constantly smiling.

753
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,138
Where are the ashtrays?

754
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,707
Are there really none?

755
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,042
Kukky.

756
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,410
He is suspicious.

757
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,714
Who is that?
  Who is the one chewing on something?

758
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,020
Is that good with ice?

759
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,055
Yes.

760
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,123
I see.

761
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,191
Right.

762
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,296
Good.

763
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:46,298
It's looking good.

764
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:47,466
You're good.

765
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,409
Take a look at Yamamoto!

766
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:11,690
A jam session.

767
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,366
A Yakuza boss

768
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,568
Mic percussion.

769
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,438
You have a lot of spots
around your nipples.

770
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,375
I have pretty nipples, right?

771
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,443
You really do.

772
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,378
-The areolas are pink.
-Yes.

773
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,047
-Check them out.
-Look at this.

774
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,982
-It's true.
-I have pretty nipples, right?

775
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,050
Yeah.

776
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:39,651
Please take a look.

777
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:40,952
I'm looking.

778
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,387
They're uneven.

779
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,456
This one has fewer bumps.

780
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,058
I haven't noticed that.

781
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,325
Hot.

782
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:48,760
Hot?

783
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,429
-Hot?
-Don't you mean "Ouch"?

784
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,197
-This one is different.
-I know.

785
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,498
-Right.
-Did you fix it?

786
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,966
-Didn't that hurt?
-They're fixed.

787
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,468
-That fixed them.
-Right.

788
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,303
-They're even now.
-It's true.

789
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,272
-Huh?
-Thank you so much for your help.

790
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,606
That's amazing.

791
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,376
-Are they fixed?
-What did you say?

792
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,711
You are a nipple doctor.

793
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,679
You are a true nipple doctor.

794
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,381
A nipple doctor.

795
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,850
-A nipple doctor. For real.
  -He really looks suspicious.

796
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,318
-Good work.
-Thank you.

797
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,053
Good work.

798
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,588
Where are those ashtrays?

799
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,523
There are no ashtrays.

800
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,158
Thank you.

801
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,127
Look at Yamamoto.

802
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,999
I had no idea

803
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:31,136
You had such beautiful nipples

804
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,575
I am going to get Yamamoto.

805
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:38,643
Who?

806
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,446
Who?

807
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:43,648
Who?

808
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,083
Did someone laugh at that?

809
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,819
-Who is it?
-Did someone laugh at that?

810
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:48,887
Maybe.

811
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,188
That was quick.

812
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:54,893
Who?

813
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:01,066
Around ten minutes have passed
since we started.

814
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,567
Right.

815
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:05,771
Throughout all of those ten minutes or so,

816
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:09,040
Yamamoto has been laughing slightly.

817
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,609
Really?

818
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:11,877
That's terrible.

819
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,245
Constantly.

820
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,813
-He was constantly laughing.
-Were you?

821
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,016
-You were just smiling, right?
-It was like you were at a family reunion.

822
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,885
-Like you normally would.
-You were laughing as if it were normal.

823
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,286
You were smirking the whole time.

824
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,089
As soon as it began,

825
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:27,259
I felt that this room
had a really happy vibe about it.

826
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,827
You're just happy to be working
for the first time in a while.

827
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,028
That's true.

828
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,130
There's no sense of tension in you.

829
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,933
You did seem really nice.

830
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,868
You seemed like a nice man.

831
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,305
You were laughing like a proud father.

832
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,943
I had no idea

833
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,113
You had such beautiful nipples

834
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,387
Add some tension to your face.

835
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,823
-That was the problem?
-Really.

836
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,058
It really is the first time in a while.

837
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,595
I am meeting some people
for the first time in ten years.

838
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,865
So, I couldn't help doing that
when our eyes met.

839
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,801
-It was a form of a greeting.
-Exactly.

840
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,136
I understand that.

841
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,804
But I do have to give you this.

842
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,907
-That is quick.
-So soon!

843
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,709
-That was really quick.
-Wow.

844
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,611
-I understand.
-In ten minutes.

845
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,680
-That's so soon!
-You were constantly smiling.

846
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:22,681
That is true.

847
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,182
I agree. I was smiling.

848
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,984
-I was enjoying myself.
-He was having too much fun.

849
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,018
Please try to maintain
a neutral expression.

850
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,887
-A neutral expression, you say?
-Yes.

851
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,989
-Right.
-Not look like you're laughing.

852
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:33,191
That was quick.

853
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,993
-Yamamoto.
-It really was.

854
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,628
You were using your eyes.

855
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,096
I didn't do anything.

856
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,601
It is true
that you were constantly smiling.

857
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,270
-You told me this was a mint.
-What's the problem?

858
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,571
It's sharp. Touch this.

859
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:47,806
Of course it is!

860
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:56,581
Toos!

861
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,288
Kasu kasu.

862
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,090
-Damn!
-That's definitely the  kasu kasu.

863
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,459
-That's true.
-You're right.

864
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,227
Is that a  kasu kasu dance, Kasuga?

865
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:10,896
Kasu kasu?

866
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:11,963
It is.
