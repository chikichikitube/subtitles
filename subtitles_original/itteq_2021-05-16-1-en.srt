1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,480
"The Quest"

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All girls gather.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,560
"Degawa Girls Gathering Special."

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,560
One day,
we visited Madame at her home.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,440
What will we do this time?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,680
This time, it's the Fourth
Degawa Girls Gathering.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
- Degawa Girls Gathering?
- Yes.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,880
Shouldn't it be
Dewi Girls Gathering? Come on.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,800
We don't want Tetsuro.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,480
Madame will decide the programme
of the girls gathering.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
We can't go abroad now,

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,480
so if we'll go somewhere in Japan,
it would be Iriomote Island.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,440
But the Miyagawa Expedition
has been there.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,040
In the past, Imoto went
to all the places I wanted to go to,

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,560
and lately, Daisuke...

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,480
Sorry.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
They all visit places
I wanted to go to, before me.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,800
But we can do something else,
can't we?

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,000
So their destination
is Iriomote Island.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,760
Madame said
she wanted to go to Iriomote?

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,400
She really has a lot of energy.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,400
It's impressive for an 81-year-old
to want to go to Iriomote.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,880
This time, there's a new Degawa Girl
named Yumena Yanai.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,440
What does she look like?

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
You don't know her?

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
I've neither seen nor met her.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,680
This girl? She looks very healthy.

28
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,400
What will their journey be like?
Stay tuned!

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,360
"This show was broadcasted
on the 16th of May, 2021"

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,600
Welcome to The Quest.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,640
Today's programme is
"Degawa Girls Gathering Special".

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,920
Wasshoi!

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,920
"Morisanchu"

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,160
Hello.

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Hello.

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,480
An Punch.

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
"Madame Dewi"

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,120
Hello, everyone.

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,680
All the girls are here.

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,800
It's the first gathering
after Yumeppe joined.

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,440
Yes, it's the first time.

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,520
I experienced many things
for the first time on this trip,

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,360
so I was excited the whole time.

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
Were you?

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,440
I worried if you were okay,
it made me nervous.

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,640
The old girls...

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
- Hey!
- Don't say that.

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
We were nice.

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,680
She's just like Cinderella.

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,600
The step-mother and evil sisters.

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,800
That's not right!

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,760
Not right?

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,520
I think the old girls
have been treating her well.

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,840
"Treat her well"?

55
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
Is that in a good sense?

56
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
- We didn't bully her.
- The old girls...

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,280
"Degawa Girls Gathering Special"

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Why did my body become like this?

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
Smile more cheerfully!

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,520
Stop it.

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
Come here!

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,040
"Enjoy the natural environment
in Iriomote Island!"

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,080
2,000 kilometres away from Tokyo,

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,360
the six people enjoy the natural
environment to the fullest.

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
Degawa Girls Gathering
in Iriomote Island.

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,480
Iriomote Island is Okinawa's
second largest island.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Most of it is a subtropical forest.

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,960
There are many
rare animals and plants,

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,920
so it's also called
Galapagos of the East.

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,440
We've come to

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,400
Iriomote!

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,000
So this time,

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,720
- Madame wanted to--
- Oh, come on!

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
come to Iriomote Island
no matter what.

75
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,840
That's right,
I've been longing to come here.

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,640
- What's wrong with you?
- Bugs!

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
There are awfully lots of bugs.

78
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
And this place is horrible.

79
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,960
- The opening!
- What happened?

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
That's nothing.
What are you doing, girls?

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,240
And what's surprising is,

82
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,160
there are many bugs
flying around the four girls,

83
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,520
but none come near the two of us.

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,680
Maybe it's because we're poisonous?

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
At Hirai Farm,

86
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,680
Peach Pineapple,
Iriomote's speciality, is grown.

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,600
"Peach Pineapple"

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,640
It's sweet.

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,760
Wow, it's juicy.

90
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,800
It is small,
but it has high sugar content,

91
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,440
one of the expensive pineapples
costs 1,000 yen.

92
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,400
And recently,

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,520
Ms Kawakita just got married!

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Congratulations!

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
So I'm glad that Ms Kawakita
comes here again.

96
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,520
News online says, "Mayuko Kawakita
quits being a Degawa Girl."

97
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Why?

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
Really?

99
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,120
They said, that is why
we have a new Degawa Girl.

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
- It's their imagination.
- How could you!

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,640
Now, Yumeppe, this is the first time
that you meet Madame,

102
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
introduce yourself
in the Fukushima dialect.

103
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
You're Fukushima?

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,280
Fukushima...

105
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,560
Hello, I am Yumeppe.

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,880
Nice to meet you.

107
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
Adorable!

108
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,480
Madame, before Yumeppe
joined The Quest,

109
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,360
she had never even travelled
on a plane.

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,640
The girl is pure.

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,800
Everyone asked Yumeppe,

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,040
"You haven't been abroad?
You haven't been to Hawaii?"

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
Then Ms Kawakita said,

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,480
"Do you know what Hawaii is?"

115
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,360
No, no, no.

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,520
If she doesn't know, she can go
to tropical islands like this.

117
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,720
There isn't any adult
who doesn't know Hawaii!

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,920
I was going to tell her about it.

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
I know what Hawaii is.

120
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,480
She's angry.

121
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,400
Let's go, Degawa Girls Gathering.

122
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,040
First, we'll go river trekking
as Madame wishes.

123
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
There are many rivers
in Iriomote Island,

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,680
and river trekking is popular.

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,720
Mr Nakagawa will be
our experienced guide.

126
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
- Are you our teacher this time?
- Yes.

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,120
Nice to meet you.

128
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
What time did you just say?

129
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,320
- This time.
- Oh, this time.

130
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,000
I thought I heard you say "society."

131
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,800
He'd be dressing wrong
in a ballroom.

132
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,000
That's why I was wondering
what you were talking about.

133
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,560
You don't speak clearly.

134
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,680
Yes, I'm sorry.

135
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
Actually, I have one good news
and one bad news.

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
- What?
- Which one do you want to know now?

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,320
- I want bad news first.
- Bad news first.

138
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
Are you serious?

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,680
- From bad news.
- You guys are on that side?

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,960
Along the way to halfway,

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
there are quite a lot of bugs,

142
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,560
the worst case is leeches.

143
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
- Oh, that.
- What?

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,840
Leeches?

145
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,320
They're all stuck here
before we realise.

146
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
Or they'll enter your nostrils.

147
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,920
"Ahahahahaha"

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,560
Or they'll go inside
your clothes here.

149
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,520
- Go inside your top.
- Inside your mouth.

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
They'll go in from your back.

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
You're a hole and they'll go inside.

152
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,080
You're a hole and they'll go inside.

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,800
And the good news is,

154
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,120
the Okugeta Waterfall
to which they'll go this time,

155
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,920
is an unusual place where even most
of the locals haven't been to.

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,320
Its beauty is guaranteed.

157
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,880
They go to the jungle
and towards the waterfall.

158
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,040
If you realise there's a leech
on your skin,

159
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
don't remove it by hand.

160
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
You'll bleed, right?

161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Can we use that for our show?

162
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
Of course.

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
Then you're okay with it?

164
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,960
Really, she has grown stronger.

165
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,360
If there's a miracle
and I get stung by one.

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,920
It'll be a good story.

167
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,640
You talk like you want to be stung.

168
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
No.

169
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,120
They finally enter the jungle.

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,480
Wow, I love places like this.

171
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,760
- Someone said she loves it.
- Lovely!

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,240
Someone crazy is here.

173
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,080
Don't call her crazy.

174
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,840
Mr Nakagawa tells them to pay
attention to something important.

175
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,840
For the next 10 minutes
in this forest,

176
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,080
you'll see many of this plant.

177
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,520
If you grab it and break the leaf,

178
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,640
- it oozes a white liquid.
- Okay.

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,560
If it sticks on mucous membranes,
like your lips or eyes,

180
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,600
you must be sent
to the hospital immediately.

181
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,320
What?

182
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,080
Also, there's a river
in front of them.

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
I have to get wet?

184
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
- I'll get wet right away?
- Be brave and get wet.

185
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,560
There'll be water
in the whole journey.

186
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh, is that what this trip is?

187
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Mr Degawa, be careful.

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,800
Wow, I'm scared. It's...

189
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,040
- Mr Degawa, you'll touch it!
- Watch out!

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,040
- Watch out!
- That was close.

191
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,080
- Oh, stop it!
- Mr Degawa!

192
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,520
The mic isn't waterproof.

193
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,520
Is it slippery?

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
No, you can do it.

195
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,920
- It's shallow.
- I didn't get wet at all.

196
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,480
Really? I'm soaking wet.

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,960
I've had enough! Hurry!

198
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,520
- Guys, don't fall!
- Wait a minute!

199
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,200
Wait, Yumeppe, don't fall!

200
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,880
Is that a cue?

201
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
"Hahahahaha"

202
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
She's laughing.

203
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
- Laughing.
- She's broken.

204
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,200
Watch out.

205
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,600
While Degawa and the young girls
are screaming,

206
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,640
the 81-year-old Madame
is the best walker among them.

207
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,080
But I'm starting to feel good.

208
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,760
Then, the girls see the thing
they hate in front of them.

209
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
It startled me!

210
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,280
What the heck?

211
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
The microphone!

212
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,720
The microphone.

213
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,200
Microphone!

214
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Worry about Mayuko, not the mic!

215
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,240
She did that fantastic reaction,
don't worry about the mic first.

216
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,760
Exactly.

217
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,400
The mic is expensive.
It's 300,000 yen.

218
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,720
But I think the way I fell
was great.

219
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,080
It was worth 300,000 yen.

220
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Let's go.

221
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
Please wait a second.

222
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,920
Madame.

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
- I'll leave you behind.
- We're a team.

224
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,160
They walk for another 30 minutes.

225
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Be careful.

226
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,120
Oh, here we are, here we are,
here we are.

227
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
They finally see a waterfall
in front of them.

228
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,920
But this isn't their destination.

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
We'll climb up there on the left.

230
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
What?

231
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
Can we go there?

232
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,920
That's right. They need to climb up

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,800
for 20 more minutes
to arrive at Okugeta Waterfall.

234
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,400
They've been here for an hour,

235
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,920
the 81-year-old isn't tired at all.

236
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
Impressive!

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm exhausted.

238
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
A good walker.

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,880
No wonder she wanted to do
river trekking.

240
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
And finally...

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
Wow, beautiful!

242
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,840
Amazing!

243
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,400
Amazing!

244
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm touched.

245
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,440
This is the stunning scenery
known only to a few,

246
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,040
Okugeta Waterfall.

247
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,240
It is about 15 metres tall.

248
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,240
Waterfall in steps like this
is rarely seen in Japan,

249
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
and if you look
at the opposite side...

250
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,680
Wow, beautiful!

251
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
I can see the sea.

252
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,120
It's the beautiful Sea of Iriomote.

253
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
It's a spot with a stunning view,

254
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,560
where you can admire
a waterfall and the sea together.

255
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
Wow, it's here!

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,680
The scenery is absolutely amazing.

257
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,440
- This is picturesque, Madame.
- Yeah.

258
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,920
Can our viewers feel it?

259
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,320
We spent a long time in the jungle,

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
then we see this
after we climbed up.

261
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,800
Ms Kawakita, look at the other side.

262
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,760
Wow, amazing!

263
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,320
It's awesome.

264
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,520
See? Everyone looks here first,
and goes, "Amazing!"

265
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Akane, take that off,
turn around and look.

266
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,320
Wow, it's awesome!

267
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
Look, Maria.

268
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,760
Isn't that amazing? Look behind you.

269
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,000
Huh? What?

270
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,840
Each person feels differently.

271
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,600
Come, Yumeppe.

272
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,000
- It's amazing, right?
- Yes!

273
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,800
But Yumeppe, look to the other side.

274
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,520
Finally, they'll take a photo
for their calendar.

275
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,320
I hate getting soaking wet!

276
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,480
Stop complaining, just do it!

277
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,800
We'll take a photo of them six
standing on the waterfall steps.

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Smile!

279
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,520
I'm smiling!

280
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,080
Smile more cheerfully, guys!

281
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,280
Smile!

282
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,920
"Wahaha"

283
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,320
It's a wonderful photo
with the six of them.

284
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,840
The flow of water
looks mysterious in it.

285
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,960
Tonight's hotel is...

286
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,280
Wow, amazing.

287
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,640
- Lovely.
- What happened?

288
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
This is Hoshino Resorts
Iriomote Hotel.

289
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,200
Iriomote Island aims to get
registered as a World Heritage,

290
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
so it's environmentally friendly.

291
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,240
They discontinued the use
of disposable amenities,

292
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,720
and provide rental
of water bottles.

293
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Their hospitality
is environment-friendly.

294
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Open sesame.

295
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,240
They'll stay in this room.

296
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,840
Wow, it's big!

297
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,240
This is the Luxury Twin Room
with a day bed.

298
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,400
It costs 40,000 yen per night.

299
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,920
This is bigger than my home.

300
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,120
Really.

301
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,680
I think the best part is--

302
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,320
- That one, right?
- Yes, that.

303
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,240
I know.

304
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,560
Come, Yumeppe, lie down here.

305
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,560
Bask in the sun here.

306
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,760
Is it okay to bask in the sun here?

307
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,880
I'll lie down.

308
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,480
"Ahaha"

309
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,360
She's adorable.

310
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,720
Okay, it's okay to lie down.
You can lie down.

311
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
- Do this?
- Yes.

312
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,400
The time this smile turns into
a fake one will come someday.

313
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,480
Stop it!

314
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
It won't, right?

315
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,760
We have some bad news for them.

316
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Only Madame and Mr Degawa
can stay here today.

317
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,960
No.

318
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,640
Degawa Girls aren't united enough,

319
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,680
so you'll stay at a campsite
to get to know each other better.

320
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,000
Hey.

321
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
Campsite?

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,160
I've been doing this
for seven, eight years and finally,

323
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,560
I can stay at hotels
like the ones in Dubai,

324
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,480
but I have to start from scratch
after Yumeppe joined?

325
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,840
What is this?

326
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,680
It's all Yumena's fault.

327
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,360
And this is the campsite.

328
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,280
What?

329
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,440
What's this?

330
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,440
This isn't for people to stay in.

331
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,960
This is Mitrea Campsite.

332
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,560
- It costs 2,000 yen per night,
- It looks nicer now.

333
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,360
The view from the campsite
is its selling point.

334
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,760
They check their rooms at once.

335
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
I see.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,080
It's very simple.

337
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,600
You have one room each.

338
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
We can have one each?

339
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,360
One each?

340
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,880
This isn't right, this isn't right!

341
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,160
What do you think, Yumena?

342
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
It looks a bit fun.

343
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,240
That's not right.
Your perception isn't right.

344
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,680
Do you remember the hotel?

345
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,120
We came here
after going to that hotel.

346
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,680
At the same time,
the elderly team...

347
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,160
- I'm jealous.
- Elderly team.

348
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
Delicious.

349
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,920
Wow, Madame, this is amazing!

350
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
What a feast!

351
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,880
A lot of food ingredients
unique to Iriomote were used

352
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,520
to make the luxurious meal.

353
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,320
Chachacha...

354
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,960
Tatata...

355
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,960
Madame is delighted.

356
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,120
- It's tender.
- Right?

357
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,440
What do you think about
the new member Yumeppe?

358
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,720
Isn't it nice?

359
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,360
When a girl
who is totally different joins,

360
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
it's refreshing.

361
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,280
Do you think Akane has changed,
Madame?

362
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
She became a bit sophisticated.

363
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,760
Ms Kawakita got married, right?

364
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,680
What do you think?

365
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,320
They dated for seven years
and didn't get fed up,

366
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,800
so they must really love each other.

367
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,440
Madame, can you love someone
for so long?

368
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,920
The President told me
every single second

369
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,640
that he loved me, he loved me.

370
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,520
I was happy and blessed as a woman.

371
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
That's why I had no idea
he cheated on me.

372
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,760
Cheated.

373
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,920
He cheated on you!

374
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,600
At the same time, Degawa Girls...

375
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
Have you gotten used
to being a Degawa Girl?

376
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,480
Gradually, things like
the arrangements...

377
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
"Arrangements."

378
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,840
I'm impressed to see how you create
highlights for yourselves.

379
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,400
Highlights!

380
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,280
Don't call it a highlight!

381
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,000
I do it naturally.

382
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,240
It's the first time you meet Madame,
right?

383
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,440
I was so worried that
Madame would not like me.

384
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,840
Why?

385
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,600
I think she stares at people
and can sense something.

386
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,240
In a way you haven't seen before,
Madame is going to...

387
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,840
shout.

388
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,400
She enters the mode suddenly
when she snaps.

389
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,080
To make things worse,

390
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,360
she'd tell you to do something,

391
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,480
then she'll go, "You!"

392
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,600
She'll go, "You!"

393
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,760
It really makes all of us tremble.

394
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,520
Then, the topic changes
to nice stories about Degawa.

395
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Playing the rich lady character
makes me feel very inferior,

396
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
so Mr Degawa told me
to turn it into comedy.

397
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,480
He said that to me a lot,

398
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,160
then I stopped fearing anything.

399
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
Is it a good or a bad thing?

400
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,760
I was working as a model
when I started this,

401
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,720
I didn't like being teased at first.

402
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,320
But Mr Degawa told me
that people tease me out of love,

403
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,960
so I thought, he was right.

404
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,040
I started to feel grateful
for being teased.

405
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,440
He told me I can just be myself.

406
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,840
It made me instantly realise that,

407
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,480
and his words helped me a lot
after that.

408
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,440
He said the same thing to everyone.

409
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,720
- To sum up.
- In general.

410
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,720
It's copy and paste.

411
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,840
Copy and paste...

412
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,520
We realised.

413
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I thought that he said what the girl
needed to hear,

414
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,120
but he said the same things to us.

415
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Like saying that
would hit home anyway.

416
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,160
This is the end of day one.

417
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Madame, I'm impressed.

418
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,200
Didn't you get tired to go that far?

419
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,200
Not at all.

420
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
I could've gone even further.

421
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,480
- You're 81 years old.
- It's so impressive.

422
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,040
Well, they just talked about it,

423
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,520
Madame's voice is very loud
when she snaps.

424
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,840
When she actually snaps, it's...

425
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
"You!"

426
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah, when we're at the counter
in the airport, she really...

427
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,760
- Really.
- No way.

428
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,320
Just go and film outside
with her once.

429
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,760
It's true.

430
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,120
Even when we told Madame
she'd better not be so loud,

431
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,880
she goes, "It doesn't matter!"

432
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,280
She doesn't care
when she is in that mode.

433
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
That's what they say.
What do you think?

434
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,280
- Well, that happens.
- That happens?

435
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
Day two of filming.

436
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,000
They go to a mangrove
with a stunning view.

437
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,760
A mangrove is

438
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,320
a general term for plants that grow
near the mouth of a river

439
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,960
where sea water
and river water mix.

440
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,920
70 percent of mangroves in Japan
are here on Iriomote Island.

441
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
Indeed, there are a lot.

442
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
It's all of that.

443
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,520
It's so beautiful.

444
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
Is that called a mangrove?

445
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,200
I knew it. I was thinking
why you were quiet.

446
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,040
You've been observing.
You didn't say anything.

447
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,040
Yumeppe, do you know
what a mangrove is?

448
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't.

449
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,880
I only know Mitz Mangrove.

450
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,080
Oh, how cute.
There are many little ones.

451
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,880
So cute.

452
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
Did you bring a camera, AYA?

453
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,920
Take photos.

454
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,880
They do this every time.

455
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,720
Madame always gets angry and goes,

456
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,600
"AYA, take photos properly!"

457
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,760
"AYA! Take the photos here!"

458
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,240
When she said, "AYA!"

459
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,320
AYA finally said,
"I'm here to do makeup for you!

460
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm not your photographer!"

461
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,920
She fought back once.

462
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,640
"Makeup is a part of photography!"

463
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,040
What?

464
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,200
Isn't photography
also doing makeup?

465
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,360
Is it the opposite?

466
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,040
That makes AYA a photographer.

467
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,920
Why don't you carry a camera
with you?

468
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,400
- I'm carrying one.
- Yeah?

469
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,520
You startled me.

470
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
- I panicked.
- What?

471
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,280
I panicked.

472
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,880
- What's that?
- It startled me!

473
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,680
- I thought a crocodile appeared!
- I thought so too!

474
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,120
Gosh, cut it out!

475
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,800
They'll go kayaking
as Madame wishes,

476
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,720
but as they're here...

477
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,560
We'll make it a race.

478
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
A race?

479
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,400
The rule is simple.

480
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,640
Three teams of two
will have a kayak race.

481
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,440
The last team will stand under
a waterfall as punishment.

482
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,360
How will they decide the teams?

483
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
The person who wins
a rock, paper, scissors game

484
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
will choose a teammate.

485
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,880
I have to win.

486
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,200
We'll choose.

487
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,320
I see.

488
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,640
The first winner is...

489
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Hotta.

490
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,240
I'll choose Yumeppe.

491
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,040
Thank you!

492
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,960
Now, the fateful match.

493
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,360
Who will win?

494
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,600
Rock, paper, scissors!

495
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Kawakita wins.

496
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,160
I won!

497
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Winning rock, paper, scissors
means nothing.

498
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,040
It means something! I'll choose!

499
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,440
Who will she choose?
Degawa or Tani?

500
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,320
I'll choose Maria, of course!

501
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,400
- Hurray!
- We're going to win.

502
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,360
Hurray!

503
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,920
Thank goodness!

504
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,480
The good ones among us have to be
Yumeppe and Madame.

505
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,880
- Why?
- Madame's arms are very strong.

506
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,840
Are you guys stupid?

507
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
He's only a weight.

508
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,920
Who are you calling a weight?

509
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,000
Who is a weight?

510
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
What's your average age?

511
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
"81 years old, 57 years old"

512
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,680
Their average age is about 70.

513
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,040
Now, let's begin the kayak race.

514
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
The distance is 200 metres.

515
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,760
The team that arrives at the goal
that is the pier, wins.

516
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,160
Ready,

517
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,520
start!

518
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,480
Right, left, right, left.

519
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,680
They all started together.

520
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,960
But Team Kawakita
started to slow down.

521
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,080
You can do it.

522
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,480
Then, they suddenly changed
direction and went to the middle.

523
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,400
- You're in our way.
- You play dirty!

524
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Right, left.

525
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,920
This time,
Team Hotta goes near Degawa.

526
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,200
Akane, don't come here!

527
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,920
Why are you coming here?

528
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
Right, left, right...

529
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,280
It becomes a triple dead heat.

530
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
Ouch!

531
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
They use the paddles
to shove each other.

532
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,280
Team Hotta is in the lead now.

533
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,200
Good!

534
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,680
Team Kawakita is also catching up.

535
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,000
There are 50 metres left,

536
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,160
they can see the pier, their goal.

537
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,200
Team Hotta and Yumeppe
are in the lead,

538
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,000
Kawakita and Tani
are in second place.

539
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,040
At this rate, Degawa and Madame
will go to the waterfall.

540
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,640
They'll be the winner
when they go up the pier.

541
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,560
Good.

542
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,520
You okay?

543
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,880
The girls are struggling.

544
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
Yumeppe can't go up.

545
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,920
Team Kawakita doesn't miss
the chance.

546
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,160
So the last team
is Team Madame and Degawa.

547
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,800
You all came to bump into us.

548
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,120
You bumped into us!

549
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,680
How dare you say that!

550
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
It's a race, so it's okay if we win.

551
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,640
By the way, my team won.

552
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,720
The 81-year-old poked
someone's bottom with her paddle.

553
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,080
Also, when a junior is in trouble,

554
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,840
these sisters-in-law
didn't help her.

555
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
So the winners go to the hotel,

556
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,960
the losers go to the waterfall.

557
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,720
It takes 30 minutes to walk on
a mountain path to the waterfall.

558
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
The girls have free time now?

559
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
They must be having fun.

560
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,760
- Probably now, Madame,
- Are you kidding me?

561
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,320
They must be back at the hotel
having lunch after swimming.

562
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh, is that so?

563
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,360
Come here!

564
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,800
The girls are enjoying
the beautiful beach.

565
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,320
I would be happy
if I see a wild cat here.

566
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
- Indeed.
- Right?

567
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,280
Then the girls will be disappointed.

568
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,440
They will reflect
on what they did wrong.

569
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,640
Really, really.

570
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,160
We can scatter some biscuits.

571
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,920
"Do not do that"

572
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,680
That was the most horrible comment.

573
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,840
Madame, that was
the most horrible comment.

574
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
Was it?

575
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,160
After walking for 30 minutes,

576
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,840
finally...

577
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,520
Isn't it wonderful?

578
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,280
- It's huge!
- Beautiful.

579
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,320
This is the Nara Waterfall,
which is about 25 metres tall.

580
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,040
It's beautiful,

581
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,600
- but it's rather powerful.
- Yes.

582
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm trembling with excitement.

583
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,440
Anyway, brace yourself
when we're under the waterfall.

584
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,360
Please go.

585
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,840
After you.

586
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,080
Senior, after you.

587
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,640
You're a man.

588
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Senior, after you.

589
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
You really play dirty.

590
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,040
They go into the waterfall.

591
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,880
I can't see ahead.

592
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,920
Madame goes after Degawa.

593
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
That's the guts of an 81-year-old.

594
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,560
Amazing.

595
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,120
They start sitting
under the waterfall.

596
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,080
Go a bit more to the front, Madame!

597
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,120
I'll fall into the basin
of the waterfall.

598
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,560
Even so,
when Degawa goes to the front...

599
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,480
Madame goes into the waterfall.

600
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,960
Are any other old people
made to go through this?

601
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
What's this?

602
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,480
I've entered somewhere that hurts!

603
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,640
I can't breathe!

604
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
Okay, it's done!

605
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,720
Their sitting under the waterfall
ends without mishap.

606
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,280
Thank goodness
it was us who did this.

607
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,760
There's no way the girls can do it.

608
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,480
When they return to the hotel...

609
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,960
They're enjoying themselves.

610
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,760
You make sounds like
you're having fun on purpose.

611
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,160
How unpleasant.

612
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,880
Madame started to get annoyed.

613
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,040
"Hohohohoho"

614
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,680
Mayuko is the most stupid.

615
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,360
Stupid. Her act is so stupid!

616
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,080
She can't act.

617
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
"Hohohohoho"

618
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,800
How horrible.

619
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,720
Your effort is totally in vain.

620
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,640
Your effort is totally in vain.

621
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,520
Cliché, it's cliché.
Unusually cliché.

622
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Cliche, it's cliche.
Unusually cliche.

623
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,320
Their petty fight continues.

624
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,720
We also saw sea turtles.

625
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,840
- Wild?
- Yes.

626
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,360
- We saw many wild sea turtles.
- This big.

627
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,080
- Really?
- Really!

628
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,760
They must be tortoises.

629
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,680
They weren't.

630
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,800
Judging by the size,
they were tortoises.

631
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,400
You're horribly sore losers.

632
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,760
The shell is round, right?

633
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,720
It wasn't.

634
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,960
That's a tortoise.

635
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,080
We saw some green turtles.

636
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
Yes, we did.

637
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
They're tortoises.

638
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,800
It's a mystery why sea turtle means
victory and tortoise means defeat.

639
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,840
We have a special project.

640
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,600
To commemorate Yumeppe joining,

641
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,000
Degawa Girls will have
a cooking competition.

642
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,080
How confident are they?

643
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
I cook better than before.

644
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,680
- Really?
- Yes, really.

645
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,000
- Can I see the recipe?
- No.

646
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,320
Of course, you can't.

647
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,560
It's not my priority,
but my cooking has improved.

648
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,200
What is your current first priority?

649
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,920
It's Pilates lately.

650
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,000
Pilaf?

651
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,760
"Pilaf?"

652
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,280
I help my mother cook every night
at home.

653
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,840
- What?
- Wow, good on you!

654
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,600
What a wonderful story.

655
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,320
Like a primary school child's story.

656
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,480
What did you say?

657
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,080
It's quite impressive that she helps
Mummy cook when she's 20 years old.

658
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,480
Isn't it natural?

659
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
You find fault with that?

660
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,080
See? You...

661
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,480
Okay, arrested.

662
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
What about Kawakita, then?

663
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,880
I've gotten married,

664
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,440
so I cook a lot, of course.

665
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,480
What does your husband say?

666
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,680
He says he's never had anything
so delicious, every day.

667
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,800
That's amazing.

668
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,480
The story makes me feel sick.

669
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,040
It's nothing unusual.

670
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,880
Madame is the judge.

671
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
They'll come up with a menu
using food ingredients available,

672
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,640
and make delicious dishes
within an hour.

673
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,680
There are many things.

674
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,360
Ready, start!

675
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,840
What will each of them cook?

676
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
Madame is the judge.

677
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,760
They'll come up with a menu
using food ingredients available,

678
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,520
and make delicious dishes
within an hour.

679
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,440
There are many things.

680
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
Ready, start!

681
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,520
What will each of them cook?

682
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
The food ingredients are all here,

683
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,720
it's first come, first served.

684
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,280
Akane took the whole bowl of...

685
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,200
minced meat.

686
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,080
Oh, I wanted minced meat.

687
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,560
I'll give you some
if I have any left.

688
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,840
Thank you.

689
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,720
She plays dirty.

690
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,120
This is Degawa Girls.

691
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
That girl is amazing.

692
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,560
She's true to herself,
it's cool, in fact.

693
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,760
And then...

694
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,400
Can I have a paper and a pen?

695
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,720
Akane needs a recipe
and she started writing notes.

696
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,160
You'll make it yourself,
why use a pen?

697
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
If I can't organise my thoughts,
I'll panic.

698
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,600
I don't know what to do first
to make it more efficient.

699
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,560
We can't expect much
from Hotta and Tani.

700
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,480
What about the married, Kawakita?

701
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,280
She chose daikon radish,

702
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,960
it makes her look like
she's good at cooking.

703
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
What is Yumeppe making?

704
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,200
Tomato sauce?

705
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,720
- I'm making a tomato sauce.
- It looks nice.

706
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,320
The problem is her. This girl.

707
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
She's gone.

708
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,760
Did she go to look at her phone?
Let's check!

709
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
What?

710
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,760
- She isn't there!
- We can do that?

711
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
That's not fair.

712
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
Hey, Akane!

713
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,160
What?

714
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,680
What are you doing, Akane?

715
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,520
- That's not fair!
- You're washing it?

716
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,400
- What?
- I panicked.

717
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,520
We thought you were
looking at your phone.

718
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm not!

719
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm not that petty!

720
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,200
Okay, Yumeppe started
frying something.

721
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,480
I don't know what she's making yet,

722
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,120
but she'll add chicken
to her tomato sauce...

723
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,120
It already looks delicious.

724
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,280
I'll drop it.

725
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,960
Oh my goodness!

726
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,960
See? She cooks.

727
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,760
Look, the false tooth.
Not false tooth.

728
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,000
Her chopsticks.

729
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,920
Look, the false tooth.
Not false tooth.

730
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,040
Her chopsticks.

731
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,240
Look, handling the pan
with one hand.

732
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,040
Look!
That's how Yumeppe cooks.

733
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,280
And there's lots of meat.

734
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,520
Yumena, you're a good cook!

735
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,880
On the other hand, Hotta...

736
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,560
Your hands are shaking.

737
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,480
It's dangerous. I'm scared.

738
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,440
I hate men who makes fun of me
when I'm cooking.

739
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,600
No, I'm not teasing you.

740
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,840
Really...

741
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
She's worked up.

742
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,160
I've snapped because of that.

743
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,600
Akane Hotta, 28 years old, has gone
through many things in life.

744
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,560
It happens a lot lately.

745
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,960
On the other hand,
the 20-year-old Yumeppe...

746
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,560
This idea wouldn't occur
to Maria and Akane.

747
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,000
Why do you say that?

748
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,720
- She's doing this.
- It's obvious.

749
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,160
"Hahahaha"

750
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,400
- She's only 20 years old.
- Yes.

751
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,600
I'll make the second dish.

752
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,160
Ms Kawakita is making
her second dish.

753
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,600
We have one hour,

754
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,920
so we'll see how many
we can make in one hour.

755
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Wow, that's impressive.

756
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,080
Yumeppe is also making
the second dish, on top of that...

757
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,800
Yumeppe has started
deep-frying things!

758
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,120
- Wait, I'm making the same.
- Deep-fry?

759
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,920
She says she's making
the same dish.

760
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,040
I have absolutely no idea
what dish she's making.

761
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,760
- Akane.
- It's obvious!

762
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,960
She started to stir-fry
the minced meat in butter.

763
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, I want to go home.

764
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,040
- It means withdrawal, Akane.
- I want to board a flight soon!

765
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,760
General Dewi watches this girl
with a smile.

766
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,600
Maria started stir-frying something.

767
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,800
- Maria, it's burning.
- What?

768
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
The smoke is white, it's burning.

769
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm so sick of it.

770
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,080
"I want to go home."

771
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
- The second one.
- The second "want to go home."

772
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,600
Things are going as we expected.

773
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,360
Maria, we have good points too.

774
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,840
Wait, don't lump me in with you.

775
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,040
You abandoned her! How could you?

776
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,040
Yumeppe, this is Degawa Girls.

777
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,520
Okay, she started putting
the boiled potatoes into a bowl.

778
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,440
Wow, what?

779
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,600
Oh, it's hard.

780
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,720
Then, Hotta encounters an accident
later on.

781
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
The recipe that my life depends on!

782
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,560
The recipe flew to the sky!

783
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
She's lucky.

784
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Are you kidding me?

785
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
It's fantastic.

786
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,240
Excuse me, I've finished.
Will you try them first?

787
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,240
Kawakita has finished
making the dishes.

788
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,720
Stewed chicken and daikon radish,

789
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,080
stir-fried pork and cabbage.

790
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,200
She also made
miso soup with lots of mushrooms.

791
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,080
It's three Japanese dishes.

792
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,000
It looks delicious.

793
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,040
The daikon radish absorbed
the flavour.

794
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,360
Yes, it did.

795
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,560
As delicious as always.

796
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,080
Thank you.

797
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,760
The miso soup is delicious.

798
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,480
Next, what about
the 20-year-old Yumeppe?

799
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,200
She made two dishes
with pasta as the main dish.

800
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,880
Tomato sauce pasta
flavoured with garlic,

801
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
and a Western-styled plate with

802
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,280
enoki mushrooms wrapped in meat
and deep-fried aubergine.

803
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm confident in the pasta.

804
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,360
Delicious. Absolutely delicious.

805
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,760
- It has a strong flavour of garlic.
- Yes, the garlic.

806
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,920
To be honest, I had no idea
Yumeppe is such a good cook.

807
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,440
- Absolutely delicious.
- So good.

808
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,640
Thank you.

809
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,400
In fact, I think we can stop now.

810
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,120
Oh no, I'm full.

811
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,920
Stop eating. Hey, stop eating.

812
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,360
Stop eating. I've cooked.

813
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Stop eating.

814
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,680
Here it is. Her own luncheon mat!

815
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,480
I made the taste a bit richer
for the old people.

816
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,600
Old people?

817
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,880
- Shouldn't you make it less salty?
- It's the opposite?

818
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,280
I messed up!

819
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
The dishes Tani made are...

820
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
It's salad udon set meal.

821
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
- It's a set meal?
- It looks nice, though.

822
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,560
Oh, I got it wrong!

823
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,240
You prepared a luncheon mat,
and this is a set meal?

824
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,720
I said it wrong. It's a lunch set.

825
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,960
- Lunch set. That's right.
- Yes.

826
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,480
Do they taste okay?

827
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,560
It's quite tasty.

828
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Really?

829
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,360
What about the cream soup
she had adjusted to taste lighter?

830
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,000
She made the taste lighter?

831
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,800
"Hahaha"

832
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,800
- He can't say anything.
- Speechless.

833
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,040
Is this milk?

834
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,000
- Yes.
- She made it too bland?

835
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,720
The chicken has no flavour at all.

836
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,240
- It isn't enough?
- That's right. The taste...

837
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,480
- Not enough?
- No.

838
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,360
No, it's because I heard
old people like a lighter taste.

839
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,280
Come on.

840
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,440
How dare you! What's wrong with you?

841
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,840
The taste was rich at first,

842
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,840
- then I added water into it.
- I see.

843
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,880
I see.

844
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,520
Because old people
like light-tasting food...

845
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,920
The last one is...

846
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The recipe my life depends on!

847
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,520
The recipe of wind, Hotta.

848
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,400
The last one is...

849
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,440
The recipe my life depends on!

850
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
The recipe of wind, Hotta.

851
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Over here,

852
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,840
is our restaurant's
special croquette.

853
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,480
We only sell croquettes.

854
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,760
I didn't make any sauce to let you
taste the potato's good flavour.

855
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,480
What?

856
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,360
Manager, it isn't appetising.

857
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,880
The shape is bad,

858
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,560
the shredded cabbage is thick.

859
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,040
Wow, it's awfully soft.

860
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,400
- It's what we call fluffy.
- Fluffy?

861
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,920
"Hahahahaha"

862
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,240
Why?

863
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,000
It's good.

864
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,440
What?

865
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,840
Well, I like how fluffy it is.

866
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,960
Delicious.

867
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,000
What? Are you kidding me?

868
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,840
- Unlike how it looks.
- Thank you. I'm often told that.

869
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,120
It's ugly...

870
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,240
Well, it looks so ugly.

871
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,480
Just give me a compliment.

872
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,960
Who is the winner
of the cooking competition?

873
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
Each of you has made an effort,

874
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,840
- all the dishes were delicious.
- Yes, indeed.

875
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
But the exquisite dishes
were made by Yumeppe.

876
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,920
What?

877
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,760
Yumeppe wins.

878
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,080
Your mother must be
a very skilled cook.

879
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,960
Your mum will be delighted
when she watches our show.

880
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,240
Are you watching?

881
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,440
I'm in first place.

882
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,480
Madame, if you'll rank the second,
third, and fourth places...

883
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Obviously, the second is...

884
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,680
- Good...
- Ms Kawakita.

885
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,560
- Who's in third place?
- Maria.

886
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,920
What?

887
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,080
- What? Wait a minute!
- I'm in fourth place?

888
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,360
Personally,
I think Ms Kawakita is second,

889
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,120
third is Akane, and fourth is Maria.

890
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,080
Maria's udon was delicious,

891
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,400
- but the soup was too bland.
- Yes, the soup.

892
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,880
- I made it for old people.
- Shut up!

893
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,800
She says that a lot.

894
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,200
They will go explore a cave
on the last day of filming.

895
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,200
Their river trekking guide
will be Mr Nakagawa.

896
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,640
There are many caves in Iriomote.

897
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,280
The cave we're going to

898
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
is one you don't see in Japan.

899
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,240
It's a cave with an amazing scenery.

900
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,040
Do you know what Angel's Ladder is?

901
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
Angel's Ladder.

902
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,000
When sunlight shines into the cave
from a hole,

903
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,680
it looks like a ladder,
hence, the name.

904
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
It's a natural phenomenon.

905
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,320
They'll take a photo with it
for the calendar.

906
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,040
I can't bring myself to tell you,

907
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,440
but there's a very low chance
of it appearing,

908
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,880
about five percent.

909
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,360
Five percent?

910
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,720
Do the four of you have luck
like that?

911
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,920
I've been surviving
with only my luck.

912
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,520
I survived only by luck.

913
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,760
- It'll be okay?
- I'm going to show you.

914
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,320
I'm also very lucky.

915
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000
- Really?
- Really.

916
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,920
You don't look like you are.

917
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,880
I also bump into many celebrities
in our paparazzi project.

918
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,560
In that case, maybe we'll be okay.

919
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,400
Say, "What about me? Hey!"

920
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,880
I...

921
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,400
- "I..."
- "I..."

922
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
I gave you a very obvious pass!

923
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,520
I also asked Maria and ignored you,

924
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,840
so when I come here,
you should go, "Hey! What about me?"

925
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,120
That's what I should say?

926
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,200
Now, the team sets off.

927
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,360
I've been a guide for over 25 years,

928
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,960
the oldest guest I've taken there
so far was 74 years old.

929
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,960
If we can go there this time,
the record will be broken.

930
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,800
Wow, Madame.

931
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,120
Let's break his record.

932
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,480
The entrance of the cave
is on the other side of the jungle.

933
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,720
It's so dark!

934
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,880
It's a real jungle!

935
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,080
You talk too much, little girls.

936
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,600
What? We have no help?

937
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,600
Please do your best.

938
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,720
What?

939
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,680
Doesn't our guide accompany Madame
too much?

940
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,960
Think calmly. She's 81 years old.

941
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,960
I see.

942
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,560
Mr Nakagawa tells them something
they should pay attention to.

943
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,800
- You'll see the entrance soon.
- Okay.

944
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,520
The moment you see it,

945
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,800
you'll be speechless,
it's beyond your imagination.

946
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,200
- What?
- Then,

947
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,560
there's only one piece of advice
I can give you at the entrance.

948
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,520
Do your best.

949
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,200
- Do our best.
- Wait...

950
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,960
What the heck? I'm scared!

951
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,040
After they go past
the gap between the rocks...

952
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
It's here.

953
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,080
Wait...

954
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
This is the cave's entrance.

955
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,560
There's no way I can go in this!

956
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,240
I'll go through easily.

957
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,640
How thick is your waist?

958
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,640
80 centimetres.

959
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,760
Mine is much thicker than yours.

960
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,560
It's 105, 105, 105.

961
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,200
Who is going to go first?

962
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,920
- I'll go.
- Amazing!

963
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,120
- You don't have to see how it goes?
- It's fine, I have nothing to fear.

964
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,040
So cool.

965
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,680
So the oldest in history,

966
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,480
81-year-old Madame, will go first.

967
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,640
It's narrow.

968
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,640
She's going forward.

969
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,760
Oh, she went through it.

970
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,280
Madame did it with a smile.

971
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,560
It's okay. This is nothing.

972
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,160
Yumeppe

973
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960
and Tani also did it.

974
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,760
All right.

975
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,280
Then, Kawakita.

976
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,920
Isn't it narrow? What?

977
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,080
She's the noisiest.

978
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,280
She is.

979
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,240
- She's always the noisiest.
- She is.

980
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,160
Finally, it's Degawa's turn.

981
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,680
Will he be able to go through?

982
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,000
I can't do it, seriously.

983
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,520
I'll end my trip here
in the worst case scenario.

984
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,800
Degawa starts going in.

985
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,280
- Stretch your knees.
- Your arms.

986
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,480
No.

987
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,840
Don't talk altogether.

988
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,000
Ouch!

989
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,880
Push! Push!

990
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,280
Ready, go!

991
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,200
Ready, go!

992
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,520
No... My belly is stuck here.

993
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,800
Do your best!

994
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,360
What's wrong with this belly?

995
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,280
Why did my body become like this?

996
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,880
You can do it!

997
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,320
That said, after the effort he
made, he managed to go through.

998
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,240
I did it!

999
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920
- You can do it!
- I did it!

1000
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,800
- Amazing!
- I made it!

1001
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,200
Amazing!

1002
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,400
I'm so happy!
I feel like I was born.

1003
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,680
The last one is Hotta,
whom they completely forgot about.

1004
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,680
Nobody is there.

1005
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,040
Guys!

1006
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
Yes?

1007
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,960
Did you forget about my existence?

1008
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,840
We didn't forget you.

1009
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,440
Hurry up.

1010
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,560
When they go further...

1011
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,600
It's so cool!

1012
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
There is a huge space.

1013
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,760
There are hundreds of stalactite

1014
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,880
hanging in the mysterious cave.

1015
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,120
There are good stones in this cave,

1016
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,560
a phenomenon that's special
among stones occurs.

1017
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,400
It gives off light
even after I turn it off.

1018
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,440
Wow, amazing!

1019
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
The light stays.

1020
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,320
Amazing!

1021
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,800
This device is for research,
it gives off a special light.

1022
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,680
If I shine this light
to the back of the stones,

1023
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,160
the light will want to escape from
inside the stone after that.

1024
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,880
The crystal will be in the way.

1025
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,600
Diffused reflection occurs,
and it stays.

1026
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,960
Yes, the light takes a long time
to look for an exit.

1027
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,600
This is so interesting.

1028
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,600
Then, finally...

1029
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,800
It's our destination,
the room where the beam enters.

1030
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,280
Oh, everyone!

1031
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,960
This is our destination,
the room of the beam.

1032
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,480
Madame, too fast.

1033
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,640
Madame, it's too fast.

1034
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,040
Wait for us.

1035
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,440
The guide...

1036
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,480
I can see it.

1037
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
"Hole"

1038
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,480
But there is no light
shining from the hole.

1039
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,280
So we can only wait here.

1040
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,240
I'll look for a place
that's easy to stand on,

1041
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,640
and wait for the sun.

1042
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
The girls are exhausted.

1043
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,520
Hey!

1044
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,080
You're surprisingly unresponsive.

1045
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,760
But after waiting for two hours...

1046
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
They have waited long.

1047
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,600
It started for a bit.

1048
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
- Oh, it's true!
- Wow, it's here!

1049
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,960
It suddenly came!

1050
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,440
Have a look at this.
This is the Angel's Ladder.

1051
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,960
Light is reflected by
the water vapour in the cave,

1052
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,160
and forms a beautiful ladder.

1053
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,120
They moved there at once
and took a calendar photo.

1054
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,760
- Isn't it wonderful?
- It's lovely!

1055
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,960
It's stunning.

1056
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,240
People who aren't in the spotlight.

1057
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,480
Really!

1058
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,800
We're all in the shadow.

1059
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,840
The position Ms Kawakita takes
at a time like this is genius.

1060
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,000
In 24 Hour Television, she always
goes behind Mr Yuzo Kayama.

1061
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Every time when he sings,
"Goodbye, Earth!"

1062
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,680
It's Space Battleship Yamato.

1063
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,720
What?

1064
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,800
That's all for
Degawa Girls Gathering.

1065
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,960
You went to the place
where Madame wanted to go,

1066
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,440
so she didn't complain at all.

1067
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,360
Right.

1068
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,800
She was always positive,

1069
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,480
she went to the waterfall willingly.

1070
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,080
We walked on a tightrope
but they didn't include it.

1071
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,520
Walked on a tightrope?

1072
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,440
Exactly.

1073
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,000
We jumped from a very high place,

1074
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,960
what happened to that?

1075
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,160
What happened to that?

1076
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,640
Mr Takei films three extra ones.

1077
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,640
I understand if it's one,
but he filmed three extras.

1078
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,360
- Three.
- He filmed three extra ones.

1079
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,680
Just one part.

1080
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,880
Near the swimming pool,
fuelled by anger,

1081
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,280
she went, "This cliche act."

1082
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,040
How horrible.

1083
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,920
Your effort is totally in vain.

1084
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,880
Your effort is totally in vain.

1085
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,720
Cliche, it's cliche.
Unusually cliche.

1086
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,520
Cliche, it's cliche.
Unusually cliche.

1087
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,960
I'm impressed by Akane.

1088
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,560
Her recipe flew to the sky.
That was wonderful.

1089
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,160
- Brilliant.
- You were lucky there.

1090
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,760
I was desperate, really.

1091
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,400
You dare say that!

1092
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,720
The moment the recipe flew
to the sky,

1093
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,520
she had many chances to grab it,
but she did this many times,

1094
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,960
and missed it.

1095
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,040
Did you put it there
so that it'd be blown away easily?

1096
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,440
- I didn't.
- I see.

1097
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,320
Maybe she predicted
where the wind would blow.

1098
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,960
- She's a pro!
- No pro does that.
