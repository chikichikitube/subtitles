00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:17,952
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,889
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,142
-Hello.
-Hello there.

4
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,743
-Today's the day.
-Yes.

5
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,679
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO

6
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,281
Let go.

7
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:58,192
I thought Season Three turned out
really well.

8
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,595
But, surprisingly, some people say
they preferred Season Two.

9
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,733
It's interesting to see how viewers
gradually develop different tastes.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,768
WHICH IS YOUR FAVORITE DOCUMENTAL?

11
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,838
SEASON THREE'S NEW SYSTEM
"THE ZOMBIE SYSTEM"

12
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:17,111
I guess you could say
it was chaos in there.

13
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,314
A chaotic environment is one of the things
I wanted to create.

14
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,584
As the show progresses,
the muddle becomes less chaotic.

15
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,386
It becomes a lot easier to watch.

16
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,421
MAKING THE FINAL STAGES MORE DYNAMIC

17
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,522
Come in, Teddy Bear.

18
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,293
But if you do a good job as a zombie,
you can leave a good impression.

19
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,729
In the case of some players,

20
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,099
the quicker they become a zombie,
the better it turns out for them.

21
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,236
There's a possibility
their ulterior motive is to be a zombie.

22
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:45,105
But that would beg the question,
"Why did you even come?"

23
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,212
IT'S AN EVER-EVOLVING EXPERIMENT

24
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,482
HOW SHOULD WE ENJOY DOCUMENTAL?

25
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,752
Some viewers really get into the show,
and get excited about seeing who wins it.

26
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,888
I understand where they're coming from.

27
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,556
But aside from seeing who wins,

28
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:06,894
I wish our viewers were equally concerned
with seeing how funny the others are too.

29
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,830
THERE'S MORE FUN TO DOCUMENTAL
THAN JUST SEEING WHO WINS

30
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,267
Each episode provides an opportunity
to witness a miracle,

31
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,436
like when "Nyanko Star" first came out.

32
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,205
Don't forget.
They got the attention without winning.

33
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,978
Many people say this show has
too many dirty jokes.

34
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:25,813
Ow!

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,883
As far as I'm concerned,
there are no dirty jokes at all.

36
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,351
Not on this show.

37
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,019
They're not dirty jokes.

38
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,187
They're art.

39
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,689
ART?

40
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,830
We need to have
a deeper understanding of art.

41
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,341
While taking a walk this morning,

42
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,978
I saw a beautiful spider lily
outside a house down an alleyway.

43
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,248
Have you visited your family grave
this year?

44
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:15,189
I send you this invitation
with my best intentions.

45
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,825
I sincerely hope you will join me

46
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,994
with one million yen on your person.

47
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,330
I am hosting a Documental.

48
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,936
I have prepared 10 million yen
as the champion's prize.

49
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,909
Whether to participate or not,
the decision is yours.

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,747
If you are willing to participate,
I will contact you again

51
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,882
about the time and venue.

52
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,318
I look forward to your reply.

53
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,522
May this harvest season
bring you plenty of fruit.

54
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,791
Sincerely, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

55
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,797
THE COMEDIANS ARRIVE AT THE BATTLEFIELD

56
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,274
Someone is here.

57
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,351
Eh?

58
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,353
I'm the first one?

59
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,921
That's right.

60
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,757
-Why do I have to be first?
-This is Nobu.

61
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,098
Yeah, you wouldn't want to be
the first one to arrive.

62
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,568
Hi, I'm Nobu from Chidori.

63
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,537
What's this?

64
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:38,972
I got one!

65
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,075
I'm not the one you want.

66
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,611
I think Nobu is at the peak of his career.

67
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,747
IN HIS PRIME

68
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,916
He's quick to respond, and he's witty.

69
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,952
Nobu is able to create laughter
in his own right,

70
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,189
but I think his role here will be
to manipulate the others.

71
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,958
He'll use the actions of others
to create laughter.

72
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,627
THE TRICKY STRAIGHT MAN

73
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,932
I don't expect him to go on the offensive
very often.

74
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,267
THE COUNTERATTACK STRATEGY

75
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,637
If Nobu becomes a zombie,
he may not be funny at all.

76
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,840
"ZOMBIE NOBU" WON'T BE FUNNY?

77
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,907
After all,

78
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,410
I don't do the funny guy role.

79
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,245
It won't be funny.

80
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,980
HOW WILL THE STRAIGHT MAN FIGHT?

81
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:24,017
I wouldn't say I've neglected my comedy,
or just stayed in my comfort zone,

82
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,522
but lately I've done too many reports
about pancakes in Shibuya and Harajuku.

83
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,659
This coincides with my having doubts about
whether that's really what comedians do.

84
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,630
I think it's about time I started
acting like a comedian again. Yeah...

85
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,233
I have to play a game
where the stakes are big,

86
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,968
or I'll be finished.

87
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,374
How come I'm the first? Who are the rest?

88
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,277
-Who's coming?
-This situation...

89
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,946
Everything is a first for him.

90
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,151
Here comes another one.

91
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,389
He's brought quite a lot of stuff.

92
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,892
You'd take that much if you were
going to Spain.

93
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,830
It's Itoda!

94
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,701
I'm Jun Itoda from Speed Wagon.

95
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,404
Let me do it!

96
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,406
Excuse me.

97
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:20,874
Hello.

98
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,779
When I'm up against comedians,

99
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:29,183
I think my abilities to defend
and attack would be...

100
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,420
I think my stats would say I'm a bit
weaker than average in both categories.

101
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,989
THE WEAKER-THAN-AVERAGE COMEDIAN

102
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,425
He destroys the general vibe
without any qualm.

103
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,360
He's mentally strong, too.

104
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,529
Have you forgotten?

105
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,564
It's me!

106
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,933
I'm Master Hamburg!

107
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,001
IF YOU FEEL SORRY FOR ME, LAUGH

108
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,937
His mental strength can be scary.

109
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,539
Having a guy like this in the room
really is scary.

110
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,875
I'm sure he'll go on the offensive.

111
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,412
But his idea of an attack
won't be an attack at all.

112
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,114
HIS ATTACKS WON'T HAVE
THEIR DESIRED EFFECT

113
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,184
But what he doesn't mean as an attack
may, in fact, become one.

114
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,552
THE ACCIDENTAL ATTACKER

115
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,355
I'm not happy to see Jun here.
Not happy at all.

116
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,558
I could try mapping out
a bunch of different scenarios,

117
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,527
but it won't go as planned anyway.

118
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,531
So, whatever happens inside,
I hope I'll find something to work with.

119
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,132
LEAVING IT TO INSPIRATION

120
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,938
I have to bring something
they've never seen before.

121
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,040
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN ITODA

122
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,310
-I didn't even tell my partner.
-Neither did I.

123
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,412
They told me not to tell anyone.

124
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:39,887
Who is it?

125
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,127
-It's your second time.
-He never learns.

126
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,795
-It's my third time!
-Your third?

127
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,397
This is my third try.

128
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,633
I didn't expect you to come, Fujimoto.

129
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,369
-Lookee here, it's Nobu and Jun.
-Hey.

130
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,805
Hi! I'm Fujimoto from Fujiwara.

131
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,542
This time, I want to grab the title.

132
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,478
HE WANTS TO GRAB THE TITLE

133
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,947
Oh, no! Really?

134
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,651
I keep getting these invitations!

135
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,055
We could say he's like a semi-regular
on this show.

136
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,490
SEMI-REGULAR

137
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,426
He's good at setting various moods.

138
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,761
THE MOOD MAKER

139
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,897
Some fans claim I'm too soft on him.

140
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,966
"MATSUMOTO IS TOO SOFT ON FUJIMOTO"

141
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,668
It's not that I'm soft on him.

142
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:32,072
It's simply good to have someone in there
who's apt at setting the mood.

143
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,309
THE PERENNIAL SUPPORTING COMEDIAN

144
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,078
For the first time
in my 29-year-long career,

145
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,915
I've finally found the battlefield
that's perfect for me.

146
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,451
Well, it is in my opinion.

147
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,889
-You'll tear them.
-What are you doing?

148
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,958
What is that?

149
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,995
IN THE PREVIOUS SEASON,
HE ADVANCED TO THE FINAL FOUR

150
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,431
Last time, I started thinking I might win.

151
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,466
I really thought I might make it.

152
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:00,867
Yeah.

153
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,779
THE MOMENT OF CARELESSNESS
THAT HAUNTS HIM

154
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,483
I'm going to pounce on the little things,
one after the other.

155
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,385
I think that's how I should fight.

156
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,754
AIMING TO WIN BY POUNCING
ON THE LITTLE THINGS

157
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,190
-We all play the straight man.
-You're right.

158
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,424
All three of us so far.

159
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,726
I'll sit over there.

160
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,529
-Your bag is so small.
-I always only bring this much.

161
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,865
-It's so small.
-I didn't have much to bring.

162
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,935
-I'm not the type who uses props.
-You're right.

163
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,511
Here's another one.

164
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,280
Again?

165
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,349
Why are you here?

166
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,684
You come here so often!

167
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,085
Don't be like that.

168
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,720
Fujimoto's here all the time too!

169
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,355
So are you.

170
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,290
"SORRY ABOUT THE FUSS"

171
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,460
Hi, I'm Kukky from Yaseibakudan.

172
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:04,831
You're here!

173
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,534
Again?

174
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,603
She's just my manager.

175
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,272
Kukky is prone to laugh easily.

176
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,375
But his attack level is high enough
to overcome that weakness.

177
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,178
THE COMEDIAN KILLER

178
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,647
The most formidable player was Kukky.

179
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,715
Take a look.

180
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,483
That's a shrunken head.

181
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,587
He is totally off the wall.

182
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,990
You never know what he'll do next.

183
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:35,128
It's when Kukky turns into a zombie
that he becomes truly terrifying.

184
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,731
-Look how small it is.
-Your sweater's that small?

185
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,069
Yoshimoto opened their doors
to a most formidable creature.

186
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,503
A MOST FORMIDABLE CREATURE

187
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,039
It's a cliché,
but third time's the charm, right?

188
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,808
THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM

189
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,976
I'll seriously try to win this time.

190
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,145
SERIOUSLY AIMING TO WIN

191
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,114
Honestly, it's like,

192
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,484
I'll rupture eardrums if I have to.
Whatever it takes to win.

193
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,555
I'll thread fishing line through their
cheeks and keep pulling until they smile.

194
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,159
I'll go all-out to win, just for a change.

195
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,794
THE MONSTER WANTS TO WIN

196
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,030
-You have to do it.
-No, I don't.

197
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,466
You're wearing the same watch as me.
Cut it out!

198
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,601
-Get over it.
-Let's use this later.

199
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,170
-Look at that.
-They're exactly the same.

200
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,940
We're lucky you didn't notice
after play had started.

201
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,242
-What good luck.
-That's scary.

202
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,411
-What's with that?
-How could this happen?

203
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,079
No more freaky things like that.

204
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,688
And damn Kukky...

205
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,057
You'll definitely do that thing, right?

206
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,625
-Probably.
-Definitely.

207
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,726
What about...

208
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,531
No way. She's a tough one.

209
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,899
We have a girl?

210
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,467
Wow.

211
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,669
-Women compete too?
-We have a girl.

212
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,339
-What did you bring?
-She means business!

213
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,708
-Sorry for bringing so much.
-What is that?

214
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:59,546
I'm Kazuko Kurosawa from Morisanchu.
I'm 39 years old, and I'm single.

215
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,485
Oh, now I'm fumbling. I'm losing it.

216
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,125
As the only female contestant,
she'll be a rose among weeds.

217
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,128
Adding a woman into the mix
can make things interesting.

218
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,998
Her partner Oshima was here before.

219
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,299
Just pour vinegar on it.

220
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,869
How dare you pour vinegar on my panties?

221
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,971
As a trio, Morisanchu has great potential.

222
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,875
When Kurosawa snaps and lets loose,
I don't think anybody can stop her.

223
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,777
That might happen here today.

224
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,481
SHE SINGS, SHE DANCES
AND SHE'S CHUBBY

225
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,021
If there is to be a female winner,
it could very well be her.

226
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,856
THE COMEDIENNE CLOSEST TO THE TITLE

227
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,991
But she has one weakness.

228
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,360
KUROSAWA'S WEAKNESS?

229
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,996
She's on her period today.

230
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,133
Let's see if that works out
for the better.

231
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,634
Right.

232
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,603
What should I do?

233
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,038
She scares me.

234
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,806
Why sit next to me?

235
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,643
I've never won any of the major contests,
like M-1 or King of Conte.

236
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,612
But if I can win Documental...

237
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,682
THE UNCROWNED QUEEN
SHALL FIND HER KINGDOM

238
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,152
I want to make sure other comediennes
get a chance here.

239
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,156
I'll have to do my best
among all these men.

240
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,827
-Are you going to be okay in here?
-Actually, I'm nearly 40 now.

241
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,296
So I've stopped making
adult-themed references.

242
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,764
-Oh, really.
-Yes.

243
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,601
-I'm not in my 20s anymore.
-"Adult-themed references"?

244
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,470
-Nobody wants you to talk about sex.
-No sexy stuff?

245
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,412
Someone's here.

246
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,249
No way!

247
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,084
-Why?
-Both of you?

248
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,821
-Hang on...
-We know. But this is one of our points.

249
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,123
Why are you here?

250
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,925
They're the first duo, right?

251
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,593
No way. Nobu's here!

252
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,395
Oh, my.

253
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:59,332
This is a new thing we'll be trying
this season.

254
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,602
You might call it a device of ours.

255
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,605
We're throwing in both members
of a comedic duo.

256
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,775
I'm Daigo from Chidori.

257
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,711
I will not laugh.

258
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,387
Did Mr. Matsumoto pick me himself?

259
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,189
We'll throw in both Nobu and Daigo. A duo.

260
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,459
This is actually a first for this program.

261
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,528
A FIRST-TIME EXPERIMENT IN SEASON 4

262
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,197
I wonder how this will turn out.

263
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:35,368
It's one new idea we'll be
putting on trial.

264
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,971
Chidori are interesting for the fact that

265
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,007
I think both of them
are suitable for this show.

266
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,075
Probably.

267
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,144
They're funny.

268
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,548
Of course,
I have high expectations for them.

269
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,418
But there's one thing.

270
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,420
I think they laugh too easily.

271
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,755
THE BASHFUL RUFFIAN

272
00:15:55,822 --> 00:16:00,694
Doing things in a matter-of-fact manner,
without laughing,

273
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,529
that's one thing I'm not good at.

274
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,732
I'm the type of guy who laughs
as he makes the others laugh.

275
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,934
It may end up being a day I regret.

276
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,338
I won't have any idea how I should behave
until it starts.

277
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,674
For example, if Nobu was there,
I could just say something funny.

278
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,776
He would jump in with the right quip.

279
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,311
We have the trusted pattern.

280
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,881
But since I won't have that,
I'll have to figure out what to do.

281
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,952
-This is an amazing twist.
-What should we do?

282
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,356
Why is Chidori here as a duo?
Yoshimoto sure wants to promote you.

283
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,690
Don't say it like that.

284
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,496
Everyone's from Yoshimoto.
Here's another one.

285
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,532
I'm done for!

286
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:40,500
This one's tough!

287
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,901
I'll definitely laugh!

288
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,337
-Damn.
-You're wearing different glasses today.

289
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,741
I forgot my real ones.
I was going to use these for a joke today.

290
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,476
I'm already laughing.

291
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,845
I was so nervous, I left them at home.

292
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,282
I'm Kazuki Iio from Zun.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

293
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,853
I'm so nervous,
I developed an irregular heartbeat.

294
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,021
Excuse me.

295
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,225
Wow!

296
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,827
I got one of these. Wow!

297
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,029
WHAT KIND OF GAG WILL WORK ON DOCUMENTAL?

298
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,264
I'm doing one already.

299
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,700
Mr. Cameraman, can you pan in on my feet?

300
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,704
I call this gag "Seven or eight minutes
of keeping my feet like a model."

301
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,774
I have dozens of gags.

302
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,144
But if you ask how many will help
when my back's against the wall,

303
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,979
I could count them on one hand.

304
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,883
Iio makes jokes that come from
a totally different angle than ours.

305
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,785
THE UNEXPECTED AMBUSH

306
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:36,055
He sets his comedic sights on niches
that we don't even bother looking at.

307
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,358
THE LEGITIMATE SUCCESSOR
OF THE SEKINE STYLE

308
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,926
He will survey the situation,

309
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,762
and instead of fighting all-out
in all the rounds,

310
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,465
he'll go on a spurt
in rounds five and eight.

311
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,300
I think that's how he'll play it.

312
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,770
If I was the sprinter type,
I would've been popular in my 20s.

313
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,140
I'm more like Chinese medicine.
I exert my effects gradually.

314
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,809
What do you guys think?

315
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,478
Summers described me perfectly
about 15 years ago.

316
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,580
They said, "You're a staff meal."

317
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,116
"You're a sushi chef's curry."

318
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,851
I'm never on the menu.

319
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,287
If I get beaten to a pulp in there,

320
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,588
I'll walk home.

321
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,691
Then I'll pat myself on the back
and go to bed.

322
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,226
At least I did some exercise.

323
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,264
It would be funny
if your partner comes next.

324
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,200
He told me he had the day off.

325
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,440
-What if it's him?
-I don't like this.

326
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,943
Fujimoto is the most experienced...

327
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,581
Not him!

328
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,749
-He'll definitely make me laugh!
-For real?

329
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,519
His face definitely gives him
an unfair advantage.

330
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,989
He looks like he's been
preserved in formaldehyde.

331
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,060
I'm Yusuke Nishizawa from Daian.

332
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:48,561
I'll do my best.

333
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,031
Hello.

334
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,600
Again?

335
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,802
Huh? It's not for me?

336
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,270
Shut up for a second.

337
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,805
It's not for Mr. Tsuda.

338
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,340
Sure it's not mine?

339
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,442
I quite like Daian's comedy routines.

340
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,843
I watched them a lot.

341
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,747
They're funny.
I was always impressed with them.

342
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,450
This is your chance.
It will get you on first base.

343
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,684
Your partner approves.

344
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,986
-A big chance!
-Yeah.

345
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,489
But I don't remember
ever seeing him laugh.

346
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,458
In that respect, he may do well.

347
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,494
People often say that I have a poker face.

348
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,130
But the truth is, I laugh quite easily.

349
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,866
I'll have to be careful about that.

350
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,903
When you're in that room,
everyone's on equal footing.

351
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,704
A junior can beat a senior.

352
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,606
SHOOTING FOR REAL

353
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,675
That idea excites me too.

354
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:41,414
I think you'll see how hungry I am
to topple the big guys.

355
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,151
He makes people laugh
just by looking their way.

356
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,921
-This is scary.
-Is he a bit of an airhead?

357
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,389
He's not an airhead.

358
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,092
I'm not an airhead, but one thing is,
despite this poker face of mine,

359
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,161
-I laugh really easily.
-Exactly.

360
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,896
-Really?
-That's why I'm scared.

361
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,198
I've never seen him laughing hard.

362
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,200
-Nishizawa laughs a lot.
-He sure does.

363
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,971
Our ninth player? Yeah.

364
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,242
-How many to come?
-Two more.

365
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,276
One's here.

366
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,046
-Hello.
-Whoa!

367
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,213
No way.

368
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,449
I'm done for. He's my type of comedian.

369
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,820
He's a monster.

370
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,121
I know you guys.

371
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,923
-Of course you do.
-So what?

372
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,558
-What would you expect?
-Damn.

373
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,261
I have no idea how this will turn out.

374
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,264
I'm Kurochan from Yasuda Dai Circus.

375
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,500
I really want the 10 million yen.

376
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,138
What's this?

377
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,876
A letter?

378
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,244
Is this...

379
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,880
He's an unknown quantity.

380
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,616
I have no idea.

381
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:54,287
Usually, everyone would play with him,
but I'm not sure here.

382
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,156
If Fujimoto starts toying with him,
there'll be trouble.

383
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,224
FUJIMOTO X KUROCHAN

384
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,826
-Cut it out.
-But I'm...

385
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,661
Just act normally. Look where we are.

386
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,097
THE MOST-PRANKED COMEDIAN IN JAPAN

387
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,432
Depending on how the others toy with him,

388
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:10,470
he may enter a completely unexpected
"bonus stage."

389
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,372
It's like everyone says.

390
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,507
I'm just one of television's puppets.

391
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,143
I never initiate anything.

392
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,380
I don't know much about comedy,
but that means

393
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,815
I'm not scared of high-level
comedy techniques.

394
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,350
I won't get them anyway.

395
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,254
I think I have strong defensive skills.
I really do.

396
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,556
This might be the perfect opportunity.

397
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:34,661
If I can show people that I'm able
to make people laugh here,

398
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:39,232
I might finally get other jobs,
besides all of those candid camera ones.

399
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,134
I'm going to change.

400
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,769
This really will change things.

401
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,204
I'll move onto the next level.

402
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,439
I'll do it!

403
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,207
My parents will pay for it!

404
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,677
HIS PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR IT

405
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,746
One more to go.

406
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,781
Who's coming?

407
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,315
The last may be the nastiest.

408
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,751
As for the last person, well...

409
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,354
I'm sure they won't be expecting
this last player.

410
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,525
No, Watabe would never laugh.

411
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,666
-What if we guessed right?
-Here's our last player.

412
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,669
It can't be!

413
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,571
What a surprise!

414
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,739
It can't be!

415
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,974
-Are you competing?
-You accepted?

416
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,676
What kind of opponents are you?

417
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,745
Straight back at you.

418
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,451
-You don't need any more money.
-Ten million is pocket money to you.

419
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,455
Hello.
I'm Miyasako from Ameagari-Kesshitai.

420
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,090
Excuse me.

421
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,792
Whoa.

422
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,794
For real?

423
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,429
I've been...

424
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,198
I've been through a lot lately.

425
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm not emotionally stable enough
for this.

426
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,738
The only time I'm allowed to smile is
when I'm working, actually.

427
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,005
As things stand.

428
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,941
Before that thing happened...

429
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:58,177
Stop saying "that thing."
What does "that thing" even mean?

430
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,748
If I compete in this state of mind,
I may have a chance of winning.

431
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,783
HE'S IN NO MOOD TO LAUGH

432
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:07,153
I really didn't think Miyasako
would accept this offer.

433
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,422
Maybe "that thing" changed him.

434
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,693
THE NOT-SO-FAITHFUL
DO-OR-DIE COMEDIAN

435
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,996
He really is more insane
than people think.

436
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,899
When he snaps, it's really a sight to see.

437
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,169
The way he can explode is
quite formidable.

438
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:29,342
I'm the type of guy who can step over
the line, regardless of who's involved.

439
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:34,046
If I find any of the guys in there a bit
bothersome, I will step on their necks.

440
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,282
HE STEPS ON THE NECKS
OF THOSE HE DISLIKES

441
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:40,653
Recently, I've had a lot of jobs
as a show host.

442
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,257
I don't get many chances to fool around.

443
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,992
WANTS TO FOOL AROUND FOR A CHANGE

444
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,493
I'd like to go all the way.

445
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,563
Miyasako is here?

446
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,864
This is real bad.

447
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,766
We'll have to look after him.

448
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,088
It won't be fair if the duo
does something as a team.

449
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,924
We've been discussing that already.

450
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,992
There's nothing in the rules against it.

451
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,261
-Really.
-Anything goes in here.

452
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,536
-That's quick.
-He's trotting.

453
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,471
-Why?
-He looks nice and chirpy.

454
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,540
Nice and chirpy, but a bit like Takeshi.

455
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,310
-Like Takeshi.
-Bursting in like that.

456
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,445
Know what? You guys are funny already.

457
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,447
-I've been watching backstage.
-Really?

458
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,883
This may not even last for six hours.

459
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,551
-You're right.
-It's possible.

460
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,688
-This is seriously bad.
-I had a feeling that might happen.

461
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,490
-Many of us laugh easily.
-Yeah.

462
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,093
Has it ever not lasted six hours?

463
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,361
-Never.
-Thought so.

464
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,129
But on the other hand,

465
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,433
-we always see people laugh at Kurochan.
-That's right.

466
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,501
-But I've never seen him laugh.
-Yeah.

467
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,338
-I'm yet to see Kurochan smile.
-Exactly my point.

468
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,440
I've only ever seen his troubled look.

469
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:10,610
That's because prr...
Because I'm always being pranked.

470
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,812
He said, "Prr..."

471
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,480
No, I just made a weird noise.

472
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:15,581
I beg your pardon.

473
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,383
You'll have to cut that out.

474
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,851
And what's even worse,

475
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,722
Fujimoto always chips in with
the perfect quip at moments like that.

476
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,590
Your comment is what makes us laugh.

477
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,025
I really don't like this.

478
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,693
It's just a knee-jerk reaction.

479
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,197
-Try delaying your timing.
-It will be funny for a different reason.

480
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,165
Your quips are too good. You too, Nobu.

481
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,801
-He comes to life. We breathe it into him.
-Exactly.

482
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,703
You pour a heart and soul into him.

483
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,673
-He's right.
-We don't pour anything in!

484
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,241
-And Miyasako...
-Yes.

485
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,210
-It's brave of him to come.
-Yeah.

486
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,611
This is such a surprise.

487
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,347
-Well, he's here thanks to "that thing."
-Yeah.

488
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,883
My wife told me to keep that off limits.

489
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,685
That's impossible.

490
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,654
It's up to you. I won't touch on it.

491
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:55,821
No, no, no.

492
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,390
And you two, Chidori.

493
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,659
I saw your show yesterday at Lumine.

494
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,993
For real?

495
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,562
-Seriously?
-I saw your manzai act.

496
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:04,797
That's scary!

497
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,299
Were you up in the booth?

498
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,467
No, I watched from a seat in the last row.

499
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,502
Really?

500
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,604
-Why?
-I wanted to check Lumine out.

501
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,806
-That's scary.
-Don't do that.

502
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,841
The crowd went wild when they came out.

503
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,443
Well, we get a few cheers.

504
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,946
With a crowd that wild,
I expected more laughter.

505
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,716
If you call that bombing, I can't imagine
what you've done to crowds.

506
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,651
No, your crowd laughed.

507
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,087
You didn't bomb.
They were laughing, but...

508
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,724
-I was highlighting how much they cheered.
-You made them go too wild.

509
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,894
-Iio is here as well.
-Yes, he means trouble too.

510
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,863
-Did you come from a jar of formaldehyde?
-No, I didn't.

511
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,299
-Were you soaked in formaldehyde?
-No, I wasn't.

512
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,801
I wasn't put in anything.

513
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,236
-You're fresh from the seabed?
-No, I'm not.

514
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:45,871
I was in Osaka all this time.

515
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,573
Did you gnaw on rock salt?

516
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,442
Does rock salt do this to your face?

517
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,610
-The sodium made him puffy.
-Too much salt.

518
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,312
You're way too puffy.

519
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,614
You're a merman.
A merman's carcass, right?

520
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,049
I'm not a merman's carcass.

521
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,017
-Really?
-Yeah.

522
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,319
-Half-way through an experiment?
-No.

523
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,854
-Metamorphosing?
-No, I'm not.

524
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,556
Been immersed in amniotic fluid?

525
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,359
-I wasn't immersed in amniotic fluid.
-I see.

526
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,261
Hey, that's enough.
I'll be stuck with those in my mind.

527
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,230
Sorry. I really am. I'll stop.

528
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,766
-I think he'll be a strong contender.
-Definitely.

529
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,835
-He's been through a lot.
-Exactly.

530
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,236
He's mentally strong.

531
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:18,904
Absolutely.

532
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,107
I bet he is. He's overcome a lot.

533
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,843
-I've never seen him laugh really hard.
-That's right.

534
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,644
-He only makes people laugh.
-Yeah.

535
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:28,414
No, I do laugh. Really. So, for today,

536
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:29,715
let me do it!

537
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,951
He has many characters up his sleeve.

538
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,686
And he's another monster, too.

539
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,022
He sure is. He just keeps on coming.

540
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,990
But I have zero defensive power.

541
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,658
No defensive power.

542
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,927
You have that character... Pooh?

543
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,863
-Winnie the Pooh, right?
-Yeah.

544
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,898
-Teddy Bear.
-It's "Teddy Bear"?

545
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:46,899
Teddy Bear.

546
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,602
When I was at my lowest,
it made me laugh my ass off.

547
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,771
-You saved him.
-He saved you.

548
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,372
The power of laughter.

549
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,976
It saved me. It really did,
but if he does anything like that today...

550
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,411
It would mean danger here.

551
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,046
-He is insane.
-That's true.

552
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,681
-He really is nuts.
-He's created a few series here.

553
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,250
He lays cards on the table...

554
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,285
-No, I wouldn't do that.
-Please don't.

555
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,421
And Kurosawa is on her period today.

556
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,222
So don't be too harsh on her.

557
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,393
You might hear a ripping sound later on.
It's 40-centimeters long.

558
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,496
-It's a 40-centimeter nighttime pad.
-It's your heaviest day?

559
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:19,298
-Forty centimeters!
-Enough!

560
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,499
That sounds tough.

561
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,035
-Really, 40 centimeters?
-Leave her alone.

562
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,970
-It's the biggest one.
-This long?

563
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,839
It must cover your navel.

564
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,876
All the way from the back.

565
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,645
-Like seaweed.
-That's enough.

566
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,181
-Seaweed in your pants.
-It won't absorb a thing.

567
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:39,318
WHOEVER DOESN'T LAUGH GETS 10 MILLION,
PLUS MATSUMOTO'S MILLION YEN

568
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,655
I'll skip over most of the rules.
Fujimoto knows them well, right?

569
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,090
Yes, it's my third try.

570
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,559
THOSE WHO LAUGH GET
A YELLOW, ORANGE OR RED CARD

571
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,427
We'll implement the Zombie Rule again.

572
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,563
A RED CARD MEANS ELIMINATION
FROM THE GAME

573
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,566
-You can come back as zombies.
-And make the others laugh.

574
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,102
IF THE ZOMBIES MAKE EVERYONE LAUGH
IT'S A NO-CONTEST

575
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,305
-Let's say we're down to two players left.
-Okay.

576
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,008
With only two players in the room,
the zombies come in.

577
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,145
Let's say that the zombies make
this person laugh.

578
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,481
This person doesn't win yet.

579
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,484
THE LAST PLAYER MUSTN'T LAUGH
UNTIL SIX HOURS PASS

580
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,653
If you're the last player left,
but there's another hour to go,

581
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,822
you must endure the zombies for that hour.

582
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,190
Now I get it.

583
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,258
That's impossible.

584
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:20,659
Only then do you win.

585
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,562
-We have to last the entire six hours.
-That's right.

586
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,431
There's no way I'd survive that.

587
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,999
If the zombies get everyone...

588
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,401
-It's no longer a contest.
-Seriously?

589
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,371
It will be as if this never happened
in the first place.

590
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,975
But it will mean this series was
that funny.

591
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,877
And it should be remembered as such.

592
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,779
It's also possible
that both members of Chidori remain.

593
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:41,714
That's right.

594
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,584
As far as the rules are concerned,
could the two of us do something...

595
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:46,852
Does anything go?

596
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,754
-In front of everyone?
-Like this.

597
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,189
-As a pair?
-As a pair.

598
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,558
-I don't have a problem with that.
-I see.

599
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,426
-So, anything goes.
-Are you sure?

600
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,896
So, everyone,
it's time to collect the money.

601
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,764
Ugh, this'll hurt!

602
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,336
I don't know if we need the yellow...

603
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,106
I mean, maybe we don't need
the orange card this time.

604
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,207
Really?

605
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,643
-We'll have the zombies too.
-Right.

606
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,546
If you get two of these,
you'll be getting a red next.

607
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,215
Actually, I mean that yellow
will be followed by red.

608
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,151
This brings my total to three million yen.

609
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,322
-Three million?
-It goes out as fast as it comes in.

610
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,924
Three million yen?

611
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,492
What the hell are you doing?

612
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,862
-Try rejecting the offer.
-You lose each time.

613
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,997
I don't have any good reason to refuse.

614
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,200
-Kukky too.
-I've paid three million too.

615
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,969
-Six million between us.
-Your wives will beat you up.

616
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,172
-You only earn 16,000 per show at Lumine.
-Don't tell them.

617
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:41,273
You earn that much?

618
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:42,575
Do you get less?

619
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,611
But people,
this all really makes me so happy.

620
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,012
Think about it.

621
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,448
The fact you can all bring
one million yen.

622
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,783
That really touches me.

623
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,918
I've watched the series and...

624
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:53,819
Sorry.

625
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,955
-What's with you?
-I lost my timing.

626
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,189
Is that money legit?

627
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,357
It is... Eh?

628
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,692
Is that money legit?

629
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,493
It's not dirty money. I washed it.

630
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,430
-Don't bring the bills all loose.
-He didn't wrap them.

631
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,998
Wrap them in a bundle, idiot.

632
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,867
I had to make five withdrawals
at the convenience store ATM.

633
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,703
You can only withdraw 200 at a time.

634
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,939
-All you needed was some rubber.
-You have rubbers, don't you?

635
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,908
-"Rubber"?
-A rubber band!

636
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,143
-Oh, that rubber?
-Don't slip in dirty jokes.

637
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,246
-He's gonna get me.
-Don't start already.

638
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,447
Don't start yet.

639
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,116
-And here is my...
-There it is!

640
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,085
Thank you!

641
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,921
I have to pay one million yen
for no good reason.

642
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,389
-Every time.
-Seriously.

643
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,658
Seriously, this gets deducted each time!

644
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,994
This money! From my pay slip!

645
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,595
That's what you call shocking!

646
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,964
-We can imagine.
-Mr. Matsumoto...

647
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:40,165
Seriously!

648
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,834
He says this every time, right?

649
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:45,404
I know how much he has in the bank.
It's like, "What's the big deal?"

650
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,006
It doesn't matter how much I have.

651
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,509
I lose one million yen for hosting a show.
Doesn't that sound wrong?

652
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,279
But there are those
who can afford to lose it,

653
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,215
-And those who...
-No, that's not how it works.

654
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,817
For Kukky, losing three million
must have been hell.

655
00:31:58,884 --> 00:31:59,852
It really is hell.

656
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,288
Losing one million hurts the same for all.

657
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,555
It's the same pain.

658
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,357
-It's the same.
-More or less.

659
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,393
-It all adds up to this.
-Whoa!

660
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,395
-Wow.
-This is it.

661
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,396
Awesome!

662
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,498
-May I touch it?
-This really is awesome.

663
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,534
-Wow.
-It's amazing.

664
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:19,805
Both piles are worth the same,
but crisp new bills sure have their charm.

665
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,742
You're strict about facial expressions.
Like when our faces loosen.

666
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,245
How much of a smirk
are we allowed to make?

667
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:29,581
I would really like for you guys to have
firmer faces.

668
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:30,849
That's all.

669
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:33,986
Last season, Yamamoto had
a bit of a grin the whole time.

670
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,721
-He was nearly giggling.
-He was.

671
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,390
-Ohchi was terrible, too.
-Yeah. So be careful there.

672
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,525
I mean,

673
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,694
you don't need a look of determination...

674
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:44,596
-But that's out, right there.
-Nobu has a smiley face.

675
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,365
-Yeah, I do.
-He's right.

676
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,000
You'll have to frown.

677
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,335
-Like that.
-Yeah.

678
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,837
Right. That's the face.

679
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,441
That's wrong for another reason.

680
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,810
That's better. That is a good face.

681
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,512
That's wrong! Stop it!

682
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,247
Can you keep that for six hours?

683
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,415
"Mr. Serious."

684
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,385
-I'll laugh at myself.
-The rookie comedian look.

685
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,123
Of course,
it's important to try and win this.

686
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:15,661
But if you follow Kukky's example
and make things funny as a zombie...

687
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:18,497
That's what comedy fans will
really appreciate.

688
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,766
-Keep that in mind.
-Be funny till the end.

689
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,201
It's not all about winning.

690
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,535
-Are we starting?
-Yeah.

691
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:24,636
No way!

692
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,606
-Not so fast. Give me a moment.
-That was rather abrupt.

693
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,808
And one more thing...

694
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,412
As a new thing this season,

695
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,713
you can order food.

696
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,183
You can call...
This one's an internal line.

697
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,052
Use the external line to call them.

698
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,454
You can have food delivered here.

699
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,158
If anything else pops up,
I'll let you know as we go.

700
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,193
Is that all I needed to say?

701
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,129
Well, you have this stuff here too.

702
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,599
If you think you can play with anything,
feel free to do so.

703
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,701
-He's going.
-Bye.

704
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,570
-Does it start when you leave?
-After I leave,

705
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,873
the lights will change,
and then it starts.

706
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,941
-Okay.
-I'm scared.

707
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,977
-Have a good one.
-Okay.

708
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,745
Thank you.

709
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:08,614
I'll have a smoke.

710
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,949
-We can smoke, right?
-You can.

711
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,420
I'll put my bags away in there.

712
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,256
-Laughing while you still can?
-If we don't laugh now...

713
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,898
"I'm Kurochan."
I have to get used to Kurochan.

714
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,302
Don't look at me like that.

715
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,737
What the hell is this?

716
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,405
Where do my things go? Okay.

717
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,307
Shall we get started?

718
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,344
Start!

719
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,849
Has it started?

720
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,350
Yes, we've started.

721
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:47,820
-The air horn went "farrrp."
-We're on.

722
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,954
Got it.

723
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,823
-We're on!
-Okay.

724
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,259
-I'm going to the toilet.
-I don't like this atmosphere.

725
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,762
-It's incredible.
-The start caught us off guard.

726
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,263
When I was peeing just now,

727
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,599
just as the last drop was coming out,

728
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,667
it went "farrrp."

729
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,369
That was a good one.

730
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,905
That was a nice "farrrp." Timing and all.

731
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,343
Daigo's been smirking a bit already.

732
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:13,579
Huh?

733
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,714
When we said this had started, you smiled.

734
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,850
Are you an idiot? You're smiling already.

735
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,252
-This face?
-That's what we mean. That's out.

736
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,286
If this is a smile...

737
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,857
Let him know he's wrong, guys.
I agree with you.

738
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,859
-You're smiling.
-Wait. Which face?

739
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,794
-Go back.
-You smiled halfway through.

740
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,529
You're saying this is out?

741
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,197
That's out. You can't do that.

742
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,465
All smiles are out.

743
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,133
Even when you asked just now...

744
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,970
Making a face to ask whether
it's out or not is out.

745
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,805
-That's out too?
-Right. Be careful.

746
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:43,008
We'll let that one go as an explanation...
What's that sound?

747
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:46,078
-That could've gotten you a red card.
-Why can I hear water?

748
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,880
-Is that how it goes?
-Yeah.

749
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,349
-That's out.
-I need to pee.

750
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,884
It's the sound of the toilet.

751
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,653
What did you think of Nobu's pee?

752
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,822
Is this dry ice?

753
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,391
-Someone's making a noise.
-There's no trash can.

754
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,627
-What's this?
-Can I drink some water?

755
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,563
Nobu said something about his pee,
but I missed it.

756
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:06,965
Shut up! He needs to shut up.

757
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,768
-There was a mic in the bathroom.
-A mic?

758
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,137
More importantly,
can we talk about Nobu's pee?

759
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:14,273
Shut up! He keeps nagging me about that.

760
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,476
Come on. Nobody wants to see
childhood friends fighting.

761
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,912
-The last drop...
-Why talk about pee?

762
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,080
The last drop?

763
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,684
-I found the trash can.
-Stop talking about pee.

764
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:29,588
He said that, just as the last drop
fell into the bowl,

765
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,190
the siren went "farrrp."

766
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,458
Is that what Nobu said?

767
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,460
Yes, that's all I said.

768
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,630
Iio, how about doing
an opening gag for us?

769
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,999
-Shall I?
-Just one, to brighten things up.

770
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,301
To get things going.

771
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,969
-To mark the start.
-Good idea.

772
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,370
There's no water here.

773
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,472
-Could you do one for us?
-The water's here.

774
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:48,907
There's some here.

775
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,677
-Guys, you can't just not watch.
-What's happening?

776
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,246
We're going to have a little opening gag.

777
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,347
An opening gag?

778
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,949
-By Iio?
-Apparently.

779
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:57,983
Ready?

780
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,152
-But we have six hours, right?
-Yeah.

781
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,720
It's way too early.

782
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,289
It will only be one gag.

783
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,725
-Where's Miyasako?
-He's in the bathroom.

784
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,695
-We should wait so Miyasako sees it too.
-Of course.

785
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,964
-Are we ready?
-Don't we have to flush?

786
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:13,765
It flushes by itself.

787
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,567
There weren't any buttons.

788
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,402
What happens when we take a crap?

789
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,504
Is that why Nobu was talking about pee?

790
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,374
Will you lay off that already?
All you talk about is pee!

791
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,942
It smelled sweet in there.

792
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:25,611
Is someone diabetic?

793
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:26,745
Who's diabetic?

794
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,548
-So, what about that opening gag?
-Oh, that's right.

795
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,984
-I turned my ignition on twice.
-Opening gag?

796
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,519
-I think we can go without.
-Yeah, sorry.

797
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,587
I should abort?

798
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,923
-I turned my ignition on. Twice.
-Sorry.

799
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:40,425
I'll give you another chance.
In four hours' time.

800
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,893
Wouldn't that be too soon?

801
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,928
Four hours' time?

802
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,296
With the current mood...

803
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,432
-Now would be the worst timing.
-You'd take out three players.

804
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,969
I can't hold it anymore.
Can I go to the bathroom?

805
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,437
-Go ahead.
-Uh-oh.

806
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,505
The mic...

807
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,842
-Will we hear her pee?
-Maybe we should talk or sing.

808
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,410
Kurosawa, we'll hear you.

809
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,444
He's right.

810
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:00,846
We'll be able to hear you!

811
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,247
Okay.

812
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,350
-And it doesn't flush properly.
-I don't like this.

813
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,285
Why don't we all go hear and her pee?

814
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,754
-Why would we?
-No, thanks.

815
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,457
I wonder if it's a thin pee or a fat pee.

816
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,859
What's a "fat pee"?

817
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,927
Does it vary day to day?

818
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:20,699
These guys hide too much
behind all that drinking and smoking.

819
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,568
-An elephant pee? A Naumann pee.
-I'll warn them.

820
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,470
-Lose the "Naumann."
-Naumann's elephant.

821
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:26,571
They're extinct.

822
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,073
Is he listening?

823
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,476
Kurochan, that really is creepy.

824
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,711
What is?

825
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,913
-You're listening to her pee.
-No, I'm not.

826
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,982
-What are you doing?
-I'm using the fan.

827
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:39,551
-Why?
-I need a fan because I'm hot.

828
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:43,188
-It's not hot.
-Don't stare into the distance by the fan.

829
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,557
Seriously, you'd better stop it.

830
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,926
Seriously. You're really creepy.

831
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,495
I'm not. Freaks love me.
I beg your pardon.

832
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,164
-We don't need that.
-Huh?

833
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:57,703
-Should I kill him?
-Trying to popularize "I beg your pardon"?

834
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,472
I don't mind his
"I beg your pardon" thing,

835
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,041
but could you stop coming back
with those quips?

836
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,013
The thing about Fujimoto is...

837
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,949
-He makes a contribution.
-He adds a nice sauce.

838
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,751
Yes, it's like a nice sauce.

839
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,886
You make it tasty.

840
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:16,855
A.1...

841
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,759
A.1. Sauce.
It's a sauce they have in Okinawa.

842
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,028
The steak sauce? What's your point?

843
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,530
He was talking about a yummy sauce.

844
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,002
What's that?

845
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,638
-Was that Kurosawa?
-What's he doing?

846
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,574
-Did Kurochan say something?
-What?

847
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,642
Why are you on an angle?

848
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,145
You're listening to Kurosawa peeing.

849
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:41,546
No, I'm not.

850
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,815
-Seriously. Stop it.
-Wait, wait.

851
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,151
Kurosawa and Kurochan make "Double Kuro."

852
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,853
-Can I listen?
-What crap!

853
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,020
Why did you slap me?

854
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:54,760
He's angry because you seriously thought
we would laugh at something like that.

855
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,995
It meant, "Don't take us lightly."

856
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,032
-Is somebody going "ahh"?
-That's scary. They're saying "ahh."

857
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,069
She's drowning out the sound of pee.

858
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,638
But the sound of pee...

859
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,673
-I heard it tinkling before.
-Me too.

860
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,510
It sounded like sparking.
Like she was cutting metal.

861
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,245
Who cuts metal in the bathroom?

862
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,982
Stop using that accent.
It will make me laugh.

863
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,550
-Isn't that a long pee?
-Yeah.

864
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,886
-He should be accent-free by now.
-Right?

865
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,488
When I first met Bunta Sugawara...

866
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,792
-We were in the film The Great Yokai War.
-I remember that.

867
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,595
He was playing the role
of Ryunosuke Kamiki's grandfather.

868
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:34,332
We met at a press conference.
I had second billing.

869
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,935
As the second-biggest star, I greeted him.

870
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,171
He came right up to my face and said,

871
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:40,906
"Who ur ya?"

872
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,108
-That's scary.
-I had second billing.

873
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,011
-He said that all the time.
-"Who ur ya?"

874
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,312
All the time?

875
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:50,715
Time and time again?

876
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,485
"Who ur ya?"

877
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:54,986
Bunta Sugawara said that?

878
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,789
How did you reply to his "Who ur ya?"

879
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,493
-I said, "I'm Miyasako."
-I'm feeling for you, guys.

880
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:03,695
Ouch.

881
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,231
Did he just hit you? Why?

882
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,835
-Why did you hit me?
-Those stories always get me.

883
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,137
-Because your senior was speaking.
-I'm sorry.

884
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,206
-Listen when your seniors speak.
-Sorry.

885
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,441
-Forget about it.
-Sorry.

886
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:20,812
The timing's gone. Forget about it.
I don't feel like talking anymore.

887
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,013
He's super mad.

888
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,483
You missed out on Miyasako's story
about Sugawara.

889
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,019
-The "ur ya" story?
-It was "Who ur ya?"

890
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,156
Is there a more precious story
than Miyasako's tale about Sugawara?

891
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:32,591
Right. Bunta's deceased.

892
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,126
His hairdo was super cool
during his final years.

893
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,964
-It was like Juza of the Clouds'.
-It was cool. Airy and combed back.

894
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:42,434
-Eiko Segawa's hairstyle is cool too.
-She just combs it back.

895
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,401
It's way too long.

896
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,905
If she spiked her hair,
she'd be like Naoki from Laughin' Nose.

897
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,440
-Shut up!
-That's Eiko Segawa.

898
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:50,709
-It's all the same length?
-That's right.

899
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,644
Shut up!

900
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,179
You mean Michizane?

901
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,947
Michizane? Who's that?

902
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,349
We're talking about Bunta.

903
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,618
-He's in trouble.
-Not Sugawara Michizane.

904
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,586
Fujimoto's losing it.

905
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:03,955
Can we cut that out?

906
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,557
Yeah, cut it out.

907
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,893
Building on a joke like that.

908
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,429
Shall we get that opening gag?

909
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:13,365
-No, let's not.
-Not now.

910
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:14,499
We don't need it?

911
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,003
-But his switch is on, right?
-It would feel wrong not to do it.

912
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,138
I wanted him to do it back then.

913
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,740
It's not the right time now.

914
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,308
Maybe later?

915
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:25,977
Well, if you really want to.

916
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,979
Yeah. We're okay either way.

917
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,714
I see.

918
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,249
-Later...
-For...

919
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:36,154
-Why do you sound like Darth Vader?
-I can't breathe...

920
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,822
-You laughed.
-The air's too thin.

921
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,357
-He laughed.
-Right?

922
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,926
That was definitely a laugh.

923
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,895
-You're like Darth Vader.
-No, I'm not. Who's Darth Vader?

924
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,196
Who ur he?

925
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,233
Who ur Darth Vader?

926
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,235
You're not Bunta Sugawara.

927
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,238
Sitting down and Sharon Stone-ing.

928
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:54,539
Right?

929
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,043
Hang on. Did Nobu just laugh?

930
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,412
-Are you sure he didn't?
-Shut up.

931
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,481
-Are you sure?
-We told you not to perform any gags.

932
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,250
-I'm not allowed?
-We told you.

933
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:06,384
We said do it later.

934
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,420
-And you agreed.
-I'll give...

935
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,689
-Was that a rehearsal?
-I'll give you a cue.

936
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,123
Don't start by yourself.

937
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,493
Well, there were problems with the timing.

938
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,728
Just now?

939
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,096
Bad timing?

940
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,798
What was that Michizane thing?

941
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,971
-Sugawara...
-Who's laughing? Who?

942
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,039
-Enough already.
-Nobu?

943
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,374
Was it Yoshizane?

944
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,343
-Who's Yoshizane?
-Was that a laugh?

945
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,978
Sugawara Yoshizane?

946
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,346
That's nobody.

947
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,816
That's not your kind of joke.

948
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:40,552
But that's...

949
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,288
I found that interesting.

950
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,924
-That aspect.
-Michizane...

951
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,094
Does that "Michizane" deserve
so much anger?

952
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,129
He's not angry, just mystified.

953
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,697
It's not like I'm angry.

954
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,001
The joke just didn't feel like you.

955
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:58,436
I found that interesting.

956
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,605
Can you do Sharon Stone again?

957
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:02,640
An encore?

958
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,746
-Why are you drinking milk?
-We ran out of water.

959
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,048
-Liar.
-We have plenty of water.

960
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:11,416
It's gone. Honestly.

961
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,418
-We have plenty of water.
-But...

962
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,253
-There was cabbage and...
-Lower.

963
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,454
At the very bottom.

964
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,257
Sitting down and Sharon Stone-ing.

965
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:20,325
Nothing.

966
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:27,766
No...

967
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,968
I'm not concerned about my calcium.

968
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,669
You're past your growth spurt.

969
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,004
Growssspu?

970
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:35,373
-Your growth spurt!
-What's a "Growssspu"?

971
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,608
Nobu's in danger.

972
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,177
-He's been close the whole time.
-We have water.

973
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:40,678
Nobu and Fujimoto...

974
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:45,283
Kukky's face is lacking tension today too.

975
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,752
We have cold water
and room-temperature water.

976
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:48,820
Down below.

977
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,522
It will stick to your mustache.

978
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,825
No, it won't stick to my mustache.

979
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:54,959
Drink some.

980
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:56,494
Bottoms up.

981
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,731
He drank it in one gulp.

982
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:01,699
It stuck.

983
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,869
-It was your own setup.
-Exactly.

984
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,138
-We can laugh now, right?
-It's okay now.

985
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,139
We can laugh?

986
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:10,608
-That was quick.
-You set it up yourself.

987
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,243
-Wait, wait!
-It was your fault.

988
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,079
-Wait just a second!
-Daigo's out!

989
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,280
-Wait, wait!
-How weak!

990
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:18,216
-Daigo made a full-on laugh!
-That should be a red card.

991
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,617
No, no!

992
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:20,652
Wait, wait!

993
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,120
-It wasn't just a smile.
-No!

994
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,022
-You erupted into laughter.
-But...

995
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,257
It really didn't stick to his mustache!

996
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:27,725
That's not the point.

997
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,027
You blurted out a laugh.

998
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:31,129
-You're right. It didn't stick.
-But...

999
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,531
-I said it would stick...
-Wait. Just a minute.

1000
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,401
Seriously, you're all too loose.

1001
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:37,569
Really?

1002
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:38,937
-Nobu is too loose.
-Okay.

1003
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:41,039
-You're too loose too, Fujimoto.
-Me?

1004
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,174
This time, Kukky is too relaxed, too.

1005
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,409
Sorry, sorry.

1006
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,178
You're all light and fluffy.

1007
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,715
-The atmosphere in here is crazy.
-It is. It really is. It's like...

1008
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,584
Yeah, the atmosphere is bad. I know.

1009
00:45:52,684 --> 00:45:54,419
-It's definitely a bad one.
-I know.

1010
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,655
That Sharon Stone series
was pretty dangerous, too.

1011
00:45:57,856 --> 00:45:59,324
He commended me. Yippee.

1012
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,694
Your saying that means a lot to me.
Thank you.

1013
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,563
-Anyway...
-Back to Daigo.

1014
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:06,865
-Daigo.
-Is it a red?

1015
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,033
-Yellow.
-Yes, I know.

1016
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,401
Let's take a look.

1017
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,071
-He gave you a break.
-It really is a break.

1018
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,707
-Yeah, but...
-That was a total laugh.

1019
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,375
It could've been orange.

1020
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,744
I said, "It will stick."
He said, "It won't."

1021
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,012
It didn't stick!

1022
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,148
That's not my problem.

1023
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:24,682
That's what we have to fight.

1024
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,185
It will stick to your mustache.

1025
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,455
No, it won't stick to my mustache.

1026
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:31,589
Drink some.

1027
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,091
Bottoms up.

1028
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,394
He drank it in one gulp.

1029
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,296
It stuck.

1030
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,633
-It was your own setup.
-Exactly.

1031
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,335
-We can laugh now, right?
-It's okay now.

1032
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:46,304
-See that?
-Wait!

1033
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:47,572
-Wait!
-Nobu?

1034
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,508
-That was just... Mr. Matsumoto...
-That was a laugh!

1035
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,043
That was just, when Daigo...

1036
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,713
When Daigo burst into laughter,
I made a triumphant gesture. That's all.

1037
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,382
It was after the fact.

1038
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:00,518
-I had seen Daigo erupt.
-You thought, "He laughed."

1039
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,655
-I knew he was out.
-I'll judge that one as safe this time.

1040
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,191
Anyway, Daigo gets a yellow.

1041
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:07,625
-Okay.
-Okay.

1042
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,162
The thing is,
if Daigo hadn't burst into laughter,

1043
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,897
probably three more would have.

1044
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,666
-Right?
-If you hadn't...

1045
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,201
What's wrong, Kurosawa?

1046
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,037
-She's crying.
-What's wrong?

1047
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:20,738
She's crying?

1048
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,875
-What is it?
-We can't let people like that in here.

1049
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:26,177
-What is it?
-I can't tell her emotional state.

1050
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,345
What's up, Kurosawa?

1051
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:28,780
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

1052
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,148
We were having fun.

1053
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,817
-Are you crying with joy?
-Does that actually happen?

1054
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:35,353
-What is it?
-Really, what is it? Seriously.

1055
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,155
It's a man's world.

1056
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,124
-"It's a man's world."
-It's a man's world?

1057
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,492
But that's not true.

1058
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,062
-Sorry for being emotionally unstable.
-It's okay.

1059
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:47,232
If we'd said a lot of dirty jokes,
I could understand, but...

1060
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:51,002
I can't join in the conversation.
I'm an only child. I don't have brothers.

1061
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,870
It's no easy feat.

1062
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:54,939
You don't have to force your way in.

1063
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,042
Hamburg!

1064
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,244
He's so noisy.

1065
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,913
-He's too loud.
-He sure has a big voice.

1066
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:05,617
Evil spirit!
I'll drive the evil spirit out of you!

1067
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,720
Evil spirits follow you.

1068
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,093
Why, oh why? Fruity why.

1069
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:21,099
Bonk my eyeball.

1070
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:23,034
-That's scary.
-It's not good.

1071
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,502
It's too scary. Do one more.
