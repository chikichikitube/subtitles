Is this how it ends?

9
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,095
It's sweet.

10
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,497
You put sugar in it, didn't you?

11
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,132
Oshima!

12
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,202

ATSUHIRO TSUDA:
RANKED 8TH MOST LIKELY TO WIN

18
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,156
That's definitely him.

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,724
Use those hips!

20
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,892
No!

21
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,028
Ouch!

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,434
Am I injured?

23
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:46,307
YUKI HIMURA:

24
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,309

TAKASHI YOSHIMURA:
RANKED 5TH MOST LIKELY TO WIN

28
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,073
You laughed, right?

29
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,151
EIJI KOTOUGE

30
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:35,222
SHINJI SAITO

31
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:37,958
I got one!

32
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,262
EIJI KOTOUGE:
RANKED 4TH MOST LIKELY TO WIN

33
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,496
It's Documental?

34
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,232
That's a really tough show
for the performers.

35
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,802
Even though it's incredibly funny
for the viewers.

36
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,839
As far as a plan goes,

37
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,808
I can't spend too much time
just assessing the situation.

38
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,544
That's one thing to avoid.

39
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,612
What I must do is...

40
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,083
I have to go on the offensive.
I have to keep making a move.

41
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,252
Something showed up.

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,422
KEEP MAKING A MOVE

43
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,126
KEEP MAKING A MOVE

44
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,663
SACRIFICE YOUR BODY

45
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,231
That hurts!

46
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,732
God, that hurts!

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,635
Ten million yen, huh?

48
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:25,773
This may sound strange, but I don't
really care about the prize money.

49
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,741
FORGET ABOUT THE PRIZE MONEY

50
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,143
That's not the point.

51
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,345
DOCUMENTAL: THE SHOW OF SELF-SACRIFICE

52
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,646
They're super-stretched.

53
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,382
I started out as an actor.

54
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,185
SHINJI SAITO:
RANKED THE LEAST LIKELY TO WIN

55
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,121
I will create an atmosphere
that only an actor can make.

56
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,656
IS THIS THEATRICAL COMEDY?

57
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,792
I'll have to make them laugh with that.

58
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,528
I'll hold back in the beginning,

59
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,964
and when everyone's spent, I'll attack.

60
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,132
That's a strategy I'll have to refine.

61
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,102
I want to show what I'm capable of
when I go for it.

62
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,340
IT'S TIME TO WATCH
THE FINAL BOMBARDMENT

63
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,475
What a day!

64
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,210
WHAT WILL UNFOLD?

65
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,712
Okay!

66
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,484
IS IT COMEDY, OR VIOLENCE?

67
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,988
A TRUE FIGHT TO THE DEATH

68
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,858
That was an amazing battle.

69
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,429
That's the kind of battle I wanted to see.

70
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,632
THE "BATTLE" WE ALL WANTED TO SEE

71
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,833
Right?

72
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,371
SAITO

73
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,608
VERSUS KOTOUGE

74
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,644
It was magnificent.

75
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,246
THE LEGENDARY 657 SECONDS

76
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,548
This is just really funny.

77
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,384
This is funny!

78
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,654
What the hell's going on at the very end?

79
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:56,330
ATTACK POINTS:
SAITO = 0, KOTOUGE = 3

80
00:04:56,397 --> 00:05:00,401
WILL SAITO MAKE A GRAND COMEBACK?

81
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,405
WILL KOTOUGE HANG ON TO WIN?

82
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,409
OR WILL IT BREAK INTO A FISTFIGHT?

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,048
What should we do?

84
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,725
What do we do?

85
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,168
Restart.

86
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,403
So...

87
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,541
There are only 10 minutes left.

88
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,210
-Let's blast on each other.
-What?

89
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,779
Okay. Bring it on.

90
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,515
Blast on each other?

91
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,089
-It's just you and me.
-Okay, let's do it.

92
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,724
-I'll blast on you.
-You will?

93
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,725
I'll blast on you!

94
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,625
What do you mean?

95
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,095
You want me to blast on you?
I'll blast on you.

96
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,796
Ready? Bring it on.

97
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:04,998
That stinks!

98
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,169
Who would laugh at this?

99
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,004
-Bring it on!
-You bring it on!

100
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,806
Take that!

101
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,442
-Bring it on!
-This is good.

102
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,311
Keep coming up with these.

103
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,148
Want some kimchi?

104
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,317
-Do you want some kimchi?
-Bring it on!

105
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,685
I'll give you some kimchi!

106
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:25,919
Take this!

107
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,490
What a day!

108
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,225
What a day!

109
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,360
-I'll give you kimchi.
-Looking good.

110
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,062
Ready?

111
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,630
Take that!

112
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,165
Wow!

113
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,236
Come on.

114
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,171
Come on.

115
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,672
This is crazy.

116
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,642
Looking good.

117
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,991
-Bring it on, asshole.
-I will, asshole.

118
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,093
Watch out.

119
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,797
Hey!

120
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,001
See?

121
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,804
Saito, you asshole.

122
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,572
What's your problem?

123
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,109
-What's your problem?
-What's your problem?

124
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,445
You think you're hot
since you won King of Conte?

125
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,614
Then do something!
Give me all you've got!

126
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,650
-I already gave all I have!
-Asshole.

127
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,884
You think you're hot?

128
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,120
You have plenty of money!
Let me win!

129
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,454
It's not about the money!

130
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,924
It's about the money!
I want 10 million yen!

131
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,992
-That doesn't matter.
-It does matter!

132
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,529
What are you doing?

133
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:48,869
You idiot!

134
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,974
Don't waste food like that!

135
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,509
Shut up. It's none of your...

136
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,311
I can eat them, too.

137
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,950
This is ridiculous.

138
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,022
-What idiots.
-Bring it on, asshole!

139
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,424
-Eh?
-Huh?

140
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,526
You asshole! Dammit!

141
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,494
-What are you going to do?
-Damn!

142
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,729
Huh?

143
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,030
Damn it.

144
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,333
What will you do next, Saito?

145
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,767
-Eh?
-Huh?

146
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,469
We only have...

147
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,137
There isn't any more time!

148
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,874
-I don't know what to do!
-What will you do, asshole?

149
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,375
Why did I make it this far?

150
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,377
You survived because you were funny!

151
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,146
-I wasn't funny!
-If you're still here, you're funny!

152
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,248
What are you doing?

153
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,282
Yeah...

154
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,619
-Hey!
-What?

155
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,588
-What will you do?
-What will you do, asshole?

156
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,726
That won't work either!

157
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:46,860
What's with you?

158
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,662
Shut up, asshole.

159
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,730
Saito...

160
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,765
Help me out.

161
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,834
Hey. I don't have anything left.

162
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,437
We can keep circling around like this,
but there's nothing left to find.

163
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,072
Shut up. I know, asshole!

164
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,909
-I know already.
-What should we do?

165
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,176
Huh?

166
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,845
What is with you?

167
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:05,812
Huh?

168
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,920
That was a nice move.

169
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,187
Saito.

170
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,689
-Saito!
-What?

171
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,657
Watch this.

172
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,695
That was a nice move.

173
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,733
What's your problem, asshole?

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,469
-Damn you.
-Do you want a fight, asshole?

175
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,971
Look.

176
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,006
-Look!
-What?

177
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,944
See this?

178
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,014
-So what, asshole?
-Huh?

179
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,016
I said, "So what?"

180
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,555
You're going to lose, Saito.

181
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,590
It's all her fault!

182
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:51,825
Old hag!

183
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:52,926
Old hag!

184
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,695
-Old hag!
-Old hag!

185
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,230
This is all the old hag's fault!

186
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,533
Dirty old hag!

187
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,169
-What will you do, Saito?
-Huh?

188
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,871
Just hurry up and lose, asshole!

189
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,340
-No, asshole.
-Asshole!

190
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,741
Huh?

191
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,376
-What is it, asshole?
-What?

192
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,944
-What?
-What's what?

193
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,279
What's what, asshole?

194
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:13,947
-Right?
-Huh?

195
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,215
Huh?

196
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,718
Look, dammit.

197
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,191
Uh-oh.

198
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:26,994
Oh, okay.

199
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,041
That is gross.

200
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,610
What are you going to do,
Saito, you asshole?

201
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,078
That was gross.

202
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,414
-Bring it on!
-There's only five minutes left!

203
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,483
-Come on, asshole!
-Come get some, Kotouge!

204
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,917
What the hell are you?

205
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,386
-Eh?
-Huh?

206
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,287
What will you do?

207
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,190
-Your balls...
-That prop is in the way.

208
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:01,862
Your balls are... Balls?
Should we smack our dicks with that bat?

209
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,663
My balls. Look at them!

210
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,433
-Balls...
-It's winter. They shrunk!

211
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,101
We've come this far.

212
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,170
Damn.

213
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,407
-What will you do?
-Eh?

214
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,875
Huh?

215
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,081
What is it?

216
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,483
Damn. It won't break.

217
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,588
This is all...

218
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:29,756
Hey!

219
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,291
Don't waste good food!

220
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,593
You're right. We'll receive complaints.

221
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,362
That's it. The show's canceled.

222
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,230
The controversy will end the show.

223
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,632
And what about this?

224
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,233
The staff have to clean it up.

225
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,169
-We have to... Hey!
-Huh?

226
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,004
-Saito, you asshole!
-What, asshole?

227
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,372
-Ah!
-Oh!

228
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,940
What will you do, asshole?

229
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,408
-Eh?
-Huh?

230
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,545
-Want to split the prize money?
-Eh?

231
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,347
I'd never split the prize money with you,
asshole!

232
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,717
-There's nothing left to use.
-What should we do?

233
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,553
What is this?

234
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,488
Eh?

235
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
Huh?

236
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,091
What will you do?

237
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,525
Hey!

238
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,594
What will you do about this?

239
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,664
-What will you do?
-What will you do, asshole?

240
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,165
-Huh?
-Yeah!

241
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,500
Well?

242
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,668
Well?

243
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,770
Hey! Look properly!

244
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,804
Hey!

245
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,139
-Hey!
-Ah!

246
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,074
-You're doing good.
-I'm doing good?

247
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,542
How can this be good?

248
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,544
-Take this!
-Take this!

249
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,415
Mine is moaning louder than yours!

250
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,685
How's that?

251
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,520
Take that, you asshole.

252
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,263
The chicken is squawking.

253
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:50,837
That was funny.

254
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,375
Saito was close just now.

255
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,512
-Can you still do this?
-I can. Bring it on. I'm still going!

256
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,647
-Then come on, asshole!
-Laugh, asshole!

257
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,015
Watch this!

258
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,316
Watch this!

259
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,526
That's the thing with Saito.

260
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,062
Why didn't he bring out
this side of himself earlier?

261
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,133
It won't squawk.

262
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,256
I need something else.

263
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,708
Look here!

264
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:07,814
You won't fit.

265
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,416
You won't fit!

266
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,951
You won't fit in there.

267
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,086
Oh, Saito...

268
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,934
That was a good choice.

269
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,971
It really was.
Props that make sounds are good.

270
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,251
This is good. It's really funny.

271
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,685
Right?

272
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,622
It's really funny.

273
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,495
They're doing well. Really well.

274
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,635
What to use?

275
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,437
Isn't there anything left?

276
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,555
Joyman is in a standoff with Joyman.

277
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,527
This is just really funny.

278
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,329
This is funny!

279
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,666
What the hell's going on at the very end?

280
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,305
The "battle for comedians" is
being fought by third parties.

281
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,006
I know what you mean.

282
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,508
I had no idea it was so...

283
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,311
They're saying something.
What are they talking about?

284
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,112
But why?

285
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,815
You know, honey. We're just too...
What should we do?

286
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:49,916
What will we do?

287
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,584
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds?

288
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,153
Thirty seconds...

289
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,387
Time for one more.

290
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,222
It has to be...

291
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,894
This really is quite funny.

292
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,249
Wait, wait, wait. Please...

293
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,218
It's over.

294
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,858
Kotouge is the winner!

295
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,493
Yes!

296
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,461
I did it!

297
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,066
I did it!

298
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,602
I did it!

299
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,707
I did it!

300
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,509
Wow!

301
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,644
Wow!

302
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,848
Is this for real?

303
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,017
Is this for real?

304
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,519
Well!

305
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,487
Saito.

306
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,289
That was amazing.

307
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,992
That last battle of yours was amazing.

308
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,326
-Really?
-Thank you.

309
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,628
It was incredibly funny.

310
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,196
-All right!
-Good job!

311
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,165
We did it!

312
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,167
Wow!

313
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,968
That was really funny.

314
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,404
That last battle was really funny.

315
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,806
-Really?
-Incredibly funny.

316
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,441
Thank God!

317
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:55,875
Seriously?

318
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:59,412
It's a shame Saito tapped into
his full power a little too late.

319
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:00,713
Sorry.

320
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,682
Seriously?

321
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,384
That was amazing.

322
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,619
I think that will go down
in comedic history.

323
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,921
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

324
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,355
We did it!

325
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,625
We did it.

326
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,260
Wow.

327
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,262
-Brilliant.
-We did it!

328
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,498
I did it!

329
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,333
I'm so happy!

330
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,870
It's over. Finally.

331
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,905
Well...

332
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,342
That was an amazing finale.

333
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,011
That was amazing, wasn't it?

334
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,850
Some time has passed since it ended.

335
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,452
But I don't remember a thing.

336
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,255
Seriously.

337
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,891
When it came down to the two of us,

338
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,894
it was like something suddenly
switched on inside of me.

339
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,597
It finally came, but it was too late.

340
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,700
What exactly were we doing?

341
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,101
Was it comedy?

342
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,537
I lost track of things
so badly at the end,

343
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,806
I couldn't even be sure it was comedy.

344
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,476
To be honest, at the end,
I was about to punch Saito in the face.

345
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,145
Seriously.

346
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,251
I almost did. Seriously.

347
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,320
There was madness in that comedy.

348
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,924
I think I can say that was

349
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,530
the most intense time I've experienced
in my entire life.

350
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,205
Things like this really do happen.

351
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,308
At the end,
Saito and I used the same joke.

352
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,144
What are the chances of that happening?

353
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,414
It must be astronomical.

354
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,684
In the very last few minutes,

355
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,620
we were both thinking the same thing.

356
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,723
At that moment,
Saito looked into my eyes and said,

357
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,892
"You're my senior. Please laugh."

358
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,530
But after it all ended,

359
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,833
Mr. Matsumoto said we were amazing.
He said we really were funny.

360
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,335
That's my only consolation.

361
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,272
Kotouge said the same thing, too.
"Those words made it all worthwhile."

362
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,740
That was a tough six hours.

363
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,676
That sure was.

364
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,612
Thank you. Honestly, thank you.

365
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,582
I don't want to leave yet.

366
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,522
That was an amazing battle.

367
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,427
That's the kind of battle I wanted to see.

368
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,363
How can I put it?

369
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,166
It showed what happens

370
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,235
when comedians are really pushed
into a corner.

371
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:43,476
Their ability to just explode was amazing.

372
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,046
How should I put it? That was like sex.

373
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,819
Yeah. It really was sex.

374
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,422
Saito was in a position where
he nearly won with just one point.

375
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,725
Yeah. But he tried so hard...

376
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:03,730
Even if Saito had made Kotouge laugh
in those last few minutes,

377
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,033
and Saito ended up winning
instead of Kotouge,

378
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,936
I don't think anyone
would have complained.

379
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,139
That's how great Saito was at the end.

380
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,807
Indeed.

381
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:18,645
Those two really did their best.

382
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,614
I think one of them is pregnant now.

383
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,486
Seriously. I'm so glad
I was with you at the end.

384
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,655
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Good work.

385
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,791
-Thank you. Thank you.
-It was a pleasure.

386
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,159
-Good work.
-Good work.
