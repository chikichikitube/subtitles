00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:18,386
THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES CONTENT THAT
MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

2
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:22,523
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,229
This time I want to make sure we have

4
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,500
a clear, definite winner to the game.

5
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,906
I want to make it impossible
for passive players to win.

6
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,309
That's the plan this time.

7
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,211
You might call it an improvement.

8
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,516
We will be adding even tougher new rules.

9
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:53,821
I think these new rules will make
what's funny about the show more obvious.

10
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,123
That's how this season will unfold.

11
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,159
That hurts!

12
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,560
That hurts!

13
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,429
That hurts!

14
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,932
If they stop worrying about
structure and order,

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,001
things will get ugly,

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,037
and the game will fall into utter chaos.

17
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,807
That's what I hope to see.

18
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,408
My blow-up doll won't blow up.

19
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,878
You only brought titties
to thish sh-show...

20
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,515
PLAYERS DEFEATED SO FAR:

21
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:32,286
KAZUYA KOJIMA, JIMMY ONISHI,
MIYUKI OSHIMA, ATSUHIRO TSUDA.

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,787
It's sweet.

23
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,091
It's sweet.
You put sugar in it, didn't you?

24
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,759
Oshima!

25
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,530
That's right.

26
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,398
Huh?

27
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,866
What's he doing?

28
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,611
"In Yoyogi..."

29
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,913
At 5:00 p.m.

30
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,616
At 5:00 p.m.

31
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,000
-What is this?
-It's scary. Who is it supposed to be?

32
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,135
No idea.

33
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,103
It's scary.

34
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,406
What is it?
Is he a beer store owner?

35
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,108
-What is it.
-Why does it say "beer"?

36
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,443
We're going to restart.

37
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,779
-What's it based on?
-What's the concept?

38
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,149
Tell us what it is, Yoshimura.

39
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,117
I don't know its concept,

40
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,753
but it came up as the funniest mask
on the Internet.

41
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,922
Why does it say "beer"?

42
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,257
Is he a beer shop owner?

43
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,925
Yes. He likes beer.

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,194
A beer liker.

45
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,363
A beer liker?

46
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,566
If you say so.

47
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,605
-I'm cold.
-Maybe we should put on some clothes.

48
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,839
Yes, you should.

49
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,175
What are you wearing, Saito?

50
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,276
These?

51
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,044
Clothes.

52
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,146
-Your everyday clothes?
-Yes.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,681
Your fashion sense sucks.

54
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,718
You wear that normally? Like, daily?

55
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,286
I do, actually.

56
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,555
Only baseball players wear clothes
like that.

57
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,925
I played Little League,
but they're just easy to move in.

58
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,493
That's an undershirt.

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,061
-It's lame.
-Fujimoto?

60
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,630
My stylist suggested it.

61
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,280
Scary. Scary. Scary.

62
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,448
That really is scary.

63
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,915
That was Saito's fault.

64
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,721
He ruined it.

65
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:30,758
Me?

66
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,593
I totally agree with him.

67
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:37,264
These two had me on the ropes,
but you turned off the pressure.

68
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,234
But his first character
totally missed the mark.

69
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,102
-You don't...
-You're overrating him.

70
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,437
You don't get it.

71
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,672
When I first came out,

72
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,642
I could tell they were
fighting to keep it in.

73
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,544
Then, the mask...

74
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,846
Of course, they didn't laugh.
They'd be out.

75
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,549
Those tits aren't funny at all.

76
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,253
But you came out like you thought
it was really funny.

77
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,320
I watched you.

78
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:05,993
Wait up!

79
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,295
Why didn't you have anything?

80
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,930
What the hell was that?

81
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,865
Himura laughed, right?

82
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,033
No way.

83
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,868
Why didn't you have any joke?

84
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,236
That wasn't right.

85
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,704
You can't do that.

86
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,107
I don't want to be out for that!

87
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,376
I looked for your gimmick,
but you had none!

88
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,611
What the hell was that?

89
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,813
What was it?

90
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,980
What were you doing?

91
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,550
Well, I wanted to do something.

92
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,851
You had something going.

93
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,186
That thing you had going.

94
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,755
Where you were all
dancing around together.

95
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,224
I wanted to jump in,
but you finished without me.

96
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,559
That's not the point.

97
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,594
-But...
-I wanted to join in!

98
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,763
-You came empty-handed!
-I lost the timing!

99
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,831
Himura...

100
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,465
It was me, wasn't it?

101
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,368
But, I think that should be

102
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,970
an orange card.

103
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,171
You're a lifesaver!

104
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,874
I think that's an orange card,
but let us check.

105
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,844
Those tits aren't funny at all.

106
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,014
But you came out like you thought
it was really funny.

107
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,082
I watched you.

108
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,754
Wait up!

109
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,424
Why didn't you have anything?

110
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,360
The next logical step is to give you
an orange card.

111
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,062
-Thank goodness.
-Last chance.

112
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,065
-Next time, I'm out. Okay, thank you.
-No more chances.

113
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,934
-What is humor?
-That's a good question.

114
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,703
-I don't know anymore.
-Exactly.

115
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,171
-Me, too.
-I lost it.

116
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,539
He just came out...

117
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,007
What happened there?

118
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,743
You looked like you'd been
sleeping upstairs.

119
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,882
You came down because you felt peckish.

120
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,118
The worst thing is,
he didn't even try to make us laugh.

121
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,092
-Here we go.
-You're right...

122
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,295
-That couldn't have been helped.
-That was close.

123
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,529
What's this for?

124
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,132
I don't know.
Maybe we could swing it around.

125
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,268
Okay, I'll swing it like this.

126
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,802
Try to dodge it.

127
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,671
-Like this?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,972
Is that a rubber ball?

129
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,208
Will it hurt if it hits us?

130
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,476
I don't know.

131
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,344
Did that hurt?

132
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,213
Not really.

133
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,649
Don't hit him in the ear.

134
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,151
-Is it a rubber ball?
-Yeah.

135
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,520
-Then it should be fine.
-They hurt, too.

136
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,455
Watch out for the ears.

137
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,657
Okay.

138
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,231
Shall we make a rule where we win
if we dodge it five times in a row?

139
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,707
Where did that come from?

140
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,242
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

141
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,177
What would you say about

142
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,379
going back to the vacuum?

143
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,514
Why not?

144
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,349
The vacuum?

145
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,419
I think Jimmy already took the vacuum
to its peak.

146
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,587
-I'm not so sure.
-Can it get funnier?

147
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,091
Himura tried doing something,
and now things have settled down again.

148
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,328
I think now would be a good time
to do the vacuum game again.

149
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,265
But what exactly is the point of
the vacuum game?

150
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,702
You want to suck someone's dick,
then put it in someone's mouth?

151
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,971
Is that the game?

152
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,839
-I'm not sure.
-Me, neither.

153
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,574
Why not suck with our mouths?

154
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,977
Suck what?

155
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,446
Dicks.

156
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,413
You're kidding.

157
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,614
That's too much.

158
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,615
That's too much.

159
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,784
Whispering doesn't make that okay.

160
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,519
If we do that, this becomes porn.

161
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,355
Dicks in mouths is porn.

162
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,322
Who'd laugh?

163
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,124
Oh, it would become one of those?

164
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,994
Sorry, I only had comedy on my mind.

165
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,629
-It would become one of those?
-Yes. Bad idea.

166
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,599
-Then how about this?
-What an idiot.

167
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,201
I came up with a game.

168
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,770
-I brought Akira's act today.
-Whose act?

169
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:37,904
Akira 100%.

170
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,339
His tray act.

171
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,443
He lent me one of the trays
he actually uses.

172
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,745
Wow.

173
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,115
So, I will do Akira's performance.

174
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,183
To win the game,

175
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,952
you have to slurp my balls.

176
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,388
-Come again?
-Akira flips it quickly, right?

177
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,423
-That's the game.
-We aim when you flip?

178
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,893
Whoever is able to slurp my balls
when they're exposed wins the game.

179
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,894
I see.

180
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,462
-Shall we?
-Go for it.

181
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,997
I think it's perfect.

182
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,899
What percent will Kotouge be?

183
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,467
Good question.

184
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,804
-What percent will you be?
-Percent? What do you mean?

185
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,139
Akira is 100%...

186
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,173
You're too close.

187
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,609
-What does he mean?
-Enough already.

188
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:16,877
What percent?

189
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,279
-Because Akira is 100%?
-That was the joke.

190
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,516
-What was that last bit?
-What can I do?

191
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,851
You don't want to do this?

192
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,486
We've had enough of that.

193
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,321
Let's do his thing.

194
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,223
Just wait for him, okay?

195
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,760
-Is he ready?
-I doubt it. Are you ready?

196
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,195
Come out when you're ready.

197
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,698
Akira is so fast when he flips that tray.

198
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,200
Where should we...

199
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,903
Why eat now?

200
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,373
I'm ready.

201
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,109
What are the rules again?

202
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,777
You attack, I defend.

203
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,412
I'll flip this tray around.

204
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,948
-In the meantime...
-I latch onto it, right?

205
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,883
-If you can, you win.
-Okay.

206
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,352
If you fail, my defense wins.

207
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,654
-Okay.
-Okay.

208
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,225
Will this work?

209
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,060
Ready?

210
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,666
Did I get him?

211
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,167
-I think you did.
-Yeah.

212
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,869
But that was...

213
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:16,937
What was that?

214
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,538
That time, I cheated.

215
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,807
I'm supposed to flip it.

216
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,376
But I was too chicken.

217
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,045
I pulled the tray straight back.

218
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,080
Even if you flip it, they'll crash.

219
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,083
-I come from this angle.
-That definitely won't work.

220
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,718
Should we just slurp my balls?

221
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,453
I got it. Let's try this...

222
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,222
Just "slurp" your balls?

223
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,690
That defeats the purpose.

224
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,691
Who slurps?

225
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,993
The tray is in the way, right?

226
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,528
Why slurp your balls?

227
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,196
The tray's in the way, right?

228
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,764
Just squirt my balls.

229
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,566
-"Squirt"?
-Slurp.

230
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,270
What do you mean?

231
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,076
The tray swivels forwards,
so they're always going to smash.

232
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,844
-We'll always hit the tray.
-Yeah.

233
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,213
Maybe you should slide the tray up.

234
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,781
That looks good.

235
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,316
-Wait.
-Let's try it.

236
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,685
Himura, come closer.

237
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,786
Will this work?

238
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,860
I don't like that!

239
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,471
That hurt.

240
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,342
Huh?

241
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,311
-What was that?
-What was what?

242
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,380
We told you to slide the tray up...

243
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,714
I got scared!

244
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,450
Having your balls slurped is scary!

245
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,186
Go like this.

246
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,555
-Then turn like this.
-That makes sense.

247
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,823
Without the tray.

248
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,559
You're getting rid of Akira.

249
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,094
-Let's slurp...
-I want to do Akira.

250
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,729
I want to do Akira!

251
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,632
If we lose the tray,
there will be no Akira in this.

252
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,669
The usual Akira won't work.
That's why we changed the rules.

253
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,872
If we lose Akira's tray too,
this will just be ball-slurping.

254
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,308
I want to do Akira!

255
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:05,245
Okay. Let's put Akira's tray here.
You can stand on it and spin around.

256
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,913
-How about that?
-How about what?

257
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,715
-Stand on it.
-Huh? Stand on it?

258
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,116
-Try it.
-Then spin.

259
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,185
-Now twist to the side.
-Twist.

260
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,020
See? You're Akira.

261
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,889
Have you ever seen Akira do this?

262
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,592
You're just like Akira.

263
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,327
Twist. Twist. Twist.

264
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,528
It works, right?

265
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,096
I dodge the vacuum like this?

266
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,098
You need to twist around farther.

267
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,233
Twist harder.

268
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,434
Twist your hips.

269
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,368
That's it!

270
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,469
I get it!

271
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,338
Great. We can't see them.

272
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,606
Good. Good.

273
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,707
Good. Good.

274
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,475
Let's go with this. It's perfect.

275
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,443
You're Akira.

276
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,811
-Ready?
-I am.

277
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,849
I'm still okay.

278
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,752
Use those hips!

279
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,920
No!

280
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,022
Ouch!

281
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,001
He got impaled on the trunk.

282
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,602
It stabbed into him.

283
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,342
This part dug right into him.
I had the perfect angle.

284
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,745
He hit this part hard.

285
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,981
You have a wound on your back.

286
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,183
-Your back...
-Are you okay?

287
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,919
Kotouge?

288
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,390
Now I'm inhaling helium?

289
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,758
That's mine.

290
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,493
That's mine.

291
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,728
Is this really the time for helium?

292
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,698
-It's not working. You forced it.
-It's your normal voice.

293
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,766
I brought that.

294
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,800
I brought it.

295
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,969
-That's your normal voice.
-Same old voice.

296
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,841
Guys, please.

297
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,444
They keep on making chaos.

298
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,279
I brought one, too.

299
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,983
Saito's at it again.

300
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,651
But I brought one, too.

301
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:52,719
Look.

302
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,655
That's a bruise.

303
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,857
Am I injured?

304
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,593
Am I?

305
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,128
Am I?

306
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,763
Am I injured?

307
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,303
-You've done nothing but get injured.
-Wait a minute.

308
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,514
All he does is injure himself.

309
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,616
The poor guy.

310
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,085
Nothing but injuries.

311
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,891
-It's not that type of battle.
-He keeps hurting himself.

312
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,426
I nearly forgot why I'm here.

313
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,861
Himura...

314
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,330
-That was out, right?
-The decision's made?

315
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,066
He's out.

316
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,341
-He did it again.
-How injured can you get?

317
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,143
Let's look at what happened.

318
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:52,712
Saito's at it again.

319
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,381
I brought one, too.

320
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,448
Look.

321
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,288
Stop injuring yourself.

322
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,624
No more injuries.

323
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,393
Quit injuring yourself.

324
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,295
It was an accident.
I didn't do it on purpose.

325
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,297
It's a bit funny, but I'm worried too.

326
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,633
That's how severe it was.

327
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,102
You've injured your back and your head.

328
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,439
First you got dented, then you bled.

329
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,040
Himura, it's time to leave.

330
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,575
-Bye.
-See you again.

331
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,310
-Good work.
-Good work.

332
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,713
With Himura gone, this is a big chance.

333
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,014
This is getting hot!

334
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,119
That was a weird way to end.

335
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,459
The atmosphere in there was bizarre.

336
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,894
Really bizarre.

337
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,896
Everyone wants to do something, but...

338
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,800
Especially Saito and Yoshimura.
I know they want to do something.

339
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,035
But it's difficult, as you'd expect.

340
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,104
How can I explain it?

341
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,240
You can't do everything you want to.

342
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,377
-The prize money is within our grasps.
-It sure is!

343
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:58,878
Eleven million yen, right?

344
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,346
-That's right.
-Right?

345
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,648
We have to focus.

346
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,083
-We'll definitely have a winner today.
-Perfect!

347
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,152
But you're all hanging by a thread.

348
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,821
Understood. Sorry.

349
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,289
This will be tough.

350
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,723
Real tough.

351
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,329
Here we go.

352
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,966
It's like we're in a traffic jam.

353
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,435
I don't know whether to wait,
or just go for it.

354
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,504
Does that make everybody's voice higher?

355
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,872
Why don't we all try it?

356
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,140
You just press here.

357
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,743
You're doing it wrong.

358
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,680
You need to breathe out first.

359
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,254
This... Huh?

360
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,456
That was pathetic.

361
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,391
-Give it here.
-Let Fujimoto do it.

362
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,665
I had to pinch my nose?

363
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,304
That should work.

364
00:18:58,805 --> 00:18:59,706
Hello.

365
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,275
See?

366
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,979
Was that me?

367
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,115
It might be me.

368
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,185
No way.

369
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,720
Who was it?

370
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,221
My voice is still...

371
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,189
That wasn't me.

372
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,624
-Me neither.
-Who was it?

373
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,459
Actually, I did smirk.

374
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,927
Maybe he's gotten stricter.

375
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,428
-Really?
-Really?

376
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:23,796
It can't be true.

377
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,932
Would you call that out?

378
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,900
I don't know.

379
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,269
Who is it?

380
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,805
Well...

381
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,843
I'm a little suspicious of Kotouge.

382
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,111
But...

383
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,312
For a slight smirk?

384
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,180
But I did make one.

385
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,682
Let's take a look.

386
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,289
That should work.

387
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,790
Hello.

388
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,894
He's a grandfather.

389
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,931
He was looking at his grandchild.

390
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,266
That's the look he gave me.

391
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,235
What a kind, gentle face.

392
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,737
He gave me a big, sweet smile.

393
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,639
Wait! Really?

394
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,142
-He made no sound.
-Good point.

395
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,109
I kept it in!

396
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,446
What's this sense of unity?
It's like you're all on the same team.

397
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,149
-We don't want him expelled for that.
-I see.

398
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,851
-That's how you guys feel?
-He's a comrade in arms.

399
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,553
Indeed, that deserves

400
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,654
an orange card.

401
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,156
That was close!

402
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,524
You're on thin ice.

403
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,592
That was close.

404
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:30,964
I'm cold.

405
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,933
Because you're naked.

406
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,969
Even still.

407
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,770
Restart.

408
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,743
He got me.

409
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,546
-But it was funny.
-I bought two of these.

410
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,014
What?

411
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,683
-Don't you ever have enough?
-Can I try it?

412
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:52,852
I haven't done it yet.

413
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,321
There's no need.

414
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,923
It already worked once.

415
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,459
What's the first step?

416
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,960
Going by his face,

417
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:04,097
I don't think a high-pitched voice
will be very funny...

418
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,132
-It will suit him too much.
-I see.

419
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,634
-But give it a shot.
-Okay.

420
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,302
I exhale first, right?

421
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,672
Let all the air out, pinch your nose,
then suck.

422
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,210
Blow like you're trying to get
all the air out of your lungs.

423
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,079
Don't pinch your nose yet.

424
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,551
Hello.

425
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,555
That's a relief.

426
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,758
-It wasn't funny.
-I told you.

427
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,327
Isn't Yoshimura acting like me today?

428
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,964
You keep honing in on me, but...

429
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,099
He didn't need the teeth.

430
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,435
He's been bombing a lot today, too.

431
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,737
I wanted the straightforward version.

432
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,372
-Me, too.
-Right?

433
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,576
Why did you do that?
The simple version would've been fine.

434
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,480
It was hard to hear you
because of those teeth.

435
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,515
True.

436
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,850
-Exactly.
-That was the problem?

437
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,552
We wanted to hear your voice.

438
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,632
Will Kotouge be all right?

439
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,238
Can I have some tea?

440
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,180
Tea, please.

441
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,552
-That is funny.
-Yes, helium is funny.

442
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,619
It really is.

443
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,122
Comedy needs a gap.

444
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,693
I'll lose the teeth.

445
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,595
-Do it normally.
-Try that.

446
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,497
I think helium loves me.

447
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,633
That's right. Let me do that.

448
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,136
I'll do that... Huh?

449
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,439
It didn't really change.

450
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,874
This doesn't work.

451
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,375
Let me do that.

452
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,443
Do what?

453
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,512
I'm cold.

454
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,380
Huh? Where did I put it?

455
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,582
I'm hungry.

456
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,550
We can do nipple sumo.

457
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,285
Let's do that afterwards.

458
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,125
Do you know this?

459
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,027
-No. What is it?
-You don't?

460
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,763
-Gosso.
-It's Gosso!

461
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,433
-I've never heard of it.
-I was given this at work the other day.

462
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,669
-It's nose hair wax, right?
-It pulls out all your nose hair.

463
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:25,404
It pulls out everything.

464
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,840
Does it hurt?

465
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,176
It hurts a little, but it really works.

466
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,444
Want to try it?

467
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,546
I did it once.

468
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,381
It removed everything.

469
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,917
-How does this work?
-Don't you know?

470
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,919
-You melt them?
-In the microwave.

471
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,388
-Doesn't it get hot?
-You microwave them.

472
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,624
You heat them in the microwave?

473
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,591
That's right.

474
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,293
It's nothing to worry about.

475
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,828
That's twisted.

476
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,464
Heat for two minutes at 700 watts.

477
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,999
We have a microwave. Perfect.

478
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,967
Two minutes. 700 watts. Just as it is?

479
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,135
You add water first.

480
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,370
Water?

481
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,038
How much water?

482
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,673
Add water, heat for two minutes.

483
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,774
Who wants to try?

484
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,309
I don't have much nose hair.

485
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,911
Can I do it then?

486
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,850
Heat this at 700 watts.

487
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,351
For two minutes.

488
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,822
If it's 600 watts, make it four minutes.

489
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,490
700 watts...

490
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:19,892
It's 500 watts.

491
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,127
Will three minutes do?

492
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,895
500 watts? In that case...

493
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,730
-Maybe I'll have a beer.
-Go for it.

494
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,799
Yeah. I'm having a beer.

495
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,637
-500 watts needs five minutes.
-Five minutes? That's quite long.

496
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,906
-Is there no option for 700 watts?
-No.

497
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,409
-What about 600 watts?
-No.

498
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:40,313
There is 500 and 200 watts.

499
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,682
-Only 500 and 200?
-Can we raise this?

500
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,151
-I guess we can't.
-Just go with that.

501
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,619
Five minutes.

502
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,888
It will take five minutes.

503
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,123
Why did you take milk instead of beer?

504
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,192
I want a croissant first.

505
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,965
I'll eat a croissant,
then I'll drink a beer.

506
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,173
Anybody want milk?

507
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:08,574
-Nobody?
-No, thanks.

508
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,610
Has the microwave stopped?

509
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:11,978
It won't work.

510
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:13,646
It's scary.

511
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,415
It stops at 30 seconds.

512
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,351
-Is it broken?
-I wouldn't touch it.

513
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,418
Really?

514
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,555
-It won't work?
-It's scary.

515
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,558
It will work.

516
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:30,763
Huh?

517
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,100
Doesn't that say 200 watts?

518
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,102
It only has 200 watts.

519
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,937
-It said 500 before.
-Really?

520
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,005
Yeah.

521
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,673
Well, this won't work...

522
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:41,941
It's broken.

523
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,710
You laughed.

524
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,712
-Here it comes.
-Is it too weak?

525
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:53,786
Huh?

526
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,087
Who was it?

527
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,758
-Fujimoto?
-He did it. He's gone.

528
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,192
Really?

529
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,961
I did the same thing as Daisuke.

530
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,763
Eh?

531
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,001
I really screwed up.

532
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,837
Are 200 watts funny?

533
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,179
Doesn't that say 200 watts?

534
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,114
It only has 200 watts.

535
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,950
-It said 500 before.
-Really?

536
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,051
Yeah.

537
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:26,719
Well, this won't work...

538
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,987
It's broken.

539
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,426
Why did you laugh so normally?

540
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,394
-What's so funny?
-Please forgive me.

541
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,630
That isn't right.

542
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,866
Well, you have been doing a good job.

543
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,501
You've been on the attack.

544
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,337
I'll give you an orange card.

545
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,039
-Thank goodness.
-But you have no more chances.

546
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,675
-Kotouge, too.
-That's right. I can't slip up.

547
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:50,910
That was scary!

548
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,213
But Saito and Yoshimura
haven't scored any points.

549
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,783
ATTACK POINTS: FUJIMOTO = 3, KOTOUGE = 2,
YOSHIMURA = 0, SAITO = 0

550
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,820
I can't think of anything.
My mind's completely stopped.

551
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,388
You ran out of gas now?

552
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,991
-Things got too nice and cozy.
-You're right.

553
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,460
-I let something like 200 watts get me.
-Sorry.

554
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,729
Saito and Yoshimura have some work to do.

555
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,864
Yes. This is shameful. I'm sorry.

556
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,166
It's shameful. You're five watt comedians.

557
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,368
Hey!

558
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,503
Who are you calling a five watt comedian?

559
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,775
Restart.

560
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,645
I'm in trouble. I have no points at all.

561
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,080
Would you like a croissant?

562
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,318
Fujimoto.
Would you like a croissant, or not?

563
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,053
I'll take one. Are they...

564
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,888
-Are they sweet?
-Yeah.

565
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,002
Look at Fujimoto.

566
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,737
-Want this one?
-I'm good.

567
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,340
-Don't squeeze them.
-Sorry.

568
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,575
Fujimoto, it really does have 500 watts.

569
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,643
It looks good.

570
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,211
Bring me your nose hair!

571
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,380
He can't. It needs a few more minutes.

572
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,948
Should we just do it now?

573
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,051
-You have to melt it.
-It won't work.

574
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,619
Let's all calm down.

575
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,954
Yoshimura, stop being so crabby.

576
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,956
-Me?
-Calm down.

577
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,592
-I'm not.
-He's not being crabby, he's just...

578
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,561
That microwave is too weak.

579
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,196
How strong is it?

580
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,397
200 watts.

581
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,136
Are 200 watts that funny?

582
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,238
-That's weird.
-It wasn't funny.

583
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,307
One minute left. Shall we do it now?

584
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,642
You have to wait!

585
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,810
Why?

586
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,511
Peek inside. Has it melted?

587
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,879
I can't see.

588
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,616
It has to melt first.

589
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,118
I can't see inside.

590
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,287
-How many watts?
-200 watts.

591
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,063
Please stop saying 200 watts.

592
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,531
200 watts?

593
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,036
We have to say 200 watts sometimes.

594
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,539
Enough of that. It's ready.

595
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:02,708
Is it done?

596
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,612
Here it comes. Who wants to go?

597
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,248
Who wants to go? It's melted. Perfect.

598
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,716
That's hot.

599
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,485
Is this safe?

600
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,854
I think it's just going to burn.

601
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,056
It did a good job for 200 watts.

602
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,925
Normally, it would be rock-hard.

603
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,461
Maybe it was the strongest 200 watts
of the batch.

604
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,898
It's one of those 200 watts
that are close to 300 watts.

605
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,701
But it wasn't quite 300,
so they called it 200 watts.

606
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,269
Drop it, already.

607
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,807
Look at what you did.

608
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:38,244
It got all hard while you guys
were talking nonsense.

609
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,545
Is it ruined?

610
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,713
It's fine. Here.

611
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,581
It's still melted!

612
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,216
It's fine. Don't worry.

613
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,752
That's scary.

614
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,290
What is that?

615
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:57,163
Both sides?

616
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,797
That's hot.

617
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:06,839
But, look.

618
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,240
It's dripping.

619
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,777
-Is it working?
-You used too much.

620
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,179
Don't pull them out!

621
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,580
Is this really safe?

622
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,449
I don't know,
but it's getting more than your nose hair.

623
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,218
-It's on his skin.
-It's fine.

624
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,390
He's in trouble.

625
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,125
This is bad.

626
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,526
That is tough.

627
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:28,727
That is really tough.

628
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,488
Is that one minute?

629
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,657
I think that's long enough.

630
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,226
Go one side at a time.

631
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,629
"Once the wax solidifies,
pull them out at once."

632
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,097
Wait. Both of them?

633
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:07,333
Do it one at a time.

634
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,201
I think we should do both.

635
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:10,769
That is amazing.

636
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,305
-That will take its toll.
-This will hurt.

637
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,108
-Gag him. He'll bite his tongue.
-It's three minutes.

638
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:18,077
That hurts. My ears.

639
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,878
They won't come out. Have a feel.

640
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,847
-Look.
-That's rock-hard.

641
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,015
We waited too long.

642
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,817
Wait, I have an ear infection.

643
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,487
Let's pull out his ear infection.

644
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,190
Wait. I can only breathe through my mouth.

645
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,858
I won't pull. It's just...

646
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,326
Look at that.

647
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:35,828
We waited too long.

648
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,062
Look at him.

649
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,567
Look what happened.

650
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,769
I won't pull them out.

651
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,105
Don't worry.

652
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,674
His nose will come off.

653
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,409
See?

654
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,212
This is impossible.

655
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,047
-Don't worry.
-Does it hurt?

656
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,048
Yes.

657
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,249
His nose...

658
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,018
I may have screwed up.

659
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,253
I have an ear infection.

660
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,055
That doesn't change anything.

661
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,690
When my nose is blocked...

662
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,660
What happens? It's just an ear infection.

663
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,861
I can't breathe.

664
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,362
Well...

665
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,197
Somebody pull them. I'm too scared.

666
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,766
I can't do this myself.

667
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,167
I'll do it.

668
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,502
That hurts.

669
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,970
The right one will come out.

670
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,305
Do the right one first.

671
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,574
-They're solid.
-It will come out.

672
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,045
The right one. Pull it right out.

673
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,379
Here goes.

674
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,214
Ready...

675
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:31,050
This is scary.

676
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,117
Go for it.

677
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:36,855
Wow.

678
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,223
It's like a porcupine.

679
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,659
There's one really long hair.

680
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,528
My ear's always infected.

681
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,830
-When my nose is blocked...
-It's that bad?

682
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:45,998
Rip it right out.

683
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,066
This is bad.

684
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,101
Look at him.

685
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,572
Look at him.

686
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,174
It's stuck that strongly.

687
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,243
See? Take a good look.

688
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,014
This is not coming out.

689
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,983
But you have to rip it out.

690
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:08,654
-See?
-You can do it.

691
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,155
It will come out.

692
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,423
Here goes.

693
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,425
Ready...

694
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,962
That has to hurt.

695
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,565
Quit following me.

696
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,600
He moves just by doing this.

697
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,871
Just pull it out.

698
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,039
I feel bad for him.

699
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,173
Wait!

700
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,241
It's coming.

701
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,276
-It will come out. Pull it.
-Please...

702
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,145
Please tell me when you'll do it.

703
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,513
Should we...

704
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,648
But...

705
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:37,916
I'm scared.

706
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,818
-Should we...
-We should...

707
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,720
Let's just do it.

708
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,555
You can do it. Right?

709
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,825
-Help me pull my hand, Fujimoto.
-Okay.

710
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,827
Ready? Here goes.

711
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,030
Look.

712
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,298
Wow.

713
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,135
It's like a porcupine.

714
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,736
You keep bombing with that.

715
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,838
It failed the first time.

716
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,709
Wow. It removes so much hair.

717
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:06,445
-That is amazing.
-It pulls out a lot, right?

718
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,681
Is it okay to lose that hair?
It's a defense mechanism...

719
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,417
He still has a lot left.

720
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,518
My ears...

721
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,919
We should do it again.

722
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,221
-My ears are...
-Don't worry about your ears.

723
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,724
-You're fine.
-You still have a lot of nose hair.

724
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,192
Do I have an ear infection?

725
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,227
-You do.
-Your eyebrows...

726
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,430
Are they drawn on?

727
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,166
-No.
-Your eyebrows are drawn on.

728
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,068
Is that for work or play?

729
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:33,505
-Why draw on eyebrows?
-I drew them on over there just now.

730
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,707
But it wasn't funny, so I wiped them off.

731
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,180
Should we do it again, or not?

732
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,182
-I think that's enough.
-Yeah.

733
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:46,151
Let's move onto the next game. Nipples?

734
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,619
Let's do the nipple thing.

735
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,056
-Nipples, okay?
-How does it look?

736
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,659
-It looks really good.
-Really?

737
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:55,327
Nipple sumo.

738
00:34:56,495 --> 00:35:02,468
This time, I'm attaching importance to
something called Attack Points.

739
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,872
I created a system where you can't win
if you don't attack.

740
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,942
ATTACK POINTS: FUJIMOTO = 3, KOTOUGE = 2,
YOSHIMURA = 0, SAITO = 0

741
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:13,579
If you get in a deadlock, you lose.

742
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,716
I thought we needed to incorporate
a system like that.

743
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,053
I think we will have a winner this time.

744
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,857
My only weapon is the fact
that I went to acting school.

745
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,725
ATTACK POINTS: ZERO

746
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,762
I was trained at the
Bungakuza Theater Company as an actor.

747
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:36,201
I believe that my acting skills
are my greatest weapon.

748
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:39,872
It's all about finding
the right time and place

749
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:42,841
to use my acting skills
and put them on display.

750
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,310
Okay!

751
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:49,548
I'm not sure how skilled
the other members are,

752
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:52,751
but I do believe that's where I'll excel.

753
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,288
I want to use that as my weapon
to make them laugh today.

754
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,724
Why am I here?

755
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,425
ATTACK POINTS: ZERO

756
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,228
Out of all the other comedians,
I want to be the champ.

757
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,163
I want be called "Number One."

758
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,565
Honor. Status. Wealth.

759
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,867
I want Mr. Matsumoto to acknowledge me.

760
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,435
I'm here for all of the above.

761
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,337
Amid all that tension,

762
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,173
in that peculiar environment,
what will I do?

763
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,709
What will they laugh at?

764
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,745
Just thinking about it terrifies me.

765
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,213
This is a nightmare.

766
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,182
Why did he come up with this concept?

767
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,319
-Why don't I have any points? Let's do it!
-Shall we?

768
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,454
Ouch!

769
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,257
Let's get on with this. We have no choice.

770
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,860
Ouch. Why haven't I won a single point?

771
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,462
This isn't me. Dammit.

772
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,232
What an unfunny comedian.

773
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,670
The next 30 minutes
will decide the winner.

774
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,505
You're too slow. That's stalling.

775
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,543
-We have no time.
-Let's get on with this.

776
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,979
Do we need microphones?

777
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,747
-No, we don't.
-Right?

778
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,215
We all have loud voices.

779
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,584
-Right.
-Let's go.

780
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,719
-Just speak up.
-Sounds good.

781
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:01,853
Okay!

782
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,789
-Okay!
-All right!

783
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,457
-What a day!
-All right!

784
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,792
All right!

785
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,728
-Let's do this.
-Stretch out the rope.

786
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,165
Wait! Why attach me first?

787
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,668
We have to attach them at the same time.

788
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,407
Are you sure this won't
rip our nipples off?

789
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:23,342
It really might.

790
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,544
-The line's too short.
-This hurts.

791
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,179
I'll get injured again.

792
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,615
-That hurts!
-It hurts!

793
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,183
I can feel that.

794
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,185
Ouch!

795
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,220
That really hurts!

796
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,589
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

797
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,124
Hurry up and pull them!

798
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,693
Let go of the pins.

799
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,128
Ready...

800
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,763
Ow!

801
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,832
They didn't come off.

802
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,735
How strong are your nipples?

803
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,906
You stretched your nipples.

804
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,441
Look at the skin.

805
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,877
I stretched my nipples.

806
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,580
-They're white.
-They stretched.

807
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:04,316
-What should I do?
-I don't know. Mine don't stretch.

808
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,451
Do stretched nipples go back to normal?

809
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,688
-Are they inverted?
-Stretched.

810
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,790
We have to do it again.

811
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,693
-Wait. My nipples...
-Let's see how far they stretch.

812
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,496
Nipple stretching is embarrassing.

813
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,598
-Let's see what happens.
-Seriously?

814
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,367
Just show us your nipples
as they get stretched.

815
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,136
They're already stretched.

816
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,771
Let's see how far they can go.

817
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,907
I don't want stretched nipples.
Do you want stretched nipples?

818
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,375
I wouldn't like it.

819
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,810
Fine.

820
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,316
I really don't want stretched nipples.

821
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,685
I'm ready!

822
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,987
That hurts!

823
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,055
Stop!

824
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,489
It hurts!

825
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,158
Hurry up and pull it!

826
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,460
They're super-stretched.

827
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,164
Look at Fujimoto.

828
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,433
These won't go back.

829
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,401
These won't go back!

830
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,070
Seriously. Fujimoto.

831
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,305
These nipples aren't going back.
Seriously.

832
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,907
What are you going to do?

833
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,909
-Seriously.
-They'll go back.

834
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,878
They've obviously been stretched.
See?

835
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,714
I have obviously stretched nipples.

836
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,815
They won't go back.

837
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,116
Seriously. They're gone.

838
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,718
Stop it. Seriously. Gone.

839
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:13,852
Seriously.

840
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,922
-Oh, I really don't like these.
-Just push them back in.

841
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,958
-Come back. That's unfair.
-We've had enough nipple sumo.

842
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,427
No way! I'm going to lose!

843
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,063
What about our balls?
Should we stretch them next?

844
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,164
Let's do that.

845
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:27,866
Slow down.

846
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,768
Hey! Slow down!

847
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,505
Okay. Let's stretch them.

848
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,808
Saito, we're going to stretch our balls.

849
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,810
-What?
-We're stretching our balls!

850
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:41,012
-Our balls?
-It's ball-stretch time!

851
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,414
I'll stretch everything.

852
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,283
-Everything...
-It's not prohibited.

853
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,852
But this is crazy.

854
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,421
-That's wrong.
-I did everything.

855
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,957
-You have to stretch them.
-I think I'm too small.

856
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,258
Hey...

857
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,128
-This is too much.
-This is hell.

858
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,430
Don't forget our manners when we stretch.

859
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:00,332
Mine's too small. It will all go in.

860
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,500
Like I said...

861
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,034
And it's winter.

862
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,703
Let's not forget our manners.

863
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,805
I can't do this in winter.

864
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,373
I shrink.

865
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,175
Then...

866
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,012
We're the two weaklings.
We'll fight each other.

867
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,413
We'll find a winner.

868
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,784
We have to stretch them.

869
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,919
-Right?
-Let's stretch them.

870
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,555
-Okay.
-I'll do my balls. You do your nipples.

871
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,457
Why stretch my nipples again?

872
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,993
-Do wherever stretches.
-Where do I stretch?

873
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,262
Wait. Let me strip, too.

874
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:33,832
Oops.

875
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,601
Seeing Fujimoto naked is a rare treat.

876
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,904
What?

877
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,874
Yoshimura?

878
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,510
Yoshimura? Really?

879
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,345
I should be safe.

880
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,550
-Who was it?
-Who?

881
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,753
Was it both of you?

882
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,087
No way!

883
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,757
Who was it?

884
00:40:58,924 --> 00:40:59,925
Who was it?

885
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:05,697
Mr. Matsumoto?

886
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,633
Who was it?

887
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,535
Yoshimura.

888
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,806
I think that was an orange.

889
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,374
-Maybe.
-He gets an orange?

890
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,943
Let's check the tape.

891
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,478
Joyman popped out.

892
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:23,548
So that's what happened!

893
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,250
-It was Joyman.
-Joyman...

894
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,418
How sly!

895
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,455
-You hid Joyman in your underwear?
-Yes.

896
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,825
Where do I stretch?

897
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,661
-Wait.
-It was the way he dropped it.

898
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,071
Okay. That was an orange.

899
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:49,040
That's a valuable point, too.

900
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,575
He got us!

901
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,980
Joyman was stuck to his butt for a moment.

902
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:56,314
It was damp.

903
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,650
And now... We're getting close!

904
00:41:58,717 --> 00:41:59,985
You have 20 minutes left.

905
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,519
Ten million yen, here I come!

906
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,721
Twenty minutes?

907
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,157
It's 10 million yen. Imagine that.

908
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,260
Ten million yen in 20 minutes?

909
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,830
ATTACK POINTS: FUJIMOTO = 4, KOTOUGE = 2
YOSHIMURA = 0, SAITO = 0

910
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:14,733
-Ten million yen in 20 minutes.
-I'm in trouble!

911
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,135
That was a valuable point for Fujimoto.

912
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,545
-What now?
-What shall we do next?

913
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,881
What can I do?

914
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,552
-Let's play something.
-Why not? I'm up for it.

915
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,254
We should do something.

916
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,923
We can play look-this-way.

917
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,958
Okay. How about green-peas?

918
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:41,126
Green-peas.

919
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,961
The rock-paper-scissors variant?

920
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,729
-That's it.
-I remember that.

921
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:47,198
There are a lot of different rules, right?

922
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:50,101
But I know the basics of green-peas.

923
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,237
Okay.

924
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:54,539
Let's finish this off with a bang.

925
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,308
-Shall we begin?
-Let's go.

926
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,076
I'm so nervous.

927
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,912
-Will green-peas do?
-Are you in the lead?

928
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,514
-I don't know.
-I think he is.

929
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,349
Especially since he just scored.

930
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,017
No way. I might lose.

931
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,687
Let's do it. Green-peas. Ready...

932
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,388
Why play green-peas?

933
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,090
Ready, go. Green-peas!

934
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:13,658
Green...

935
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,160
Is he laughing?

936
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,430
-Green-peas?
-Hmm?

937
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,635
Fujimoto is in trouble.

938
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:25,337
How about a thumb war?

939
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:27,739
Shall we?

940
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,407
How about a soda chug challenge?

941
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,409
-Let's do that.
-What about green-peas?

942
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:32,944
Who would play green-peas?

943
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:34,946
Really?

944
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,849
Fujimoto, let's play green-peas.

945
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,784
Green-peas...

946
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:41,553
Fujimoto, don't run away.

947
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,855
I'm not.
We're doing the soda chug challenge.

948
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:46,191
Here's the soda. Now we're ready to go.

949
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,459
In how many seconds?

950
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,260
Let's all drink it together.

951
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:50,895
-The fastest guy wins?
-Okay.

952
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,098
-Let's do it.
-Fastest guy wins.

953
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,566
-Okay.
-Let's go.

954
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,902
These are cold.

955
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,104
Let's do it.

956
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:05,877
Is this okay?

957
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,047
-Is what okay?
-We only have 17 minutes left.

958
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,081
Let's go for it.

959
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,282
So, we're chugging?

960
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,884
We're not playing green-peas?

961
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,586
There are only 17 minutes left.

962
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,289
Ready... Go!

963
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,100
That was a really low move.

964
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,601
What did I do?

965
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,738
-Joyman.
-Yeah, well...

966
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,482
Fujimoto.

967
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,685
Seriously? Is that it?

968
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,454
-Seriously?
-For real?

969
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:23,955
No.

970
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:25,056
No!

971
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,091
No way!

972
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,258
No, no, no!

973
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,960
I don't want to lose now!

974
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,428
What a waste!

975
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,964
-No way!
-Such a waste.

976
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,566
-Fujimoto?
-No, no, no!

977
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:35,800
Stop! No!

978
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:36,968
Don't do it!

979
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,079
What was so funny?

980
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,380
This!

981
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,817
Wherever I looked, I saw Joyman.

982
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,753
He was even under the bottle.

983
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,589
What a waste!

984
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:01,860
-Revenge of the Joyman.
-I was sure you'd win.

985
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,062
-Seriously?
-Revenge of the Joyman?

986
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,697
Let's take a look.

987
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,100
But you laughed all the way through
that soda bit.

988
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,646
He had Joyman on the bottom.

989
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,516
That's pretty definite.

990
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,787
-I couldn't stop.
-He got stuck.

991
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:30,955
I kept laughing.

992
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:34,592
-At that point, I pretty much gave up.
-Yeah. You gave up.

993
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:36,427
What a waste.

994
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,296
You had nearly sealed the deal.

995
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,932
Did I nearly have it?

996
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,433
-You did.
-Really?

997
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,236
This is so frustrating.
I don't want to leave now.

998
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,805
All because of that? Damn you, Joyman!

999
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,211
Joyman...

1000
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:54,379
He's everywhere!

1001
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:55,880
What's with that? Seriously.

1002
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:57,582
Let's go.

1003
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:58,750
Okay...

1004
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,819
-Good work.
-Nice fight.

1005
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,454
-Leave it to us!
-Okay.

1006
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,157
That's so frustrating!

1007
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,228
That's going to sting for a while.

1008
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:11,863
For quite a few days.

1009
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,365
I think...

1010
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,269
I was just about to win 10 million yen.

1011
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,906
That thought must have crossed my mind.

1012
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,909
I think that broke my concentration.

1013
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:28,980
My concentration must have slipped,
ever so slightly.

1014
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,782
Yeah.

1015
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:37,655
Restart.

1016
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:42,994
So, we should...

1017
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,764
What should we do?

1018
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:50,068
-I can't let it end like this.
-Yeah.

1019
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,004
I have to do something.

1020
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,305
Should we...

1021
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,908
-Want to play a game?
-A game...

1022
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:59,777
-We need to stay on the move.
-Let's keep moving!

1023
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,616
I have an interesting way of jumping rope.

1024
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,184
-Jump rope?
-Yes.

1025
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:14,759
Kotouge.

1026
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:37,348
Kotouge doesn't do well
in situations like this.

1027
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,417
If I don't do something, I'll lose!

1028
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:08,746
Old hag!

1029
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,159
Huh?

1030
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:22,694
Me?

1031
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,761
Really?

1032
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:25,930
Are you serious?

1033
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:27,198
What happened?

1034
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,639
It's probably me.

1035
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,508
Yoshimura.

1036
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:40,678
That means...

1037
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,682
You laughed, right?

1038
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,989
When he spat water on that old hag,

1039
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:54,392
almost all of it ricocheted onto me.

1040
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,761
All of it.

1041
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,896
He spat at a completely different angle.

1042
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,466
But I got all the water.

1043
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:02,633
It was like...

1044
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,635
It was like a miracle.

1045
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,237
Don't call her an old hag.

1046
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,043
Old hag!

1047
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,011
That was it.

1048
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,948
This can't be true.

1049
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,350
-It just started to...
-What a waste.

1050
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:22,420
I didn't expect Yoshimura
to drop out here.

1051
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,055
Yoshimura...

1052
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:25,456
Dammit.

1053
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:27,925
How pathetic. I didn't do a thing!

1054
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,694
That isn't true.

1055
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,363
I am so disappointed.

1056
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,598
You must be.

1057
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:34,832
We all are.

1058
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,535
-Ready to go, Yoshimura?
-I'm sorry.

1059
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:38,770
Let's go home.

1060
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:43,708
-There are only a few minutes left.
-For real?

1061
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,143
Do your best.

1062
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,183
That was pathetic.
I wasn't able to do anything.

1063
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,286
I'm thinking, maybe I should quit comedy.

1064
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,422
I am so disappointed.

1065
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,458
Why was Joyman the only thing
that worked today?

1066
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:03,227
He was my sole weapon.
I'm so disappointed.

1067
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,764
That was a thorough loss.

1068
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:08,032
There's no excuse.

1069
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,634
I wasn't talented enough.

1070
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,437
I deserve to lose a million yen.

1071
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:15,940
NEXT EPISODE

1072
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,976
SEASON 2 FINALE

1073
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,045
Who would laugh at that?

1074
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:22,747
-Bring it on!
-You bring it on!

1075
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:37,295
A CHAMPION WILL FINALLY BE BORN

1076
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,798
That's the kind of battle I wanted to see.

1077
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,835
Right?
