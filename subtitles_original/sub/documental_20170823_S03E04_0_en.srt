00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:22,590
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,527
Kasuga is amazing, isn't he?

4
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,699
It may seem like he's just our puppet.

5
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,502
We give him the ideas.
 We tell him what to do.

6
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,705
But his ability to fulfill those requests
 is incredible.

7
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,808
He's always there with
 just the right intensity.

8
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,144
He's mind-blowing.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,012
Even just listening to his voice

10
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,314
is enough to crack me up.

11
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:53,721
My groin has never been featured
so much in my whole life.

12
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,956
-It fits right inside.
-It's curry rice.

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,360
That's too much.

14
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,296
Nobody can keep a straight face at that!

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,501
I actually feel as though

16
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,873
I've now gone on to
a higher level as a comedian.

17
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,010
-Show us again.
-Where is it?

18
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,278
It's right here.

19
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,582
LAST EPISODE'S LOSERS:
RG, TERUMOTO GOTO, YOSHIMASA IWAHASHI

20
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,850
RG, red card!

21
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,588
-Are you moving the markets to Toyosu?
-Not anymore.

22
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,259
-Really? Where will it go?
-Jakuzure.

23
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,963
Goto, red card!

24
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:49,136
LAST EPISODE'S LOSERS:
RG, TERUMOTO GOTO, YOSHIMASA IWAHASHI

25
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,011
Iwahashi!

26
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,379
Red card!

27
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,648
I'm finished!

28
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,858
-Here we go.
-Okay.

29
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,192
Ready, start.

30
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:47,494
Yamamoto.

31
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,366
There's something
I never quite understood.

32
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,702
Why did you take time off?

33
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,036
-Me?
-Yes.

34
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,742
Do you really want me to tell you?

35
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,243
I never heard why.

36
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,781
I just stopped seeing you on TV.

37
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,451
-It happened in 2006.
-Okay.

38
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,421
I tripped up.

39
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,623
You tripped up?

40
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,124
You fell over?

41
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,959
Down the stairs?

42
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,161
-Not exactly.
-Okay.

43
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,272
It was exactly 11 years ago.

44
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,240
Okay.

45
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,408
I was...

46
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:35,809
I just...

47
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,977
What does that mean?

48
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,279
Did you do something?

49
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,949
I suppose you could say
that I did something.

50
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,684
What did you do?

51
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,590
Sexual misconduct.

52
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,799
What do you mean by "sexual misconduct"?

53
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,933
Akiyama.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,869
He's in trouble already.

55
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,173
-Sorry for bringing it up.
-No, not at all.

56
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,281
What are you sucking on?

57
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,783
Those pills from before.

58
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,894
No, no, no.

59
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,629
-Akiyama?
-Probably.

60
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,531
-Why?
-I'm in trouble.

61
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,902
Seriously, he's been sucking on
those pills the whole time.

62
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,204
-Don't you have a few?
-A few what?

63
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,272
Cards.

64
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,507
Seriously? That wasn't anything...

65
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,876
-Is that an orange?
-I thought I'd be fine.

66
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,812
But when I saw those two dots...

67
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,081
I really am still sucking on them.

68
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,517
But how could you still be sucking on
those pills?

69
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,786
The atmosphere was great there.

70
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,521
It was a good atmosphere, right?

71
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,491
That's what we want.
There was tension in the air, too.

72
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,893
And Kasuga has been away the whole time.

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,730
The fact he's been away the whole time
is what's funny.

74
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,999
He can't stop fiddling around.

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,267
Let's take a look.

76
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,572
What are you sucking on?

77
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,073
Those pills from before.

78
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,914
That was Akiyama's laugh.

79
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,583
When you think about it,

80
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,753
the fact he's still sucking on
those pills is really...

81
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,454
-That bit ended ages ago.
-Right?

82
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,190
Chewing them was part of the joke,
but he didn't chew.

83
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,125
I know.

84
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,126
Damn!

85
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,227
Akiyama, red card!

86
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,802
-Damn!
-It's getting real now.

87
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,170
It sure is.

88
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,405
You really do have a chance of winning.

89
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,341
Less than two hours remain.

90
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,310
-Don't come back as a zombie.
-I will return as a zombie.

91
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,979
Don't return as a zombie.

92
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,715
-Don't come back.
-I will. As a zombie.

93
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,151
Don't you forget it.

94
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,224
I'm so disappointed and frustrated
right now.

95
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,060
I still had a lot of tricks in my bag.

96
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,364
It feels like I didn't give it
everything I could have.

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,665
This is so frustrating.

98
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,003
But there really was nothing
that I could do.

99
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,406
You can try to hold back,
but when it's funny, it's funny.

100
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,179
My whole body started to crack up.
It was impossible.

101
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,318
It's time to restart.

102
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,122
When will the zombies...

103
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,864
-It's a little bleak in here now.
-Yeah. Things were more lively before.

104
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,900
-Has it begun?
-Yes.

105
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,037
What is he doing? Seriously.

106
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,706
He decided not to wear that top?

107
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,376
Actually, he gave up on wearing
 that whole outfit.

108
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,612
That Roman gladiator look.

109
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,048
He decided on a cowboy. No?

110
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,352
If Kasuga doesn't hurry up,
we'll never get to do Zombie Time.

111
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,222
He put on that hat again. After all this.

112
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,391
He really wants to wear
 that hat, apparently.

113
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,796
Now it's off again. He changes his mind.

114
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,499
Then he picks up something else.
 And he'll put it back down.

115
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,869
Come on, Kasuga.

116
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,271
This is funny too, but look.

117
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,139
Now he's got that back on.

118
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,843
He was wearing a matching top before,
 but he took it off.

119
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,880
And what's that thing around his neck?
 That protector thing.

120
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,681
You're going with that, right?

121
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,884
You'll go back, right?

122
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,786
Let's go with that.

123
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,888
Come on.

124
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,090
You changed your mind?

125
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,892
What's his problem?

126
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,494
Seriously. What is with him?

127
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,897
He's been doing this for ages.

128
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,833
You've made up your mind?

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,535
Okay. Bring it on.

130
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,042
Huh?

131
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,244
Where is Akiyama?

132
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,147
He left while you were gone.

133
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,049
Oh, he's out?

134
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,654
That's too bad.

135
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,822
-Can I say one thing?
-Sure.

136
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,592
You were away for so long just for that?

137
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,793
Exactly.

138
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,728
Yes.

139
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,632
-Did you tweak your neck?
-What happened?

140
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,168
-I sort of tweaked my neck.
-How?

141
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,737
-That held me up, too.
-You were gone for ages.

142
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,573
-My helmet was...
-It was nearly half an hour.

143
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,608
Yes.

144
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,177
I couldn't choose between
this and my Cuban hat.

145
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,679
If we're all ready,

146
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,715
I would like to start Zombie Time.

147
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,650
Let's start!

148
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,853
Zombie Time!

149
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,889
Here they come!

150
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,758
What's going to happen?
And how long will it be?

151
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,596
This is bad.

152
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,168
-There they are.
-Yes?

153
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,170
-The zombies are here.
-Yes?

154
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,038
Who is it?

155
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,240
Welcome to "Now and Then."

156
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,380
I'll have hayashi rice.

157
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,654
Long time no see.

158
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,156
Hayashi...

159
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:24,758
rice.

160
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,626
-Kobayashi?
-Coffee, please.

161
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:27,561
Coffee.

162
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,230
-Iced coffee too, please.
-Iced.

163
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,732
-Make mine hot.
-Hot.

164
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,567
I wrote "hot" with the orange pen.

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,268
I wrote "iced" with this one.

166
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,438
He's laughing to make them laugh.

167
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,873
What a prick.

168
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,908
Is that why you have so many pens?

169
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,113
Who is this?

170
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,215
-He's a gladiator.
-Gladiator?

171
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,384
Mr. Gladiator.
It's your first time, right?

172
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,152
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

173
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,587
Are you the warm-up?

174
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,956
Are you today's warm-up act?

175
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,659
What do you want to eat?

176
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,530
What do you want?

177
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,434
-I'll take an iced coffee, please.
-Iced coffee.

178
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,836
You could have Kilimanjaro coffee.

179
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,607
-An iced coffee will do.
-Iced coffee.

180
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,208
-Iced coffee.
-Iced coffee.

181
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,578
Okay.

182
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,782
Long time no see.

183
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,285
Long time no see.
I've been watching you in that drama.

184
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,720
What would you like?

185
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,388
-Yakisoba, please.
-Yakisoba.

186
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,091
I use two colors to write "yakisoba."

187
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,628
Yakisoba...

188
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,329
He is so annoying.

189
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,802
Let me check that.

190
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,104
-We have one hayashi rice.
-Right.

191
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,140
-Iced coffee... Hot coffee. Iced coffee.
-Yes.

192
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,909
And yakisoba, right? Okay.

193
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,111
Thank you.

194
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,446
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

195
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,282
Punk Booboo said that
you didn't give them oranges.

196
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,584
Punk Booboo, right? Those guys.

197
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:01,655
If they tried a little harder
I would give them some, but not yet.

198
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,491
So, Punk Booboo want what?

199
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,293
-To be on your orange list.
-Okay.

200
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,828
Okay.

201
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,196
You think they're safe?

202
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,399
-I'll be right back.
 -They all made it? Okay.

203
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,837
That was close.

204
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,409
Zombie Time is scary.

205
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,244
RG is pushing that impression.

206
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,446
-He looked just like him.
-He sure did.

207
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,014
Just like him.

208
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,218
-He really said that to me this morning.
-When you arrived?

209
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,086
-"Long time no see."
-The owner did?

210
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,488
-At "Now and Then"?
 -Yeah.

211
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,757
For some reason,
he always knows when we'll arrive.

212
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:41,394
He always wanders around in that area
at the entrance to the studio.

213
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,863
Okay, let's go for it.

214
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,898
At this timing.

215
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,802
Zombie Time!

216
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,744
They might come together.

217
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,146
Here we go.

218
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,520
Hello, I'm Terence Lee.

219
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,792
I brought a teddy bear with me today.

220
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,461
Teddy Bear.

221
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,363
Come in, Teddy Bear.

222
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,498
Kasuga is in big trouble.

223
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,533
Come on.

224
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,003
It's okay. Don't be shy.

225
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,038
-Daddy!
-Come inside.

226
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,574
-Daddy!
-Come on, Teddy Bear.

227
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,109
How cute.

228
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,411
You're so cute.

229
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,415
-That's bad!
-That's really bad!

230
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,717
Wait a minute!

231
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,253
-That was wrong.
-Wait! That was too much!

232
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,088
Who was it?

233
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,957
It must be Kobayashi.

234
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,660
-It was Kobayashi, right?
-Yeah, it's Koba.

235
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,628
-For starters.
-That really was...

236
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,766
Yay!

237
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,534
Wait. That was Kobayashi, right?

238
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,503
I know how you feel. This is too much.

239
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,404
We got him.

240
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,473
-We did it.
-They are too much.

241
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,910
-Give us a break.
-I made it this far!

242
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,378
There were two people.

243
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,614
They will both leave.

244
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,749
-Wow!
-That was powerful.

245
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,084
Kobayashi and Kasuga!

246
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,486
-Damn!
-Red card!

247
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,423
-Damn!
-I held out for so long!

248
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,624
Damn.

249
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,192
I really messed up.

250
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,566
Zombie Time really is dangerous, right?

251
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,969
The very idea of "Zombie Time"
made it worse.

252
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,472
Firstly, let me say it was amazing
that you withstood "Now and Then."

253
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,674
-I couldn't do it.
 -You held on well.

254
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,742
That was impossible.

255
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,477
So, let's take a look.

256
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,080
It's okay. Don't be shy.

257
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,049
-Daddy!
 -It was already too funny at this point.

258
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,584
Come on, Teddy Bear.

259
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,152
How cute.

260
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,091
That was a blatant laugh.

261
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,593
Why did you have to walk like an old lady?

262
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,229
Now let's look at Kasuga.

263
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,297
Really?

264
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,399
It's okay. Don't be shy.

265
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,434
-Daddy!
-Come inside.

266
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,570
-Daddy!
-Come on, Teddy Bear.

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,171
How cute.

268
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,510
-Is that out?
-Well, yes.

269
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,179
-You're right. I laughed.
-You sure did.

270
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,981
-They got me.
-You exploded.

271
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,818
So, less than an hour and a half remains.

272
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,588
-I lasted for so long.
-Only two people left.

273
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,358
But this also means that both
Kasuga and Kobayashi can become zombies.

274
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,227
-We'll have more Zombie Time?
-Yes.

275
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,897
If the zombies take everybody out,
we get our million yen back, right?

276
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,100
-That's right. It will be a "No Contest."
-Let's aim for that.

277
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,302
Okay!

278
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,370
That was too funny.

279
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,506
We did it.

280
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,410
I think it's a shame that we didn't
get to see more of them,

281
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,778
but that's enough for now.

282
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,613
Nice zombie work.

283
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,550
On a serious note about
a somewhat technical matter,

284
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,752
Goto was eliminated, right?

285
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,523
When I thought about who would
initiate the conversations without him,

286
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,592
out of the guys left,
I thought I had to take that role.

287
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:04,297
So, I started having these weird,
extra thoughts going through my mind.

288
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,132
-Can I say one thing?
-Sure.

289
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,435
You were away for so long just for that?

290
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:15,008
I had to provide Goto-like jabs.
Like "Hey, what's that?"

291
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,813
In the end,
I guess I lost my concentration.

292
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,981
It's a shame.

293
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,353
If someone wins this competition,

294
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,988
I won't get my million yen back.

295
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,192
All I can do now is try to get that back.

296
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:37,263
But now I know exactly how frightening
Zombie Time can be for the players.

297
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,500
Compared to when I was
just one of the players,

298
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,002
I think I'll be able to
go on the offense more.

299
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,371
Come on, Teddy Bear.

300
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:45,905
How cute.

301
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,174
You're so cute.

302
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,443
The pressure was unreal.

303
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,312
But I can't believe it.

304
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,282
I thought only Kasuga could make me laugh.

305
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,451
Kasuga--

306
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,623
Let's go.

307
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,360
This is not good.

308
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,661
We're on!

309
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,634
-This is a strange pairing.
-We're not on Zombie Time, right?

310
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,036
This sure is tough.

311
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,407
Maybe I shouldn't just wait.
Yeah, I can't just wait.

312
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:26,179
The next time Yamamoto laughs,
 Kinoshita will win right then and there.

313
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,155
That really is amazing.

314
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,429
-This is bad.
-This is really bad.

315
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,763
They're scary.

316
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,133
The zombies seem to be having fun.

317
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,171
We still have a long way to go.
One hour and ten minutes.

318
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,606
There's still a full hour.

319
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,414
Okay!

320
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,450
This is an opportunity, right?

321
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,584
Let's bring it on.

322
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,752
I'll bring it on.

323
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,889
He has no idea what to do.

324
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,326
He wants to be that little bit funnier.

325
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,698
He's trying to make himself
 that little bit funnier.

326
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,805
And what is Kinoshita doing
 on his side of things?

327
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,586
He is completely lost.

328
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,989
I have no idea what to do.

329
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,925
None at all.

330
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,193
Yamamoto?

331
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:21,928
Did you cut this?

332
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,332
-It's Sento-kun.
-Did you cut this?

333
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,568
-No, I didn't.
-Look at it.

334
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,804
-What?
-It's totally ruined.

335
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,777
You cut it, right?
When you were back there.

336
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,045
I didn't cut it.

337
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,447
It's in tatters.

338
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,283
Completely shredded.

339
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,255
How could you?

340
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,991
-I didn't do it.
-You can't do this. It's so wrong.

341
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,459
Honestly, I didn't cut it.

342
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,028
Then what is this?

343
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,698
I don't know.
But I haven't even touched your locker.

344
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,337
The whole thing is...

345
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,944
This was my funniest bit.

346
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:16,015
Yamamoto seems to be on the ropes.

347
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,184
You have a croissant-like thing there.

348
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:30,563
I think we should put all of this on hold
for a moment.

349
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,932
This isn't right.

350
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,401
I think we should stop filming.

351
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,203
It's been shredded.

352
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,774
We'll end up with no rules in here at all.

353
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,643
I can see that croissant thing.

354
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,111
This isn't about croissants.

355
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,082
He held it in.

356
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,151
That was close.

357
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,021
Does everybody shave down there?

358
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,233
He's back.

359
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:11,604
One hour left.

360
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,306
There's still plenty of time.

361
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,009
There is, but there are only two of us.

362
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,610
-You're right.
-Right?

363
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,946
-Do you want to do that?
-Shall we?

364
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,648
There are two of them.

365
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,350
-Shall we zap each other?
-Okay.

366
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,553
Is there any point to doing that?

367
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,061
Where do you want it?

368
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,497
Wherever you want.

369
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,035
But isn't this place the only option?

370
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,081
It's a little strong.

371
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,582
-Too strong?
-Yes.

372
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,120
Yamamoto?

373
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,057
-Don't laugh at something like this.
-That's not good.

374
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,059
Not now. Not at something like this.

375
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,396
-This is "squeeze."
 -No good?

376
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,631
Is it squeezing?

377
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,066
Wait!

378
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,903
-It's on "squeeze."
-Wait.

379
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,138
Any stronger than that will...

380
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:21,774
It's kind of strong.

381
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,010
That's a bit...

382
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:27,046
Doing that is only going to put
 Yamamoto under pressure.

383
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,581
This is "tap."

384
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:32,285
Yamamoto, think about it.
You're not attacking him there.

385
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,187
You are the one being attacked.

386
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,656
Are you aware of that?

387
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,825
That's a bit strong.

388
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,294
The offense and defense are
 the wrong way around.

389
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,796
-This is level eight.
-Can you turn it down a bit?

390
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,831
This is seven.

391
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,967
This is level seven "knead."

392
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,570
From level seven to...

393
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,706
level 10!

394
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,210
There is no way Kinoshita
 will laugh at this.

395
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,850
Level seven "knead."

396
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,351
Yamamoto?

397
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,689
Yamamoto. Watch out.
 You have a slight smile.

398
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,693
Yamamoto, you have a slight smile.

399
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,528
Seriously? Do you get this?

400
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,296
That's definitely not a good idea.

401
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,698
What if I use the timer?

402
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,700
That's not the point, Yamamoto.

403
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,102
That will give us a time limit.

404
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:27,073
You should be asking him
to do that to you.

405
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,977
-This is "tap."
 -See? He's going to make you laugh.

406
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,979
Is he okay?

407
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,553
Yamamoto. Are you okay?

408
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,388
-Cut that out.
-Level nine.

409
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,589
-That hurts!
-"Knead."

410
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,991
Level nine, "knead."

411
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,000
-Seriously, that's enough.
-It's on four now.

412
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,402
Enough. No more.

413
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:59,305
-What is he trying to do?
-Okay, let's take a break.

414
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:01,507
I'm exhausted.

415
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,177
But you look healthier.
It helps your circulation.

416
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,078
-Is that what this does?
-Yeah.

417
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,915
It should be good for you.
They're low frequency waves.

418
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,249
Well, that's my theory.

419
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,885
-I may be wrong.
 -What the hell?

420
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:14,854
I am so tired.

421
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,491
Hey. Hey!

422
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:19,826
Again?

423
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:23,362
He's really shaking now.

424
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,097
Can you really stand this?

425
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,067
Do you really think you can win with this?

426
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,770
You have no more lives.

427
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,740
See? Look what happened.

428
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,076
Now Kinoshita can do whatever he wants.

429
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,545
-He could be faking this.
-I'm done for.

430
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,317
See? He could be faking that.

431
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,857
What the hell is this?

432
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,559
-I can't take this anymore.
 -Yamamoto?

433
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,595
-Don't you get it?
-I give up.

434
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:56,929
Don't you?

435
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,631
-Sorry.
-Not yet.

436
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,734
But Yamamoto seems okay.

437
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,036
As far as this bit is concerned.

438
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,641
I don't know about Kinoshita, though.

439
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,143
Yamamoto won't laugh.

440
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,780
Yeah, he's okay. He won't laugh.

441
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,388
Yamamoto...

442
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,733
What are they doing?

443
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,867
Please! It hurts!

444
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,602
That hurts! It really hurts!

445
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,040
-Can I wipe my sweat?
-Sure.

446
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,676
That is amazing.

447
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,047
This is the real thing.

448
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:49,982
Need a towel?

449
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,518
Thank you.

450
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,188
They're building a nice relationship.

451
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,190
Let me attach it first.

452
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,032
Okay.

453
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,568
-It goes to ten. These are the levels.
-Is this "tap"?

454
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,270
That's "tap."

455
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,706
-I think it is.
-This is the speed?

456
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:15,942
That's it.

457
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,143
That's the speed.

458
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,011
I'm being tapped.

459
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,348
That's it.

460
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,219
Right. Right. Right. Right.

461
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:29,855
Hey!

462
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,225
It's tapping. It's tapping.

463
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,629
-It's tapping.
-I'll use this mode. "Tap."

464
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,466
Now it's on "knead."

465
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,802
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

466
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:46,639
Okay.

467
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,774
-Next is "grab." A big grab.
-Okay.

468
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,376
-A strong grab?
-Right.

469
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,378
-I'll start at four.
-All of a sudden?

470
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,412
Five.

471
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:54,647
Six.

472
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,415
-Seven.
-It's grabbing.

473
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,017
-Eight.
-It's grabbing!

474
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,285
-Nine.
-It's grabbing!

475
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,186
Ten.

476
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,153
Ten!

477
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,621
-It's grabbing!
-How is it?

478
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:03,556
It's grabbing!

479
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,857
-Ten.
-It's grabbing!

480
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,459
It grabbed. It's still grabbing.

481
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,426
-Ten.
-Ten.

482
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:08,828
Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten.

483
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,737
-It's grabbing.
-I already turned it off.

484
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,541
He's in real danger.

485
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,384
Nobody is there to laugh.

486
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:36,856
But that really is amazing.

487
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,159
-We have less than an hour.
-An hour.

488
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,395
I think it's time for Zombie Time.

489
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,231
Zombie Time!

490
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,499
Here they come!

491
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,769
Bring it on!

492
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:51,404
I'm scared.

493
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,711
I go in through here?

494
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,014
-Go to the booth at the end.
-Okay.

495
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,420
-Mister, do you want to shower first?
-Okay.

496
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,388
What's this?

497
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:11,390
-Put your wallet in here.
-Okay.

498
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,926
Put your wallet inside.
Take a shower. I'll wait.

499
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,595
-Okay. Thanks.
-Was it raining outside?

500
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,831
Outside? I think it's stopped now.

501
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,167
-So, it's not raining anymore?
-Right.

502
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,069
Okay. Take a shower.

503
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,837
-You're handsome.
-Thank you.

504
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,506
-Do you still have work?
-I'm finished for today.

505
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,674
Is your office nearby?

506
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,410
My office is nearby.
But my home is closer, actually.

507
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,579
Then you must come again. It feels good.

508
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,247
-Take a shower, mister.
-Okay.

509
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:39,552
Hang your clothes while you take a shower.
There's a hook.

510
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:40,553
Here.

511
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,625
Lily, Lulu, Yuyu.
All of our girls are cute.

512
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,962
All of the girls are really cute.

513
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,065
Lily, Lulu, Yuyu.

514
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,302
All of the girls are so cute.

515
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,438
-Can you use the shower?
-Yes.

516
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,940
Can I come out now?

517
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:03,742
-Yes. Okay. Come on out.
-Okay.

518
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,177
-Thank you.
-Sure.

519
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:06,612
Is it cold?

520
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,280
It's a bit cold.

521
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,050
Go into that booth. Okay.

522
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,221
-It's not your first time, is it?
-It's my first time here.

523
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,355
-I see.
-Right.

524
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:21,427
What time do you usually come?
It must be late. After work?

525
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:22,495
That's right.

526
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,765
-Who were you with last time? Lily? Lulu?
-Lily.

527
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,901
-Lily, Lulu. All the girls are cute.
-Yes.

528
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,269
-Lay face down.
-Sure.

529
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,808
-Look at this big body.
-Thank you.

530
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,844
With a body this big, you must get stiff.

531
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,412
They always do that.

532
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,082
How is this? Where are you the most tired?

533
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,683
I guess it's my head.

534
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,252
-Your shoulders?
-Okay.

535
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,953
You're so stiff.

536
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,160
-I'll start the oil massage now.
-Thank you.

537
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,594
-Here we go.
-Thanks.

538
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,832
This feels the best.

539
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,867
-Stop squirming.
-Sorry.

540
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,736
You won't be popular with the girls.

541
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,506
Mister.

542
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,542
Mister...

543
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,911
You want a 30-minute extension.

544
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,245
Okay.

545
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,614
-A 30-minute extension.
-30 minutes? Okay.

546
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,250
This will feel good.
It's a special service.

547
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,186
-Then I'll have 30 minutes.
-Right?

548
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,387
Right?

549
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,990
Okay. On your back, mister.

550
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,158
-Sure.
-Okay.

551
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,164
-You're having a 30-minute extension.
-Okay.

552
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,833
This feels very good on your nipples.

553
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,101
Okay?

554
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,177
Mister, you don't need to move that much.

555
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:46,645
Sorry, I just...

556
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,261
-Now I will massage your lymph nodes.
-Okay.

557
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:03,996
-Ready?
-Thank you.

558
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,631
Okay. Here we go.

559
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:07,967
This will feel really good.

560
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:09,935
Your legs are so stiff!

561
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,871
-He's a complete idiot.
-Don't tell me you will fart.

562
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:14,640
Here we go.

563
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,479
-That feels good.
 -My stomach hurts.

564
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,147
Ow. Ow. Ow.

565
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,923
Mister, this will feel really good.

566
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,625
Good, good, good.

567
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,126
Good, good, good.

568
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,128
Guys...

569
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,631
But Kinoshita is doing amazingly well.

570
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,767
Is this allowed?

571
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,937
-Is it really okay?
 -They're really doing it.

572
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,340
-It feels good, right?
-Is it really okay?

573
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,978
-It's okay?
-It's a special to make you feel good.

574
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,880
-Good, good.
-It's okay?

575
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,651
The lymph nodes feel good, right?
We have to get it flowing.

576
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,986
Can they really survive this?

577
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,860
-Is that too strong?
-No. Thank you.

578
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,863
Do you want hot tea or cold tea
when we finish?

579
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:12,564
-Is it over?
-Why ask?

580
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:13,732
-What?
-Sorry?

581
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,967
Well...

582
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,502
Is this the end?

583
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,871
Special service...

584
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,176
-Okay. 30 minutes, please.
-It will feel best in another 30 minutes.

585
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,512
-I'll take another 30 minutes.
-Okay.

586
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,584
-Mister, is it your first time here?
-Sorry?

587
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,059
This is so embarrassing.

588
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,262
-Okay.
-This is embarrassing.

589
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,631
Is Yamamoto in trouble?

590
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:46,932
How is Yamamoto?

591
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:50,703
This is a good one.

592
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:52,805
Hey.

593
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,277
-Wait.
-Okay. All done.

594
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,979
-The feel good special is done.
-Is that all?

595
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,348
It's over, right?

596
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,083
Time up, right?

597
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,151
Or you can have another 30 minutes.

598
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,691
Then I'll take the "Double Dip Course."

599
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,227
The Double Dip Course feels the best.

600
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:21,900
Wait.

601
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,703
I'm going to blow.

602
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,473
Is that okay?

603
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,708
You do the last bit yourself.

604
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,844
-Do it yourself.
-Right.

605
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,613
If I do it,
I get in trouble with the owner.

606
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,547
Sorry.

607
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,116
-You do it yourself.
-Okay.

608
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,584
Okay?

609
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,719
-Do it yourself.
-In the shower?

610
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,554
Do it yourself in the shower. Okay?

611
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,524
-My stomach hurts. Ow. Ow. Ow.
-Don't forget this.

612
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,094
-Thank you.
-That was intense.

613
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,464
-It felt good, right?
-Yes. Thank you.

614
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,634
-Come again. Your office is nearby.
-Okay.

615
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,306
-Mister, do you want your tea hot or cold?
-I'll have it hot, thanks.

616
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:05,043
That was crazy. Well done for holding on.

617
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,914
Did you come together?

618
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,216
-You mean us?
-Yes.

619
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,418
No.

620
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,387
Who do you want? Have you chosen a girl?

621
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:16,688
No.

622
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,657
We aren't here for that.

623
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,626
All of our girls are so cute.

624
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,561
Lily. Lulu. Yuyu.

625
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,531
They are all so cute.

626
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,666
They all come from Dalian City.

627
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,569
Everyone from Dalian is cute, right?

628
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,672
-What's your name?
 -That's a nasty sweat.

629
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,107
My name is Yuyu.

630
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:36,942
Yuyu.

631
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,044
Have you been here long?

632
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,947
Of course I have.
I've been working here for ages.

633
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:42,948
I mean...

634
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:46,318
Mister, is the shower warm enough?
Are you okay?

635
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,354
Mister?

636
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,524
Don't worry. I'll be waiting outside.

637
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,227
He's taking a shower.

638
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,004
This guy is so annoying.

639
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,328
Both sides were amazing.
That went on for so long.

640
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:30,562
I am so tired.

641
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:34,666
-Wasn't that amazing?
-That should be against the rules.

642
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,369
I'm exhausted.

643
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,972
-That wasn't fair.
-I really am exhausted.

644
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,940
Right, Kinoshita? I understand.

645
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,910
-That was exhausting.
-I'm completely drained.

646
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,945
-We can hear the shower.
-Yeah, you can.

647
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,982
It's funny to hear someone
really taking a shower.

648
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,955
-That was too much.
-It sure was. That was wrong.

649
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,258
-That wasn't fair.
-That really was too much.

650
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,293
-He was touching him.
-He really was.

651
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:05,764
-Kobayashi was enjoying it, too.
-Seriously, what are you guys doing?

652
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:06,732
Damn.

653
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,500
Kinoshita, orange card!

654
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,404
You guys truly are insane.

655
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,239
-So, Kinoshita.
-Yes?

656
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,943
Let's look at the moment
that you actually laughed.

657
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,183
He held it in so much, he was sweating.

658
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:35,761
What the hell is that song?

659
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,300
That was impossible.

660
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,436
That really was funny.

661
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,138
But he really...

662
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,575
-He really played with my dick.
-He was doing it for real.

663
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,145
When you reach the utmost limits
of holding in a laugh,

664
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,179
you actually sweat.

665
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,615
-Yes, I was sweating.
 -That was amazing.

666
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,717
I mean, it was like...

667
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,920
It became difficult to breathe.
I couldn't breathe properly.

668
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,590
-And about that low-frequency device duel.
-Yes?

669
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,793
Every time you attacked him
with zaps from that device,

670
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,462
you were the one who was under attack.

671
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,032
You were confusing offense with defense.

672
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,534
-Right?
-Yes.

673
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,468
He's right.

674
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:20,205
And only an audience can laugh at that
"I already turned it off" joke.

675
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:23,075
Seriously.
That wasn't laughable from the start.

676
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:26,211
It was like,
"Who is he even doing this for?"

677
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,347
But this is more exciting.

678
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,315
-They're square.
-Same color cards.

679
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:31,783
-You two can go.
-Okay.

680
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:35,220
The zombies that came once
can't come back, right?

681
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,824
-I don't know about that.
-It wouldn't be the same.

682
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,759
-Same zombie, same trick.
-Well, yeah.

683
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:43,996
-I'm not sure. I can't say yet.
-Same zombie, same trick, right?

684
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:45,597
-That was tough.
-Bye.

685
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,202
I can't take this.

686
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,838
That went on for so long.

687
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,339
-Great work.
-Thank you.

688
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,174
-That was amazing.
-That was funny.

689
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,743
-It sure was.
-Wow.

690
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,345
This will go down in history.

691
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,446
It was superb.

692
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,581
Okay.

693
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,650
Here we go.

694
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,819
-That was the wrong place to sit.
-We're on!

695
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:11,323
COMING UP NEXT

696
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,393
THE SEASON THREE FINALE

697
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,135
Zombie Time!

698
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,436
They're back already?

699
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,314
Well, that was insane.

700
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,118
Those zombies. They were just...

701
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,486
That was impossible.
