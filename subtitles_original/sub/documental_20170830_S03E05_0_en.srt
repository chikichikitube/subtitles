00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:22,590
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,162
FIVE HOURS AND 15 MINUTES
HAVE PASSED

4
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,932
EIGHT MEN ARE OUT

5
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,269
I am so disappointed.

6
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:39,373
I guess I lost my concentration.

7
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,412
UNEXPLODED BOMBS

8
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,214
If someone wins this competition,

9
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,850
I won't get my million yen back.

10
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:54,422
I only got to do one-third...
Only one-quarter of what I prepared.

11
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,358
There were so many more things
that I wanted to try.

12
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,194
You wouldn't believe how much more
I had left to do.

13
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,197
My bag is totally packed
with outfits and stuff today.

14
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,800
I still had a lot of tricks in my bag.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,003
It feels like I didn't give it
everything I could have.

16
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,304
This is so frustrating.

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,110
THE REVENGE OF THE ZOMBIES

18
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,286
Kinoshita, orange card!

19
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,591
Your brain starts going crazy.

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,161
They didn't laugh at the things
they usually laugh at.

21
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,565
That space really drives you crazy.

22
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,267
It's pure chaos in there.

23
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,369
That was one million yen!

24
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,105
Of course, I'm sad about the million yen,

25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,174
but on top of that,

26
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,278
I wanted to see the view in that room
a few hours from now.

27
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:57,885
THE VIEW IN THAT ROOM
A FEW HOURS LATER

28
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,867
So far in this show,

29
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,303
I've never guessed the winner correctly.

30
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,506
My prediction has never come true.

31
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,175
Nobody can tell what's going to happen.

32
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,744
That's one of the things about  Documental.

33
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,415
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO
Presents Documental

34
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,290
Okay.

35
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,359
Here we go.

36
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,362
-That was the wrong place to sit.
-We're on!

37
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,010
-What the hell?
  -Let's do this.

38
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,132
It's a totally unremarkable
  staring contest.

39
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,104
That's what kids do.

40
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,538
I can't believe this.

41
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,243
Really?

42
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,978
Is this where we end up?

43
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,263
Wow. This is amazing.

44
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,432
It's amazing!

45
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,139
Wow. It's just like being there.

46
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,277
This really is some view.

47
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,013
Seriously? Is this real?

48
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,815
Huh?

49
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,052
Wow! This is amazing.

50
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,121
It's like he really is there
in front of my eyes.

51
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,558
This is amazing.

52
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,331
Amazing.

53
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,868
This really is...

54
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:37,805
Ouch.

55
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,640
Wow. Okay, I see.

56
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,776
This part doesn't exist. It's not real.
This is amazing.

57
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,248
Amazing.

58
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,751
It really is amazing.

59
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,692
Amazing.

60
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,527
It's like he's really here.

61
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,332
Did you buy that?

62
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,967
Yes, I did.

63
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,909
Do you think the next Zombie Time
  will have the curry rice dick thing?

64
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,880
That combined with the "Now and Then" guy?

65
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,317
That would be tough.

66
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,754
That room is funny.

67
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,922
That is funny.

68
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,594
-I have really light sneakers.
  -That looks good, Kukky.

69
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,895
You changed your mind?

70
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,133
You've changed your mind?

71
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,773
You're both going there?

72
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,049
I see.

73
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,890
He doesn't have an audience.

74
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,094
I don't know why he bothered to come out.

75
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,263
He'll just end up waiting around.

76
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,131
What is he holding?

77
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,234
This guy's an idiot, too.

78
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,737
What are you doing, Yamamoto?

79
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,277
He keeps dressing up, then undressing.
  Over and over again.

80
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,279
Zombie Time is coming.

81
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,713
It's coming!

82
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,219
Even if you go out like that,

83
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,621
there is no way that Kinoshita will laugh.

84
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,056
Not at this stage.

85
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,359
Who would laugh at that?
  Seriously, Yamamoto.

86
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,495
Just hurry up and go.

87
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,497
Okay?

88
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,767
Just do it.

89
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,807
Kinoshita doesn't know what to do.

90
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,749
Hurry up, Yamamoto.

91
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,418
Enough with that.

92
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,820
Your husband is waiting for you.

93
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,158
Your husband is waiting.

94
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,893
He's taking forever.

95
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,261
He really is.

96
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,963
Come on, Yamamoto.

97
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,766
Nobody will laugh at that outfit now.

98
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,141
Yamamoto.

99
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,509
Hurry up already.

100
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,878
All right.

101
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,913
No way.

102
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,883
That's not even close.

103
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,064
I missed you so much.

104
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,367
Me too.

105
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,974
Let's dance.

106
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,915
They're playing for an audience.

107
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,955
That is foul.

108
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,891
We've gone far enough.

109
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,761
You always say that.

110
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,799
Who are you doing this for?

111
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,385
We can't, Kinoshita!

112
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,557
I'll call them.

113
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,826
We mustn't, Kinoshita!

114
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,929
Zombie Time!

115
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,865
I think I need to sit down.

116
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,534
Can I sit here?

117
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,389
-Good work.
-Thanks.

118
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,523
Good work.

119
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,125
So,

120
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,793
once again,

121
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,998
I've given myself the power to emit
a new object.

122
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,067
-Will you please watch?
-Okay.

123
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,670
Thank you.

124
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,440
I'd like you to watch
in the arena seating area.

125
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,176
-Arena seats?
-Way to go.

126
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,711
He always delivers.

127
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:45,846
Please come here.

128
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,547
Thank you.

129
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,719
I hope they can withstand this.

130
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,625
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

131
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,263
White wine?

132
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,432
WHITE WINE

133
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,800
Is that the title?

134
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,836
-Is the title "White Wine"?
-Sorry. That's irrelevant.

135
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,740
Sorry.

136
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,582
Yamamoto is in trouble.

137
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,286
Kinoshita might be in trouble too.
  What does that "White Wine" mean?

138
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,055
Here I go.

139
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,857
What is it?

140
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,472
That is the worst trick ever.

141
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,540
Thank you.

142
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,608
It was "Noodles with Tempura."

143
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,547
That really is the worst.

144
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,915
Excuse me.

145
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,185
-Is there still more?
-Yes.

146
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,456
-Remove that "White Wine."
-Oh, sorry.

147
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,623
Good point.

148
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,229
What does that "White Wine" mean?

149
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,365
-I'm ready for my next trick.
-Okay.

150
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,435
We've had enough. Is this the last one?

151
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,170
It's my last trick.

152
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,074
Okay.

153
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,745
Here I go.

154
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,115
Excuse me.

155
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,320
It's coming out the side.

156
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,755
What the hell is this?

157
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,632
What is it?

158
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:51,938
What is that?

159
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,840
A paddle?

160
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,444
Voila!

161
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,788
They survived.

162
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,093
-How could they not laugh at that?
-That was really funny.

163
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:16,563
Thank you.

164
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,665
Is that all?

165
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,833
Yes.

166
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,335
Okay.

167
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,810
Excuse me.

168
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,551
What an amazing effort.

169
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,624
I am exhausted.

170
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,393
That is exhausting.

171
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,030
How much longer will this Zombie Time
go on for?

172
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,033
There are still a few to come, right?

173
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,868
Those zombies.

174
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,906
I'll try to settle down.

175
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,948
Now that Yamamoto has stepped out
  we have to wait until calling in a zombie.

176
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,956
As far as points go,

177
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,624
Yamamoto is in the lead, right?

178
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,367
What are you sucking on?

179
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,868
Those pills from before.

180
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,311
Akiyama, red card!

181
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,449
Here we go.

182
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,518
ATTACK POINTS:
YAMAMOTO = 1, KINOSHITA = 0

183
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,387
Zombie Time.

184
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,357
Only 20 minutes left.

185
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,159
I can do this.

186
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,698
Just a bit more. Just a bit more.

187
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,468
-What's this?
-It's only 20 minutes.

188
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,574
Is this yours?

189
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,643
No, that's not mine.

190
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,012
-It's not?
-It's not mine.

191
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,216
Does this belong to Yamamoto?

192
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,851
No, that isn't mine.

193
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,286
Whose is it?

194
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,353
Oh!

195
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,274
No way.

196
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,876
No way.

197
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,110
Did you do this?

198
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,379
-Did you put this inside?
-Not me.

199
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:49,883
What?

200
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,487
It smells like mustard.

201
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,723
-Mustard?
-I'm not sure. Mustard...

202
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,391
This stinks.

203
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,528
-Whose is this?
-I don't know. I just put my hand in.

204
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,196
What a mess.

205
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,806
So, here we go.

206
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,145
Zombie Time!

207
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,155
-We've reached the climax.
-This is it.

208
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,230
No way.

209
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,034
Yes?

210
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,903
Hello.

211
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,140
I am Terence Lee.

212
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,110
-Oh, you were here before.
-Hi.

213
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,484
Welcome to "Now and Then."

214
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,053
-That's for me.
-Okay.

215
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,088
-There you go.
-Thank you.

216
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:03,723
Thanks.

217
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,599
Here's your rice.

218
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,335
Didn't you order rice?

219
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,103
-I'm going to eat.
-Bon appétit.

220
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,540
This is your hayashi rice.

221
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,685
It's fried rice.

222
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,421
There he is.

223
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,557
Teddy Bear.

224
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:38,725
Stop it.

225
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,727
You can't eat it. It's not yours.

226
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,263
-What's wrong, Teddy?
-Don't eat it.

227
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,432
I'm hungry.

228
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,467
-Huh?
-Teddy.

229
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,836
-Teddy, stop it.
-Huh?

230
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,038
-What is this?
-Do you want some?

231
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,308
-Do you want to eat?
-Teddy.

232
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,743
I want to eat.

233
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,645
-Teddy.
-You want to eat?

234
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,513
You want some, too?

235
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,482
I'm hot.

236
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,951
-Take off your sweater.
-Teddy.

237
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,454
-That's the reason you're hot.
-Stop it, Teddy.

238
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,661
What is this?

239
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,297
-Teddy, stop it.
-Look how small it is.

240
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,765
Your sweater was that small?

241
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,768
You wore a sweater that tiny?

242
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,637
When I took this sweater off,

243
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,506
it was tiny.

244
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,107
You wore a sweater that tiny?

245
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,143
-Amazing, right?
-Yes. It is amazing.

246
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,445
It shrinks this much.

247
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:33,780
This sweater.

248
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,349
Are you hungry? You are hungry.

249
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,450
Want some?

250
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,185
You'll have some, too?

251
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,954
-Then you should eat.
-Okay.

252
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,856
-Eat up.
-Go for it.

253
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,290
-Eat this.
-Yeah.

254
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:45,992
Eat up.

255
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,862
-Did you want some?
-Yeah.

256
00:18:58,838 --> 00:18:59,939
Isn't she cute?

257
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,243
-She's cute, right?
  -What was that?

258
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,912
That is one disturbing sight.

259
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,448
-Try feeding her.
-I'm good, thanks.

260
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,350
-Feed her, please.
-No.

261
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,685
-That is scary.
-Let Yamamoto do it.

262
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,254
Try feeding her.

263
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,756
-Feed her.
-Feed her, please.

264
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,958
-Feed her.
-Just feed her.

265
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,695
-Teddy won't eat unless you feed her.
-She won't eat otherwise.

266
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,664
Please feed Teddy.

267
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,000
She won't feed herself.

268
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,536
Look. The poor girl can't do it herself.

269
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,905
He's the one who said he was hungry.

270
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,007
They'll feed you.

271
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,308
Hey. Hey!

272
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,710
You two guys. Please feed her.

273
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,779
Old lady, feed me.

274
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,014
Come on.

275
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,083
Gray-haired old lady, please feed me.

276
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,685
Sir, ma'am, please.

277
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,153
Sir.

278
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,855
Please feed me.

279
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,091
-I want it in my mouth.
-Sir. Ma'am.

280
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,428
Don't touch me.

281
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,497
Don't touch her.

282
00:19:58,898 --> 00:19:59,999
You can't touch Teddy.

283
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,201
You need to do it better. Do it better.

284
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,470
-Come on.
-Sir, come here.

285
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,140
She can't eat on her own.

286
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,183
-That was scary.
-Ma'am, come here.

287
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,918
Scary. Scary. Scary.

288
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,253
-Damn.
-Come here.

289
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,091
-She already had some.
-That's not enough. Come on.

290
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,094
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Give some to Teddy.

291
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,896
-Come with me.
-Feed Teddy.

292
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,298
Look at her! Look at how hungry she is.

293
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,533
She can't feed herself.

294
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,667
See?

295
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,803
Look at her. Look her in the eyes.

296
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,771
Watch out. She'll bite you.

297
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,340
Don't touch Teddy.

298
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,742
Don't touch me.

299
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,378
-Don't touch her.
-Look at her.

300
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,447
I am Teddy Bear.

301
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,716
Don't touch me.

302
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,385
-Please.
-Pass the fork.

303
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:53,987
Give the man the fork.

304
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,489
I'm all hot.

305
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,491
I'm so hot now.

306
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,195
Where are you going?

307
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,763
You didn't feed her.

308
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
You didn't feed her.

309
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,902
Twirl the fork around.

310
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,172
That's right. Like that. But look at her!

311
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,941
Look or you'll stab her.

312
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,542
You need to look.

313
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,379
You have to look.

314
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,149
-Look at her properly. Look.
-Feed her.

315
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,884
-Look.
-Feed the bear.

316
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:25,852
Look.

317
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,487
-Can you see her?
-See?

318
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:29,856
Open wide.

319
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,724
Open up.

320
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,463
How is Kinoshita?

321
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,299
That wasn't enough. She wants more.

322
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,872
-That wasn't enough.
-It's not enough. Look.

323
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,107
-She needs more.
-What about hayashi rice?

324
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,475
-Can she eat it?
-She can.

325
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,743
-Sounds good.
-What?

326
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,644
Sounds good.

327
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,480
-Feed her some hayashi rice.
-Let's eat that too, Teddy.

328
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:55,782
Sir, please feed her.

329
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,684
-You like hayashi rice.
-Feed her.

330
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,751
You like this.

331
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,454
You need to look.
It's dangerous if you don't.

332
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:02,422
Come here.

333
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,691
He'll feed you too. You will, right?

334
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,660
Eat up or you'll die.

335
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:12,632
Good. Good.

336
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,133
There you go. She'll eat it.

337
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,206
That looks delicious.

338
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,908
It's yummy, right?

339
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,342
So, Ma'am.

340
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,811
Sir.

341
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,313
Ma'am. Feed her.

342
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,418
Look, ma'am. Look how hungry she is.

343
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,755
Do you see that piece stuck to her teeth?

344
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,124
Remove it for her. It's on her teeth.

345
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,992
It's stuck to her teeth.

346
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,260
It's stuck on her teeth.

347
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,129
Remove it from her teeth.

348
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,231
-Gray-haired old lady.
-Her teeth are...

349
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,000
-Clean my teeth gunk.
-She has gunk on her teeth.

350
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,702
Clean the gunk off Teddy's teeth.

351
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,104
-Old lady.
-Please.

352
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,272
-Gray-haired old lady.
-Please.

353
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,173
With my hand?

354
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,008
Clean Teddy's teeth gunk.

355
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,810
-With my hand?
-With your hand.

356
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:58,978
Please, clean it.

357
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,546
-With my hand?
-With your hand.

358
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,051
-You can use chopsticks.
-Here.

359
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,819
-You can use these.
-Clean her up.

360
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,055
There's a lot of gunk there.

361
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,556
I'll try from behind her.

362
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,226
-That's dangerous.
-It's okay. She'll turn over.

363
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:15,695
Okay.

364
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,432
It may be hard to reach from there.

365
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,300
This side might be better.

366
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,536
It's easy now.

367
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,006
-Together.
-Clean the gunk from her teeth.

368
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,978
Hurry up.

369
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,414
Be careful.
Look properly, or you'll poke her.

370
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,752
Be careful. She bites.

371
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,523
-She likes that.
-It feels good.

372
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,057
Doesn't that feel nice?

373
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:46,192
It's feels so good.

374
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,466
-These teeth too.
-These teeth too.

375
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,834
-These teeth too.
-These teeth too.

376
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,171
-Gray-haired old lady, do these teeth too.
-Clean that set too.

377
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,072
-These teeth too.
-Please clean them.

378
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,674
-These teeth too.
-Please.

379
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,743
-These are her real teeth.
-Right.

380
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,246
-Lastly, please feed her this salad.
-Salad?

381
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,881
-This salad.
-It's her favorite.

382
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,216
Give her some salad.

383
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,351
She loves the salad from "Now and Then."

384
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,854
Chopsticks are dangerous. Use your hands.

385
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,422
-By hand?
-That's better.

386
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,124
-Hurry, or she'll die.
-Hurry up.

387
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:21,027
She'll die if she doesn't eat
her vegetables. Hurry up.

388
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,395
Hold it for her.

389
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,931
Hold it near her mouth.

390
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,868
-How cute!
-She's so cute.

391
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,136
She sure is cute.

392
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,905
-What's wrong?
-Give me a piggyback.

393
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,040
What?

394
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,341
A piggyback.

395
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,576
She wants a piggyback.

396
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,878
-She ate too much.
-She needs a piggyback.

397
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,848
-Give her a piggyback.
-She can't walk.

398
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,717
-Sir, ma'am. Come over here.
-We can't do it ourselves.

399
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,052
-Piggyback?
-Piggyback.

400
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,553
Please give her a piggyback.

401
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,056
Gray-haired old lady.
Give her a piggyback.

402
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,524
Please give her one.

403
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,926
-Please do it.
-Just come over here.

404
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,795
-A piggyback?
-A piggyback.

405
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,365
-Give her a piggyback.
-Or a face-to-face bear hug.

406
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,902
Which would you prefer?

407
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,904
-Bear hug,
-It's a bear hug.

408
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:05,972
A bear hug.

409
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,740
-She wants a bear hug.
-Please.

410
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,877
Watch out! Hurry up!

411
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,512
-She can't move far by herself.
-Hurry up. Please.

412
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,682
-Get a little closer.
-Please wait.

413
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,851
Wait a minute.

414
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,624
-Come here old lady.
-Teddy will get injured. She'll collapse.

415
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,993
Look at how weirdly her arm is bent.

416
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,161
-It's going to break.
-It will break.

417
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,764
-Yes. That's better.
-Hurry up.

418
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,400
Hold her properly.

419
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,503
Yes. Yes. Like that.

420
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,006
-Look at her face.
-Look at her properly.

421
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,207
Look at her face.

422
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,409
Come on. Stand up.

423
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:45,745
When she stands up, look at her face.

424
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,046
Look at her face. See?

425
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,181
Look at her face.

426
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,952
Watch out for her teeth.
They'll stab into you.

427
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,120
Be careful.

428
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,323
-She smells like salad.
-What?

429
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,692
-She smells like salad.
-Because she ate some.

430
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:00,760
Salad, right?

431
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,262
-Okay. Ma'am.
-Sir.

432
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:04,797
It's your turn.

433
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,067
I know.

434
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,736
That hug feels nice. I know.

435
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,004
Excuse me, Ma'am?

436
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,807
He didn't have the right build.

437
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,311
Sorry.

438
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,914
-Look at her.
-You don't have to hug.

439
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,250
Just take a good look, right at her face.

440
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,687
There, there. Good.

441
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,426
-Does that feel good?
-Does it feel good, Teddy?

442
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,894
Does the old lady feel good?

443
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,266
-Does it feel good?
-Yes, it does.

444
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,001
It feels good?

445
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,704
Look at her.
This is her "it feels good" face.

446
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,340
Look at how she looks when she feels good.

447
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,476
That feels so good.

448
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:51,877
Look at her.

449
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,112
You're not looking.

450
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,448
She feels good.

451
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,218
-Does it feel good?
-Look at her.

452
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,123
-Can both of you hug her?
-Hug her together.

453
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,225
-Both of us?
-That's right. Together.

454
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,660
When will this end?

455
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,729
-Let's go over there.
-Does it feel good?

456
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,431
-It feels good.
-It does? It feels good, Teddy?

457
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,138
Kinoshita.

458
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,306
Kinoshita.

459
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,841
Isn't this too long?

460
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:25,044
Hasn't the Teddy Bear bit
gone on for too long?

461
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,716
Kinoshita.

462
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,451
Kinoshita.

463
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,888
Isn't this Teddy Bear bit way too long?

464
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,690
-Too long?
-Too long?

465
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,059
The Teddy Bear bit?

466
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,861
It is long for one bit.

467
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,499
-Why don't we go back inside for a while?
-Let's go.

468
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:47,666
Let's go back.

469
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,036
-We don't want to be too long.
-Let's go back.

470
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,273
Back to "Now and Then."

471
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,309
That bit was too long, wasn't it?

472
00:27:58,577 --> 00:27:59,545
Right?

473
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,580
Yeah, it was a little bit too long.

474
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,883
-It's all too long.
-Let's go.

475
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,951
-All of this is too long?
-All of it.

476
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,357
They survived.

477
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:12,792
Thank you.

478
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,461
Thank goodness.

479
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:17,897
I'm exhausted.

480
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,566
I am so exhausted.

481
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,701
That wasn't even a teddy bear.

482
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,972
That went on for so long.

483
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,310
Yamamoto.

484
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,514
You were the first one
to get a yellow card, right?

485
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,183
Yellow and orange.

486
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,618
-You were the first?
-I got the first yellow.

487
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:41,787
Before anyone else.

488
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,123
Isn't that amazing?

489
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,827
-There were some close calls.
-There sure were.

490
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,195
Which came close?

491
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,097
That bit just now was close.

492
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,199
Kasuga's paddle, too.

493
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:56,635
His table tennis penis.

494
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,906
That's right.

495
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,042
-Kobayashi came close, too.
-Yes?

496
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,612
-The way he enjoyed his massage.
-Yes, that came close.

497
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,647
He wasn't faking it.

498
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,216
Kobayashi...

499
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:32,838
Here we go.

500
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,641
Zombie Time!

501
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:36,876
They're back already?

502
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,111
I need to survive this.

503
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,282
They stay for so long.

504
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,665
They're barely alive.

505
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,549
This is bad.

506
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,831
Is Yamamoto in trouble?

507
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,971
It's so funny, it hurts.

508
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,407
This hurts.

509
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,919
They'll suffocate.

510
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:19,571
Okay.

511
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:21,940
It's looking good.

512
00:32:58,444 --> 00:32:59,712
Absolutely amazing.

513
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,531
Wow!

514
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,333
This is amazing.

515
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,869
That is the end!

516
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,605
That was amazing!

517
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,340
Wow.

518
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,114
-I am exhausted.
-That was exhausting.

519
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,382
I'm spent.

520
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:47,352
-In the end, two participants survived.
-I'm so tired.

521
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,387
Yes.

522
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:51,123
Both Yamamoto and Kinoshita survived.

523
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,326
-We turn to the points.
-Oh, that's right.

524
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,931
The one with the most attack points wins,
which means...

525
00:34:58,997 --> 00:34:59,932
Yes?

526
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,534
-The winner is...
-Yes.

527
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,004
Yamamoto!

528
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,808
-Me?
-That's right.

529
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,378
That's right!

530
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,349
It was the bit that Yamamoto did
with the pills that scored a point.

531
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,485
-The pills.
-That's what it came down to.

532
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,019
-Really?
-Yes.

533
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,523
Damn.

534
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,558
It's not coming back.

535
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,126
-For real?
-He got us.

536
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,396
The first person to get a card
was actually Yamamoto.

537
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,499
-Yes.
-It was Yamamoto.

538
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,135
But in the end, it was Yamamoto who won.

539
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:38,804
On points.

540
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,073
-Good for you!
-That was amazing.

541
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,341
He defeated us.

542
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,643
Can I really take this?

543
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,078
Wow!

544
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,581
-Wow!
-That's amazing!

545
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,618
That finale truly was amazing.

546
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,419
How could you survive that?

547
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,156
Simply because I wanted it.
I really wanted that 10 million yen.

548
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,360
I only had to hold out
a little bit longer.

549
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,097
-Kasuga's last "Toos" nearly got me.
-That was really dangerous.

550
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,766
-Hats off to you for coming up with that.
-Yeah...

551
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,035
-You are amazing.
-But it wasn't enough.

552
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:12,037
-In conclusion...
-It can't be helped.

553
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:15,507
Documental Season 3 comes to an end
with Yamamoto as the champion!

554
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:18,877
Congratulations.

555
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,312
Great job!

556
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,019
I'm sorry.
I don't know why, but I'm just sorry.

557
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,055
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,091
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

559
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:40,632
Thank you.

560
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:43,402
I was really close, but of course,

561
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,138
I needed to score more points
along the way.

562
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,441
It's extremely exhausting.

563
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,278
Holding back laughter is exhausting.

564
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:58,383
If it was for 100,000 yen,
I would have laughed in no time.

565
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,420
Thank you.

566
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:02,921
Really, thank you.

567
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:04,957
To everyone involved in this,

568
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,526
let me buy you a drink.

569
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,928
What about your partner Kato?

570
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,098
You're right, Kato. Well, to be honest...

571
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,534
If Kato was here,

572
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:19,237
he would tell me to pay for that jet
he chartered on  Mecha-Ike.

573
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,341
He really did pay four million yen
for that himself.

574
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,478
Maybe I'll give him two million...

575
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:28,647
Maybe not.

576
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,483
He earns two million in just
a few episodes of  Sukkiri!!

577
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,419
Can't we keep this a secret?

578
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,154
Just until he sees this himself.

579
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,391
He'll say, "You got that much money?"
Just until then, please.

580
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,960
Is this really okay, Mr. Soundman?

581
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,462
Mr. Cameraman, really?

582
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,400
Well, this season played out
completely differently again.

583
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,402
-Did you want some?
-Yeah.

584
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,279
As for Zombie Time, I think we can say

585
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,081
it was right on the money.

586
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:06,351
I think it went extremely well.

587
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:09,354
It offered a different perspective
on this competition.

588
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,624
It made the humor more three-dimensional.

589
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,193
Wait.

590
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:17,963
I'm going to blow.

591
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,632
Is that okay?

592
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,167
And Kinoshita...

593
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:26,271
He tried so hard not to laugh,
he ended up dripping with sweat.

594
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,706
I'd never seen that before.

595
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,676
It turns out that holding back laughter
can make you sweat.

596
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,177
That was a bit of a surprise.

597
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:33,679
And Akiyama and Kobayashi.

598
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,815
Those zombies. They were just...

599
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,050
That was impossible.

600
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,951
If I had been in that room,

601
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:44,222
I would have spent two or three months'
worth of laughter right then and there.
