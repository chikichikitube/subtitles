MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME VIEWERS.

00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:22,490
PLEASE ENJOY THE SHOW
AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,627
What's the most difficult thing for
the players in Documental?

4
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,864
Well, you see...

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,632
You get lost.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,939
It's not like you're playing in a theater,
where you have a live audience before you.

7
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,574
There's no laughter.

8
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,979
When you have the audience's laughter
taken away from you,

9
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,516
it's like having the light switched off
in your lighthouse.

10
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,351
Kawashima, that's no good.

11
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,021
-It's no good.
-Yeah.

12
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:57,725
You start wondering,
"Exactly where am I swimming to?"

13
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:01,729
So I'm sure there are moments
when they feel quite insecure.

14
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,498
But the opposite happens, too.
Even if nobody laughs,

15
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,436
sometimes you're sure something is funny.
And you keep pushing it.

16
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,072
Then you watch it later,
and realize it wasn't funny at all.

17
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,407
It's me.

18
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,976
I'm Master Hamburg!

19
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,213
Now, I'll offer you hungry folks...

20
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:25,079
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO
Presents Documental

21
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,350
Pengin Shokudo? Who ur that?

22
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,118
Pengin Shokudo.

23
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,387
Remember "throwable dumplings"?

24
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,063
-It's the whole family.
-Wow.

25
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,865
Young actors pose like,

26
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,800
"What's going on, dude?"

27
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:48,969
During a shoot?

28
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,137
Fujimoto did that?

29
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,405
Why would I?

30
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,541
Did I?

31
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:54,975
Who was it?

32
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,177
-What's wrong?
-Ouch.

33
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,612
Wait a minute!

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,381
Why hide it like that?

35
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,016
What a big load.

36
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,653
Hang on. Isn't Kurosawa laughing?

37
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,056
Oh, honey! How could you?

38
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,491
You're so drunk!

39
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,494
-You can't sleep here.
-Ahh, I'm so drunk!

40
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,496
Orange?

41
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,036
Nipple beams. They point outwards. Heart.

42
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,106
Ah, Straddle Time!

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,509
Ah, ah, Straddle Time!

44
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,945
Straddle Time!

45
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,580
Yellow, I guess.

46
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,581
Yeah, yellow.

47
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,716
The new ones are...

48
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,789
Now you're on the ropes.

49
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,391
-You got orange. No more chances.
-Okay.

50
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,502
Won't this get you in trouble?

51
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,905
I don't know.
They haven't said anything yet.

52
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,809
It's probably just that Master Daisuke
doesn't know you've been dissing him.

53
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,811
-It must be a lot of work.
-Yeah.

54
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,013
-It took ages.
-You do it on your computer?

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,681
-Yes.
-Amazing.

56
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,018
I cut the parts out, alter them,
then I paste them back in.

57
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,020
It's shrunken here...

58
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,356
Then it grows.

59
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,828
Why is he doing a Kameda impression?

60
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,731
The close-ups are good.

61
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,133
I've got something along this line.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,336
-I bought some phone cases.
-Really? Phone cases?

63
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,572
-Show us.
-Tell me which you like.

64
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,643
-Hang on. Nishizawa's phone cases?
-I break them all the time.

65
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,678
-I'm scared.
-Me, too.

66
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,347
For example...

67
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,117
-We can see through the case.
-You spoiled it.

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,585
-Hm?
-Was that a smile?

69
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,487
No... Look...

70
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,355
The light made it...

71
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,362
-It's not a funeral portrait.
-It's Master Yoshio.

72
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,000
Who's that?

73
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,135
It's Obitani.

74
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,269
"The Pot."

75
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,139
Wow. You can buy these?

76
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,808
-Does Yoshimoto sell them?
-Well...

77
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,244
-They make Obitani's merchandise?
-Well...

78
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:11,945
These are amazing.

79
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,082
-Who'd buy Obitani's case?
-That's a super cool ducktail.

80
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,786
"Obitani Part II."

81
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,988
-From a different era?
-Is that Obitani?

82
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,624
-He looks laid back.
-He was in the lobby.

83
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,826
He looks like the Baystars' Daisuke Miura.

84
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,362
-There's a resemblance.
-The haircut.

85
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,631
They're from different eras.
See the glasses?

86
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,832
Yeah, different frames.

87
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,372
-"Master Osamu: The Simple Version."
-I like how his teeth are so small.

88
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,540
That's not the point.

89
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,543
And his ear cuff.

90
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,112
Master Sakata.

91
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,980
I can't choose between them.

92
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,217
Is this a termite seen through
a microscope?

93
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,020
It's Master Sakata.

94
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,622
-That's a bit rude.
-That was disrespectful.

95
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,926
Master Osamu has an elevator
in his house that's super slow.

96
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,362
-He has an elevator?
-In his single-family house?

97
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,432
-Have you been to his house?
-I've been.

98
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,401
-Have you seen the elevator?
-I have.

99
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,070
Isn't it amazing? It goes like this.

100
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,273
It's that slow?

101
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,477
-By the time you get to...
-Huh?

102
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,984
-That must have been Nishizawa.
-It's him, right?

103
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,488
-Why did he let out such a noise?
-He chuckled, just a bit.

104
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,290
He laughed the moment you started
going up slowly.

105
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,092
It's Nishizawa, right?

106
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,661
It was Nishizawa, but...

107
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,830
I couldn't see it very well myself.

108
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,798
Okay.

109
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,634
-Let's take a look and check.
-Okay.

110
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,203
-Have you been to his house?
-I've been.

111
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,405
-Have you seen the elevator?
-I have.

112
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,075
It's amazing, isn't it? It's like this.

113
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,646
You laughed.

114
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,582
That was the most natural one so far.

115
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,617
It was really...

116
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,918
-Yellow.
-Okay. Sorry.

117
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,419
It was such a natural laugh.

118
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,955
Sometimes I forget what's going on
for a moment.

119
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,358
-His elevator is so slow.
-It's that slow?

120
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,861
His wife walked up and down four times
before I got to the second floor.

121
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,464
-Four times?
-If I'd heard that I would've laughed.

122
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,866
That was close.
If I heard, I would've been out.

123
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,068
No, no, no! We're still safe now.

124
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,104
-What a waste.
-Nearly a red card.

125
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,506
I almost overlooked it. That was close.

126
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,208
-Let's resume.
-Okay.

127
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,443
-I'll go pee.
-This is tough.

128
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,279
-Do you want to pee first?
-Go ahead.

129
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,918
Let's go.

130
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,658
Nobody would buy these,
even if they were for sale.

131
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,060
-Obitani would be popular.
-No way.

132
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,430
-What if they were 300 yen?
-Not even if they were free.

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,299
I have gifts for everyone, too.

134
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,967
-Really?
-Gifts?

135
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,503
-What are they? Photos?
-May I?

136
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,904
Are they photos?

137
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,072
Photos?

138
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,307
-Can I open it?
-Sure.

139
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,508
Okay, we will.

140
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,576
Ready?

141
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,947
-It's his mother.
-His mother-in-law.

142
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,316
-His ex-mother-in-law, actually.
-That's right.

143
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,717
This I want to see.

144
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,988
-I'd like you all to look.
-He bought so many.

145
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:08,989
Why?

146
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,624
I want you to know.

147
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,192
-Know what?
-Huh?

148
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,794
-About your mother-in-law?
-Yes.

149
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,128
For real?

150
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,664
That is nasty.

151
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,366
-She's beautiful.
-She is.

152
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,667
Look here.

153
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,603
You don't often get to...

154
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,105
She's really showing the goods.

155
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,508
She's the one who gave birth to
that daughter...

156
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,644
She's beautiful.

157
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,180
She was about 60 at the time...

158
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,049
-She's over 60?
-Really?

159
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,923
I understand why she
wanted to publish this.

160
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,825
When you're this beautiful, yeah.

161
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,327
What was the target market?

162
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,896
It was a pretty big seller.

163
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,130
I'll bet.

164
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,164
No doubt.

165
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,067
-Nobu, this page is really good.
-I'm fine, thanks.

166
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:55,969
Here.

167
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,640
-I put a bookmark in there.
-It's okay. I have my own copy.

168
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,976
Ahh.

169
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,047
-The page you bookmarked?
-Yeah.

170
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,186
Start looking from that page.

171
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,556
Hey.

172
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,557
This is...

173
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,093
-Did you find a mysterious page?
-Mysterious page?

174
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,795
They're stuck together.

175
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,164
Oh, that's...

176
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,299
Look.

177
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,401
Yuck!

178
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,702
Please.

179
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,039
-He jerked off.
-He spanked the monkey!

180
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,273
To your mother-in-law?

181
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,909
-"Don't pity me. Fap for me."
-Classic quote.

182
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,545
It's stuck? Damn.

183
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,748
-Are they your favorite pages?
-You jerk off to that?

184
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,383
-What was her dog's name?
-Ryu.

185
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,451
Tissue.

186
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,225
Guys, I, um...

187
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,294
I got a tattoo.

188
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,630
-What were you thinking?
-How could you?

189
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,366
I think it's time comedians were
allowed to get one.

190
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,101
-You really think so?
-Bad move.

191
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,502
But I wanted one.

192
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,705
I just think it's time they were okay.

193
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,541
But you still have gigs
that require you to get naked.

194
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,309
-You are...
-I wanted one.

195
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,844
You'll be banned from pools.

196
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,879
-It's not on your back?
-Where is it?

197
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,047
There's nothing there.

198
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,088
-Very well drawn.
-Who gets their partner in ink?

199
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,456
What a bromance.

200
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,193
This is the face he makes after
he's said a joke, right?

201
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,761
After he's nailed one.

202
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,330
-That's when he says "It's me," right?
-No.

203
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,065
It's when he says "Hand, hand."

204
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,534
That's when his face looks the best.

205
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,439
-That's permanent.
-You okay?

206
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,209
Sorry, but I have a confession too.

207
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,277
I got a tattoo.

208
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,580
-Really?
-You, too?

209
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,782
-Hey, he's your partner.
-For real?

210
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,651
-But Nobu doesn't seem the type at all.
-Yeah.

211
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,653
That makes it more interesting.

212
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,323
-It's fire.
-Fire?

213
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,958
Flames?

214
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,359
Yes, flames.

215
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,660
I was thinking...

216
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,997
-I needed to challenge myself more.
-I see what you mean.

217
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,332
Fire?

218
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,267
It may help you focus.

219
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,538
I actually got them on my armpits.

220
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,009
-They're three dimensional.
-Wow.

221
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,879
-They look like birds.
-Black flames?

222
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,514
Black fire.

223
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,883
-Amazing.
-You don't say.

224
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,251
To be honest...

225
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,286
-Me, too.
-You got one?

226
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,989
I became the first in Asai Kikaku
to get a tattoo.

227
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,858
That wasn't a smart move, Iio.

228
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,561
I haven't shown it to anyone,
not even Sekine.

229
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,430
Will you be okay?

230
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,898
He doesn't like tattoos.

231
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,133
-Of course he doesn't.
-He'll hate it.

232
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,069
-Can you take a look?
-Seriously?

233
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,504
If you don't like it,
I'll get a skin graft.

234
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,707
-You'll remove it?
-But it's not like you.

235
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,110
It's not like me, or the agency.
However...

236
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,413
I needed to move forward, so I got two.

237
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,448
May I?

238
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,018
-Give me your honest opinions.
-Okay.

239
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,386
If you don't...

240
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,555
If you tell me to remove them, I will.

241
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,024
-May I?
-Sure.

242
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,659
-Really?
-Where are they?

243
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,262
I may be old,
but they're like pink sapphires.

244
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,033
That's a tough one.

245
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,270
-They're tattoos?
-They are not tattoos.

246
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,172
Did you add pink to them?

247
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,341
-You tattooed them pink?
-Pink pigment?

248
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,509
Amazing.

249
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,511
-Really.
-They're 48 years old.

250
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,279
-They truly are pink.
-Beautiful.

251
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,514
They're pink sapphires.

252
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,816
Do nipples represent the entire person?

253
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,919
Are they the same as a person's face?

254
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,656
I heard the diameter of your nipple
is the same as your pupil.

255
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:38,859
That's bull.

256
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,796
-That would be a nuisance.
-Right? You'd be all pupils.

257
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,464
They're too big for pupils.

258
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,033
You have the same nipples as Morio Kazama.

259
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,568
Ah, the color.

260
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,936
In Fall Guy?

261
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,538
Yeah, they're the same color.

262
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,673
What do you think?

263
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,445
You don't need a better look.
Everyone saw them.

264
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,046
Excuse me...

265
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,783
-If only you'd told me...
-Excuse me.

266
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,888
I've lost my wallet.

267
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,823
-Your wallet?
-Yes.

268
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,791
-Where?
-Around here.

269
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,361
-Your wallet?
-We haven't seen it.

270
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,463
You have an abnormal volume of hair.

271
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,698
-Are you a student?
-Yes.

272
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,000
My wallet...

273
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,169
-What a small forehead.
-Have you seen it?

274
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,436
We haven't.

275
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,705
I lost it somewhere around here.

276
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,874
-Shall we look for it?
-It's around here.

277
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,110
-What does it look like?
-Well...

278
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,745
It's a Puma wallet.

279
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,946
Puma?

280
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,614
-Are you in middle school?
-Yes.

281
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,949
Puma, with velcro.

282
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,118
-The ones you peel open?
-Right.

283
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,120
-The ones you rip.
-What color?

284
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,088
It's checkered.

285
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,558
I've never seen a checkered Puma wallet.

286
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,261
-Checkered Puma wallets are rare.
-You have an awful lot of hair.

287
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,499
-Your hair. There's an awful lot of it.
-But I had a haircut yesterday.

288
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,667
Yesterday?

289
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,135
It grew right back.

290
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,736
Just a little...

291
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,971
It's like a beehive.

292
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,440
-Are you on a school trip?
-I had a trim.

293
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,675
-On a school trip?
-No.

294
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,577
-You live nearby?
-Yes.

295
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,078
You have a small forehead.

296
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,713
Your wallet's not here.

297
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,949
-Why...
-My wallet's gone.

298
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,884
-We didn't take it.
-We didn't.

299
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,253
-We didn't do it.
-Are you suspecting us?

300
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,621
You should just go home.

301
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,189
I'll go then!

302
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,858
That's scary. You can't be like that.

303
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,361
-Go home. It's not here.
-I'm going!

304
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,033
Doesn't your mother say anything
about your hair?

305
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,002
What?

306
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,204
Doesn't your mom say anything
about your hair?

307
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,272
-She does.
-Right?

308
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,107
-She tell you to trim it?
-Yes.

309
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,977
Go get it trimmed.
Have it trimmed, then come back.

310
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,778
At least tell us your name.

311
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:40,780
Minoru Saji.

312
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,382
Saji?

313
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,585
-Your last name is Saji?
-Saji?

314
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,287
How do you write it?

315
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,957
You write the Kanji for "left"
and then "oneself."

316
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,092
I mean "temple."

317
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,226
How can you mistake it?

318
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,962
You must be lying.
To make a mistake like that.

319
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,564
-"Left temple."
-"Left temple."

320
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,666
You pronounce it "Saji," not "Hidaridera"?

321
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,601
-What was your first name?
-Minoru.

322
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:02,836
-Minoru?
-Yes.

323
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,604
You write that normally?

324
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,640
It's the kanji for "jitsu."

325
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,741
Jitsu?

326
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,576
-One letter?
-"Minoru."

327
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,177
-Then you add "noru."
-"Noru"?

328
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,612
In hiragana?

329
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,815
-"Noru" is in hiragana?
-Yes.

330
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:20,086
-Have you ever seen "noru" in hiragana?
-For Minoru? Never heard of that before.

331
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,521
We got it.

332
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,925
He has so much hair.

333
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,028
And a small forehead.

334
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,066
-Does he suspect us?
-He totally does.

335
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,168
-We didn't take it.
-We'd let you know.

336
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,236
Put on a belt.

337
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,639
-Minoru Saji.
-Minoru. Mi-noru.

338
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,712
Master Sakata was in the hospital
the other day.

339
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,746
Really?

340
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,949
He got a little sick,
and was in for just a while.

341
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,818
One day he called for a nurse.

342
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,287
But when she came to help he said,

343
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,057
"The lion inside the AC unit
keeps looking at me."

344
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,224
What the hell?

345
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,765
We can order a meal, right?

346
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:06,666
That's right.

347
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,376
-What kind of food do they have?
-Here's the menu.

348
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,045
-Order whatever you want!
-Huh?

349
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,313
Kariyushi.

350
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,582
Kariyushi? Is that my name now?

351
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,291
-Sorry, I was just trying to help.
-No problem at all.

352
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,292
Okay.

353
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,960
Maybe she can change in there.

354
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,630
-Kurosawa can change over there.
-Oh, I see. This area is hidden.

355
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,933
-Okay, that makes sense.
-Yeah.

356
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,869
Oh, I didn't need to bring this.

357
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,871
There's no camera here?

358
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,539
I see.

359
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,315
I guess I should do something.

360
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,455
-Come on!
-Is Fujimoto okay?

361
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,558
I'm getting hungry.

362
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,794
That's dry ice.

363
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,229
Please.

364
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,831
What?

365
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,767
That's dry ice.

366
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,140
That's not regular ice. It's dry ice.
It's coming out of your nose.

367
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,442
What an entertainer.

368
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,978
-So much coming out of your nose.
-He's got it wrong.

369
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,682
-Aren't you guys hungry?
-I am hungry, actually.

370
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,154
-It's been almost three hours.
-Hey! It'll stick to your mouth.

371
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,321
Spit it out.

372
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,057
It'll stick to the inside of your mouth.

373
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,126
-It's dry ice.
-Does it melt?

374
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,762
No, it sticks to your mouth!
That was dangerous!

375
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,797
I like it cold.

376
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,633
-That was way too cold.
-Normal ice isn't enough.

377
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,902
There was so much white smoke coming out.

378
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,439
Nishizawa, don't you have
anything to say about this?

379
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,008
I put it on, but...

380
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,844
Well, I noticed you had it on.

381
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,646
Don't you have anything to say?

382
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:00,914
Well...

383
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,482
I'm sorry.

384
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,851
-Is this safe?
-Don't let it stick.

385
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,953
-You'll be fine.
-You can't let it stick.

386
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,456
-Just keep rolling it.
-Keep rolling it?

387
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,890
-Otherwise it'll stick.
-Really.

388
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,926
-It will peel off your skin.
-Seriously?

389
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,561
Put some water in quickly.

390
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,331
-I'll put the water in first.
-Ah, but... You're right.

391
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,334
Well...

392
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:28,341
-You have to close your mouth.
-Then it'll come out of your nose.

393
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,710
So little smoke.

394
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,378
So little.

395
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,952
There's so little smoke,
he's like a bedside humidifier.

396
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,987
-A small one.
-A weak one.

397
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,356
-Those weak ones.
-A small, lamp-shaped one.

398
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,695
It doesn't come out at all.

399
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,866
You left your mouth open.

400
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,434
That was difficult.

401
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,371
-Because your mouth was open.
-It's really difficult.

402
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,243
Take it away. That thing.

403
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,545
Let's put it aside.

404
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,280
Wow, it's frozen!

405
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,748
It solidified!

406
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,784
-I'd love to pour beer in there.
-You'd have big problems.

407
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,687
I'd take the ice out.
The glass will still be chilled.

408
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:15,788
I see.

409
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,990
What a loud voice.

410
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,391
I see!

411
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,560
Your voice is loud. So loud.

412
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,696
-Miyasako has a loud voice.
-You're eating cheese?

413
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,964
Yes, I'm hungry.

414
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,133
-He has a real singer's voice.
-Right.

415
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,737
I want to hear your voice

416
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,839
Especially when he sings that.

417
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,741
That's not quite right.

418
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:35,975
That wasn't it?

419
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,613
I want to hear your voice

420
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,981
-Right?
-Wrong.

421
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,085
Just a little wrong.

422
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,487
Really?

423
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,822
"I want to hear your voice..."

424
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:55,428
I want to hear your voice

425
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,930
Our key was wrong?

426
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,898
"Money" by Shogo Hamada.

427
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,500
MONEY / SHOGO HAMADA

428
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,236
These are oogiri answers
that once got laughs.

429
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,440
-What about the questions?
-The oogiri game?

430
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,809
-You only have the answers?
-They're answers.

431
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,578
-Only answers?
-Is that all?

432
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,447
Come up with a question.
The answers will fit anything.

433
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,249
They'll fit any question?

434
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,352
I'll give you the answers, one by one.

435
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,587
I wrote down a lot.

436
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,423
-They'll work for any question?
-I think so.

437
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,125
Everybody hates this school. Tell us why.

438
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:29,128
Because for them,
it's just another autumn.

439
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,231
It works, right?

440
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,967
I guess it sounds nice...

441
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,336
-It appeals to the senses.
-It does.

442
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,438
-It sure has your "Iio-style."
-Really.

443
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,773
Okay, let me ask one.

444
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,844
After Kodama, Hikari, and Nozomi,

445
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,181
what will be the name
of the next bullet train?

446
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,752
Madrid's sunshine did it to him.

447
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,953
How long.

448
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,723
What kind of pet don't you want?

449
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,559
Thank you gifts at a funeral.

450
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,961
-The pet gives out the gifts?
-Probably.

451
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,863
-The pet does?
-Probably a black cat.

452
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,365
-Thank you gifts?
-See?

453
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,399
That's scary.

454
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,468
Say something about this photo.

455
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,172
After an intense education in Sweden,
I became a cherry boy.

456
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,848
After an intense education in Sweden,
I became a cherry boy.

457
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,183
Cherry boy?

458
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,754
That one fits.

459
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,923
What a miracle!
I simply flipped to the next page!

460
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,160
Maybe it's Sakata that fits everything.
Try doing it in reverse.

461
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,294
He's resonating.

462
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,397
Say something about this photo.

463
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,000
Carbonated drinks aren't the ideal partner
for sponge cake.

464
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:43,536
He's a gourmet.

465
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,441
If Master Sakata really said that,
it would be super funny.

466
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,643
This is bad.
Let's look at the photo first.

467
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,145
Don't just look at the answer.

468
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,646
-Do it over there.
-Okay.

469
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,281
That way everyone can see both.

470
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,216
-Will you help me?
-Nobu, sit down.

471
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,719
Which answer shall we give next?

472
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,387
This one?

473
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,656
Are you ready?

474
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,393
-Here we go.
-Take a good look at the photo.

475
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,729
Say something about this photo.

476
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,131
While we're waiting,

477
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,034
let's make a heartwarming sauce.

478
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,437
That's what he said.

479
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,210
-Amazing.
-That really is good.

480
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,344
It does fit.

481
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,348
-This could be bad.
-We started something bad.

482
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:30,983
And it's in Fujimoto's favor.

483
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,485
-You're right.
-Let's do it.

484
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,154
-It works in his favor.
-He's on the performing side.

485
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,657
Fujimoto should take a good look, too.

486
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,527
He nearly laughed already.

487
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:46,032
Fujimoto, if you show it this way,
we may end up laughing too.

488
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,636
Let's hear him sing!

489
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,438
"Money" by Shogo Hamada.

490
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,882
But he's not Shogo Hamada.

491
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,117
Next.

492
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,719
Say something about this photo.

493
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,055
This is what people call "love."

494
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,193
How did this happen?

495
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,529
Madrid's sunshine did it to him.

496
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,164
In the Spain.

497
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,501
"In the Spain" wasn't there before.

498
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:24,771
-Get it?
-Do you?

499
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,940
He's not usually like this.
Madrid's sunshine did it to him.

500
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,810
After an intense education in Sweden,
I became a cherry boy.

501
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,013
Cherry boy.

502
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,582
He had a Swedish education.

503
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,684
-The same as Maiko Kawakami.
-Right.

504
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,920
-Free sex.
-Swedish Education.

505
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,291
-Thank you gifts at a funeral.
-It's his nickname.

506
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:47,994
Master Sakata's, right?

507
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:49,996
Thank you gifts at a funeral.

508
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,464
Fujimoto is sly.

509
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,832
-He is.
-You're right.

510
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,035
-Why do you keep adding extra bits?
-What exactly is your role?

511
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,204
-"It's his nickname"?
-I'm the support.

512
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,006
-The support?
-The support...

513
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,510
Shall I write something new?

514
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:05,945
-Just say it.
-I'll write it.

515
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,780
-Right now?
-Now?

516
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,715
-Let's do this.
-In real time.

517
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,785
-Ready?
-That's a little...

518
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,420
-It's raw.
-Yeah.

519
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,856
-It will be a normal oogiri.
-An oogiri show.

520
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,024
That's not good.

521
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,358
It's an oogiri show.

522
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,460
Yes, sure. Thanks.

523
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,830
-Say a word for this photo.
-I love you.

524
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,935
Wait a minute!

525
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,237
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

526
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,106
Wait a minute!

527
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,510
Come on! Please! That was too much!

528
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,045
You cracked up.

529
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,581
-Well, well, well, well.
-That was a laugh.

530
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,050
No, I said something. It was my voice.

531
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,384
Voice, voice, voice!

532
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,354
-Your voice?
-It was my voice, Mr. Matsumoto!

533
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,889
You can't get away with that.

534
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,459
Nobu was doing that the whole time.

535
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:56,896
It was all just a matter of timing.

536
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,065
-Let's take a look.
-Okay.

537
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,368
-Say a word for this photo.
-I love you.

538
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,338
You're laughing.

539
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,640
Nobu!

540
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,742
You're eliminated!

541
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,583
This is bad!

542
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,252
Real bad!

543
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,587
I didn't think he'd be the first to go.

544
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:22,722
The very first.

545
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,757
-The first.
-The first?

546
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,260
My million...
There's no chance at the 10 million?

547
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,494
-No more.
-Nope.

548
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,663
-You'll be a zombie.
-Try to make amends.

549
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,499
-You'll have to be a good zombie.
-That's right.

550
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:34,767
"Nobu Zombie."

551
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,035
Nobu Zombie?

552
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,770
Isn't he unfunny?

553
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,106
You're right!

554
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,375
That's what might make me laugh.

555
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,310
-Because of that?
-Yeah.

556
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,546
I'm worried I'll laugh at
the nervous-looking zombie.

557
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,048
-Let's go, Nobu.
-Sure.

558
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,850
-Thank you.
-Bye, Nobu.

559
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,852
-But that was unfair.
-What was?

560
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,154
-They focused on me.
-Yeah, you're right.

561
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,189
-They did target you.
-Bye, Nobu!

562
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,658
Bye!

563
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,192
I'll come back as a zombie.

564
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,961
He'll be fine as a zombie.

565
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,230
Nobu as a zombie doesn't seem so bad.

566
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,667
That was pathetic.

567
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,770
But my defense is too weak.

568
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,939
I did. It's about the vasectomy.

569
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,373
-Nobu.
-Yes.

570
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,309
The new ones are...

571
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,481
Of course the air is full of tension,

572
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:25,618
but it's also pumped full of funniness.

573
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,820
-Say a word for this photo.
-I love you.

574
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,858
Wait a minute!

575
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,596
If you could poke it with a needle,
it would explode in an instant.

576
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,634
I'm so upset.

577
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,340
Let's go.

578
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,676
It started.

579
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,079
There's sashimi, kimchi, meat
and other stuff.

580
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,816
-We have meat?
-We can either cook or order.

581
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,519
I think it would be nicer
if we ate what's here.

582
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,487
You'll cook?

583
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,556
-Wow!
-That's a super premium cut.

584
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,623
Please cook that.

585
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,792
-You're a good cook, right?
-I can cook.

586
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,361
Does anyone want apple juice?

587
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,528
Yes, please.

588
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,630
Get it yourself! You're a junior to me.

589
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,399
Sorry. What a rapid development.

590
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,136
-Why don't you drink some milk?
-You don't mind?

591
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,706
-Do we have milk?
-Show Daigo how you drink milk.

592
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,041
Daigo?

593
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,944
-Wait. Wait a minute.
-You started it.

594
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,612
He can drink the milk.

595
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,547
But we all watch.

596
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,149
Will your mustache be okay?

597
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,984
It's no problem.

598
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:33,986
Wait, Kurochan.

599
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,125
-It was your idea.
-It was my idea.

600
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,861
But I said to him,
"Why don't you drink for everyone?"

601
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,896
You didn't say "for everyone."

602
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,365
-Daigo was the one who asked.
-Show it to Daigo.

603
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,135
-Can I drink some?
-Yes, but if you go too fast...

604
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,370
The milk will stick to your mustache.

605
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,538
I don't mind.

606
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,573
-Cheers.
-Bottoms up.

607
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,909
Dunk it in. He dunked all of it in.

608
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,884
He dribbled the same way again.

609
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,786
It really doesn't stick.

610
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:10,790
-It comes out this side every time.
-That's funny.

611
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,025
-Drink some more.
-You don't mind?

612
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:14,794
Thank you.

613
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,030
-That will stick.
-It'll stick now.

614
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,165
That will...

615
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,633
You got it.

616
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,911
We don't need that face.

617
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,148
This will stick.

618
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,384
How much is he drinking?

619
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,919
He sounds like a sewer.

620
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,253
That'll stick.

621
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,358
Don't say he sounds like a sewer.

622
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,461
But he went "blub blub," like a sewer.

623
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,495
-What?
-Cheers.

624
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,563
That's enough.

625
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,664
Why?

626
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,134
-Hear that slop?
-Enough, right?

627
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,569
Want me to cook it?

628
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,471
-Yeah. Good idea.
-Really?

629
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,472
That was too much.

630
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,207
-Let's see how it goes.
-Sure.

631
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,875
Wow, is this cookable?

632
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,810
Shall we cut it?

633
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,512
It's amazing.

634
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:07,746
It's thick.

635
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,215
-Wow.
-It's barbecue time.

636
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:11,517
It's so thick.

637
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,853
Why don't we fry it as a schnitzel?

638
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:18,157
-The show would end before it's done.
-We'd end up becoming a cooking show.

639
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,658
That won't work?

640
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,361
-If we added eggs we could do it.
-Okay.

641
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:31,637
Are you okay?

642
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:33,439
He's furious.

643
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:36,542
-He got dirty, now he's furious.
-I got meat juice on me.

644
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:37,843
Stop being so fussy.

645
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,246
-There's meat juice on my jacket.
-Don't fret.

646
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,550
Is that an expensive jacket?

647
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,493
I was wondering if it was expensive.

648
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,363
You always seem to get worried about
things like that.

649
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,098
Do we have a wet towel?

650
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,466
Shall I make one?

651
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,802
Forget about it. You can get dirty today.

652
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,138
Let me do a Lightning Bolt.

653
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,606
No Lightning Bolts, please.

654
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,074
Lightning Bolt?

655
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,743
What's a Lightning Bolt?

656
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,344
Miyasako, let's not.

657
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,615
I was just trying to
cook the meat for everyone.

658
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,185
You may be wearing expensive clothes,
but that's...

659
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,053
-You know.
-Is this necessary?

660
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:22,488
Lightning Bolt?

661
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:25,157
-Lend me your back.
-What's a Lightning Bolt?

662
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,560
-Wait a minute.
-You can keep your clothes on.

663
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,094
Straighten up.

664
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,229
Keep your clothes on.

665
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,531
-Keep them on.
-There's Haranishi.

666
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,734
-It's Haranishi.
-Haranishi? There he is.

667
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:36,735
Wait a minute.

668
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:39,171
I'm your senior.
We've known each for so long.

669
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,073
-You can't talk like that.
-But I...

670
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,409
I won't allow it. Stand at this angle.

671
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,476
Really, don't...

672
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,011
-I'm scared.
-What's going on?

673
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,550
Ouch!

674
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:53,652
He's crying.

675
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,288
I've never seen him make that face.

676
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,557
-A grown adult.
-He's like Chaplin.

677
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,060
It hurt even over his clothes.

678
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,394
You and your big mouth.

679
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,431
-I was cooking the meat for you guys.
-You're right.

680
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,465
He deserved it.

681
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,200
He always gets so fussy.

682
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:09,868
You're still going?

683
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,804
Miyasako, seriously.

684
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,706
You always try to show off.

685
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,611
Sit down.

686
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,547
-Sit.
-What will you do?

687
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:22,548
Just sit down.

688
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,017
Why do you keep talking back?

689
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,353
That's not good.

690
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,260
That doesn't look good.

691
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,495
That was a really scary one.

692
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,230
That was... He flipped.

693
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,599
-He lost it.
-Scary.

694
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:43,302
Fujimoto!

695
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,704
He's doing it again.

696
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,086
How cute. Just like a cat.

697
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,329
-You shouldn't have glared at him.
-It's your fault.

698
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,500
Fujimoto...

699
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,335
-You're making it worse.
-Stop it.

700
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,504
You're both seniors, so...

701
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,276
-Watch out.
-That hurts.

702
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,644
That's a tough one.

703
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:30,949
Wow.

704
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,233
Like COWCOW.

705
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,673
Everyone endured it.

706
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,109
They did. They hung in there.

707
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,314
Kukky was very close to losing it.

708
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,482
Please.

709
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,318
-Keep it friendly, guys.
-Sure.

710
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,620
-I'll cook the meat.
-Thank you.

711
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,289
-They reconciled.
-Sorry.

712
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,825
Did you fool around like that
when you were in Tenso?

713
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,961
We've always fooled around.

714
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,397
Like we just did, for years now.

715
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,934
-That takes me back.
-But now, my bones are out of place.

716
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,302
Especially in my skull.

717
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,270
He has a sadistic side, right?

718
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,573
Toward comedians and mistresses.

719
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,007
Mistresses?

720
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,143
He doesn't have any mistresses, does he?

721
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,582
-Do you do that to women, too?
-I heard he was kind.

722
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,883
He is kind.

723
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,585
Very kind. But...

724
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:42,654
When he's in bed...

725
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,056
What?

726
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,259
Are you starting something again?

727
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,831
My son's a high school junior, you know?

728
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,734
-How dare you say that?
-Sorry.

729
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,569
-I lied.
-Why?

730
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:58,971
Is this the mouth that lied?

731
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,007
-It was just a joke.
-Did this mouth lie?

732
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:04,209
-It was a joke.
-It was this mouth, right?

733
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:10,816
Directly?

734
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,018
Directly?

735
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,322
Really. My jaw will fall out.

736
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:32,905
You had to say it.

737
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:35,974
But it hurts.

738
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,713
It really hurts.

739
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,283
Looks like Hannya.

740
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,851
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

741
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,823
-Was it that bad?
-It was.

742
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,858
With a little more force...

743
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,194
-One more jerk?
-It would've fallen off.

744
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,496
-You mean dislocated?
-I mean ripped out.

745
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:58,997
Like in The Mask?

746
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,933
-The movie?
-The film The Mask.

747
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,736
But if your jaw bounced back,
what would be the first thing you say?

748
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,772
-I wonder.
-What would you say?

749
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,340
It stretches a meter, right?

750
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,777
If your jaw drops and comes back,
the skin here would be all saggy.

751
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:14,346
What would you say when it bounced back?

752
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:15,747
Is that another oogiri?

753
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,150
That was the topic.

754
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,954
Please don't make me do it.

755
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,425
What do you say after your jaw drops
to the floor and bounces back?

756
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,793
Ginkaku.

757
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,096
What...

758
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,599
What does that mean?

759
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,303
What do you say after your jaw drops
to the floor and bounces back?

760
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,204
I love you.

761
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,542
Quit making that noise.

762
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,145
I don't like going from
"I love you" to "sizzle."

763
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,780
I think it's the perfect sound.

764
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,250
That must have come close.

765
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,553
-Couldn't be helped.
-It was great.

766
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,255
Wow. It barely fits.

767
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,489
That's sizzling.

768
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,325
Is rare okay?

769
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,895
Looks good. I'll flip it.

770
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,102
-Do we have butter or something?
-Sounds good.

771
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,437
I don't remember seeing goodies like that.

772
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,274
There are condiments, I think.

773
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,509
Like spices.

774
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,503
How stimulating.

775
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,509
It was too stimulating.

776
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,722
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

777
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,657
There were shells

778
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,959
in the omelet.

779
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,495
-Shells in the omelet?
-That was an omelet?

780
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,931
-There were eggshells.
-Eggshells in the omelet.

781
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,400
This...

782
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,871
-You got sick because of eggshells?
-Yes.

783
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:00,906
I see.

784
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,442
That's why you threw up.

785
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,377
I'm sorry.

786
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,582
I'm using so many of these.

787
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,217
Don't move.

788
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,920
I've used so many towels.

789
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,025
I feel sick.

790
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,927
It broke.

791
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,398
So spicy.

792
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:27,566
That was so spicy.

793
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,676
It's stuck in my teeth.

794
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,225
These are bladder control sheets.

795
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,963
-This one too?
-None work.

796
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,766
Nothing works.

797
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,937
It's off now.

798
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,741
Kukky is up to something, too.

799
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:11,843
It's working.

800
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,178
Ouch!

801
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,766
Hey, Iio.

802
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,134
Iio?

803
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,413
CARBONATED WATER

804
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,488
Is Iio laughing?

805
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,634
-Huh?
-Who was it?

806
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,237
-Who laughed?
-It wasn't me.

807
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,105
Huh?

808
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,847
Well, I saw Iio...

809
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,814
No!

810
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,316
He was laughing.

811
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:25,517
What?

812
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:26,985
-Really?
-Yeah.

813
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,328
-That's laughing, right?
-Yes.

814
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,930
He was laughing, right?

815
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,100
The thing is, it was so slimy,
I nearly vomited.

816
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,237
-You laughed at the sliminess?
-I laughed at the sliminess...

817
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,838
Did I really laugh?

818
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:48,874
What happened?

819
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,009
Really! It was so slimy...

820
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,578
Okay, I'll make that an orange card.

821
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,314
Why did I put that in my mouth?

822
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:58,250
So, well...

823
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,086
Iio will be eliminated with his next card.

824
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,454
I'm sorry.

825
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,189
Putting that in your mouth was gutsy.

826
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:07,559
While I was watching in the back,
what impressed me the most was

827
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,195
after you gave an answer to the oogiri,

828
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,930
the meat went "sizzle."

829
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,469
What do you say after your jaw drops
to the floor and bounces back?

830
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,370
I love you.

831
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:22,874
Quit making that noise.

832
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,311
I don't like going from
"I love you" to "sizzle."

833
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,946
I think it's the perfect sound.

834
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,448
That must have come close.

835
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,819
-It's amazing how you kept straight faces.
-But it sure was funny.

836
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,288
You endured it well.

837
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,123
It suddenly sounded like home.

838
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,625
-Suddenly it sounded homey.
-All in one "sizzle."

839
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,194
-We couldn't be further away.
-So homey.

840
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,501
Let's go.

841
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,673
Maybe that's why he went ahead.

842
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,076
He's doing that thing. I bet you.

843
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,378
-He must be.
-He is.

844
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,647
Kukky, wait. I don't want it.

845
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,788
This is bad.

846
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,723
Really bad.

847
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,064
Kukky, it's almost ready.

848
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:33,745
Who are you supposed to be?

849
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,283
Shinya Yamamoto.

850
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,223
Shinya Yamamoto?

851
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,092
-The director.
-The film director?

852
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,597
If I say I'm Shinya Yamamoto,
I'm Shinya Yamamoto, damn it.

853
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,305
He has to remove that thing to talk?

854
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,640
-It must be hard to speak.
-It must be.

855
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,678
Have Yamamoto's teeth always been so...

856
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,313
Do they protrude so much?

857
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,781
His teeth don't stick out.

858
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:11,783
He's not that pale.

859
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,918
He's not that bald, either.

860
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,898
Stop cooking that meat
so smart and cheerfully.

861
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,042
Excuse me.

862
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,622
My bad. Sorry.

863
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:57,829
What are you doing here?

864
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,865
It's great.

865
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,867
It's great.

866
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:05,336
I'm out here on location.

867
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:07,705
Excuse me.

868
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:13,678
It's a great location,
so I came to check it out, naturally.

869
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,314
Shinya checks things out, you know?

870
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,050
It's the director.
He's just like the director.

871
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:25,723
Are you shooting a movie?

872
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,828
-Excuse me.
-Please stop putting that there.

873
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:31,596
It's someone's head.

874
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,798
I think it's best not to.

875
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,267
Okay?

876
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:37,602
Sorry.

877
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:43,608
Let me put this on you.

878
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,114
What are you doing?

879
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,715
Excuse me.

880
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:53,985
You were being polite?

881
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,956
It must be a lot different
without direct contact.

882
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:00,058
But...

883
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,562
Let's eat the meat.

884
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:07,699
Are you staying?

885
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,801
You'll stay like that?

886
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:11,736
Seriously?

887
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:17,909
-Iio?
-Yes.

888
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:19,210
Look properly.

889
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,446
The director has joined us.

890
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,381
But Fujimoto...

891
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:24,716
-You have to...
-No.

892
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,085
Can you share the dinner table with him?

893
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,025
Let's eat.

894
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,361
Miyasako...

895
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,597
-Please serve the meat. I can't stand it.
-Wow.

896
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:43,835
What's wrong?

897
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,337
Why are you having trouble
putting them in?

898
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,605
It was smooth before.

899
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,307
The moisture.

900
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,278
The moisture makes them expand.

901
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,980
-What was that?
-What did he say?

902
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,216
These dentures...

903
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,318
The moisture...

904
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,054
Moisture...

905
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:06,958
It makes them expand.

906
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:52,937
That's evil.

907
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,540
They're evil.

908
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,277
Take them out...

909
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,145
If you want to eat, take them out.

910
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,617
That's evil.

911
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,611
-That was gross!
-That was long!

912
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,146
That lasted so long.

913
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,152
You okay, Daigo? Sorry about that.

914
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,954
That really was insane.

915
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,257
I nearly lost it when
that banana came out.

916
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,360
Damn it!

917
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,162
That was close!

918
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,631
He didn't even get one bite.

919
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:56,768
I'm exhausted.

920
00:48:57,802 --> 00:48:59,504
That was tiring for us, too.

921
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:01,839
I didn't eat a thing.

922
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:04,542
You didn't even get one bite!

923
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,278
Every one of you came close.

924
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,914
How could you endure that?

925
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,849
He was actually too close to see.

926
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,751
-That was nasty.
-He was too close.

927
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,721
It was the distance
between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien.

928
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,658
-The second one.
-Aliens.

929
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:22,393
That's how close they were there.

930
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,329
But I think he saved you all there.

931
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:25,930
It was thanks to Miyasako.

932
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,966
That tension was unbearable.

933
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,301
Let's take a look.

934
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:33,304
-That was impossible.
-I'm sure it was.

935
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,828
-What else could I do?
-You had no choice.

936
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,596
-That was impossible.
-It sure was.

937
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,932
Miyasako gets his first card.

938
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:03,134
-Yellow.
-He endured so much.

939
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,153
Zombie Time!

940
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,155
I forgot about that!

941
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,624
I can't take it anymore!

942
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,593
It's insane!
