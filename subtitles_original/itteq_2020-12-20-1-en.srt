1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,400
"The Quest"

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,560
"This programme aired
on 3rd January 2021"

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,280
Ladies and gentlemen...

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,440
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,160
The Quest, New Year Special
has started!

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,760
Yeah!

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,960
I heard through the grapevine
that Chen went all out,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,880
so his footage is longer,
but mine was cut out.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,000
- Is that how it works?
- Is that so?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,880
Now, the first bit is this!

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,120
A New Year party trick tour,
challenged accepted by Uchimura!

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,640
Yeah!

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,400
A tour?

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,720
Acquire...

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,520
What? But it's a tour?

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
So we visit several places?

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,160
Yes, you'll tour around
acquiring party tricks.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,520
- But, a tour?
- He's stuck on the word tour.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,320
It'll take time.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,640
Aren't you concerned about the idea
of acquiring party tricks?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,240
I'm more concerned about the tour,

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,640
than acquiring party tricks.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,640
He will go on tour to find...

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,600
three traditional and unique
performances around Japan.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,120
Wait a second.

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,440
Am I doing this alone?

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,000
- It will be a lonesome process.
- He doesn't like that.

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,520
Actually, this time,

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,000
- since you get lonely easily--
- I don't get lonely easily.

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,000
I never said that
I get lonely easily.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,560
I said that it would be
a lonesome crusade.

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,520
For this quest, he will have a buddy
for each trick he tries to acquire.

33
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,520
By doing this, we can avoid
periods of silence where we say,

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,920
"What? Is there any point to having
a mic on him?"

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
as we observe Uchimura on location.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
They are totally dissing you.

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,400
Are these buddies nice people?

38
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,040
I won't know who they are
until the day?

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,320
Right, we'll let you know
who it is on that day.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,320
I see.

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,720
Please look forward to it.

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,400
It's probably a crew member anyway,
right?

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,360
Challenges by Teruyoshi Uchimura,
56 years old,

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,160
is starting!

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,320
Amazing!

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
- So I'm not alone.
- Okay.

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,440
I went to challenge the acquiring
with a guest. It was reassuring.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,960
The third guest is very special.

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,160
- I still can't believe it.
- What?

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,080
- Please look forward to it.
- What?

51
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,200
- I get why my segment is longer.
- What?

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,400
Who is it?

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,720
- Now... Well, please watch it.
- Who could it be?

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,960
Let's get started!

55
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,120
- The Quest! It's me.
- Yeah!

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,400
New Year party trick
acquisition tour!

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,200
He first travelled to Aichi.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,560
What am I going to acquire here?

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,840
Here it is.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
"Ikadashi raftsmen"

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,640
- Ikadashi raftsmen.
- What is that?

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,040
- What is that?
- What does it mean?

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
What is this?

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,880
It's a special trick where several
performances are done...

65
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,440
on floating timber.

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Are you telling me
to acquire this in a day?

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
- Yes.
- Is that possible?

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
- Me?
- Me...

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Uchimura has a lot going on
at the end of the year.

70
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,320
He only has three days
to acquire three tricks.

71
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,880
That means he has to master
one trick per day.

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,920
Remember we said you'll have
a buddy for each trick?

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,400
- Right.
- The Ikadashi raftsmen festival...

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
is a traditional festival
held once a year.

75
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,200
Oh, it's a festival?

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,320
So now, here's your buddy
for this event!

77
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,720
- Yeah! Now!
- Yes!

78
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,680
- There he is!
- We are here...

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,320
- in Aichi!
- He's doing it!

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Please watch!

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,760
It's been so long, he's excited.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
- This is the view...
- He's excited.

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
from the castle tower.

84
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,280
There's a location shoot
going on right there.

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
And he's waving at me.
Thank you very much.

86
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,200
Now, we intend to work hard
as a team.

87
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Timber!

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Bring it on!

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Today, they won't be participating
in the festival,

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,280
but he's bringing his festive spirit
of "festival fellow" to practise.

91
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Uchimura-san, if you would please...

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
That tracksuit is a bit...

93
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,800
- It doesn't have pockets either.
- Buy one with pockets, then!

94
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
It's like the cheapest kind!
The cheapest kind of tracksuit.

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,160
- Ah! This is great.
- It sure is nice.

96
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,320
All right! Give me a helmet!

97
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,720
- Give me a helmet!
- Oh, how nostalgic!

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,600
They head right away to the pool
where they are to practise.

99
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,600
Uchimura and Miyagawa,
please have a look over there.

100
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,880
- What!
- What!

101
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,240
What did the duo see over there?

102
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,560
A chap in dreadlocks rotating
a log on the water.

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,600
- That looks hard.
- What is this?

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
The Port of Nagoya in Aichi
flourished as a collection site...

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,880
for timber since the Edo period.

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Many timber merchants
acquired this raftsmen skill,

107
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
while they worked on the timber.

108
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,480
Enthralling tricks were created,
along with its long history.

109
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,360
What is this?
I've never seen that before.

110
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,000
A three-point handstand
on the chin?

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
It's Shachihoko.

112
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
- Shachihoko.
- Shachihoko, since we're in Aichi.

113
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay.

114
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
This is "Kago-nori."

115
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,640
This skill can only be done when
they are in sync with one another.

116
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,800
That's incredible.

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
Amazing.

118
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,400
It's amazing. It's too amazing.

119
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,120
No mistakes.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
You will have five hours
to acquire this skill.

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,720
Impossible!

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
- It looks extremely difficult.
- Yes.

123
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,720
Those two didn't look like
they were enjoying it either.

124
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,400
I think it's difficult.

125
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,760
His hair is in dreadlocks
and he appears cheerful,

126
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,480
but his face isn't smiling at all.

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
- You have to concentrate...
- That's how much focus you need.

128
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
or you won't be able to do it.

129
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Let's try to not get injured.

130
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,160
- Yes.
- I meant, three hours to learn.

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,760
- Let's practise.
- Let's get started!

132
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,680
This is hard.

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,640
They've shown too many tricks.

134
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
No, seriously.

135
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,760
Of course you can pick any of them,
as long as you can do it.

136
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,000
Any of them?
No, this is the only one.

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,240
That one done with two people
was cool.

138
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,120
This one is incredible too,
you know.

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,320
Why did you show that thing?
That was a mistake.

140
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,240
You know...

141
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,400
Five hours later.

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,760
Let's see how far they get
in five hours!

143
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,520
Their instructors are Ikadashi
raftsmen, Tejima and Kusaka.

144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,320
You hold a long pole
to maintain balance,

145
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,280
and you place the arch of your foot
on the edge of a rectangular log.

146
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,680
That's amazing. It won't turn.

147
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,720
You're holding it down
with your right foot.

148
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,760
Here and here.

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,000
This is what you're doing.

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,120
Then you maintain this position.

151
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,800
Then all you do is turn it.

152
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,160
I mean, you're right, but...

153
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,280
The technique
was naturally cultivated...

154
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
as a result of managing
and transporting timber.

155
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,360
They learnt it through action,
rather than by thinking.

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,440
I think I can do it.

157
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,240
I got it.

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,880
Learning to keep their balance
on the log,

159
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
with the instructor's assistance.

160
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,800
Instructor, I'm moving farther
and farther.

161
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
Mr Tejima.

162
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,080
Ah!

163
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,800
It turned!

164
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
When your body moves,
the timber moves too.

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Mr Tejima!

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
That was close, Mr Tejima.

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
That's hard.

168
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't want to fall right now.

169
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
Next, it's Miyagawa's turn.

170
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,800
Oh, I see.

171
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,600
I see.

172
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,800
I see.

173
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
So this is it.

174
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
- That's good.
- You're doing good.

175
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,960
Miyagawa's balancing skill
is superb. He tries to rotate it.

176
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Be careful! Okay!

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,640
- Okay!
- Wow! It's reversing!

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,440
Watch out! Oh no!

179
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,880
What? Wait a minute.

180
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
Why is the water so cold?

181
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,680
This is not a heated pool!

182
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
Huh?

183
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
- Hey! This is cold water!
- It's not heated.

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,880
It's a diving pool,
so it's not heated.

185
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,440
What kind of reason is that?

186
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,920
Why didn't you get a heated pool
instead of a diving pool?

187
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,840
We looked for a pool
that would let us put logs in,

188
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
we couldn't find any
that were heated.

189
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,480
Of course, that's only natural!

190
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,240
Where would you find a pool
that lets you put logs in it?

191
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,720
That's why it's done in rivers!

192
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,360
And the only one that let us
put timber in their pool...

193
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,320
- was Max Diving.
- Thank you very much.

194
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,560
It's turning.

195
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,160
Uchimura!

196
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,760
The water temperature
is 19 degrees Celsius.

197
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,800
That's how cold
the Izu sea is in winter.

198
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,160
I need to get used to this.

199
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,200
Is it all shut? Is it shut?

200
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,520
We need to ventilate
once in a while,

201
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,120
but let's keep it shut
as much as possible.

202
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
We do need to ventilate.

203
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,200
They manage to stand on the log...

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,200
- without assistance.
- That's good.

205
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
I get it.

206
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,080
When learning to turn it, the level
of difficulty increases at once.

207
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,960
Careful!

208
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,760
Careful! Careful!

209
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
It's freezing.

210
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
I poked a hole with the pole.

211
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,560
- Oh no!
- It's cold!

212
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
- Seriously. Seriously.
- Oh no.

213
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,520
- This is really so hard.
- He ripped a hole.

214
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,360
They've been practising for an hour,

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,240
but they can't see themselves
being able to do it.

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
I forgot to mention this...

218
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
What? He forgot to mention what?

219
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
- What?
- What?

220
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,760
If you place your feet here,

221
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
- Yes?
- you'll slip...

222
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,920
and it will be devastating.

223
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
You go from edge,

224
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
to edge,

225
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,960
to edge.

226
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Got it?

227
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,240
That was crucial information!

228
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,760
You place your feet on the next edge
in a constant rhythm.

229
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Then the log will turn in the water
and move backwards.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Their goal for this task...

231
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,720
is to rotate it eight metres
to the other side of the pool.

232
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,040
"Goal for this task.
Cross eight meters"

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,560
However, it's an infinite distance
for them.

234
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,440
- They're wearing wetsuits now.
- Oops.

235
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,840
Ah...

236
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,680
That sounded odd.

237
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,480
In a diving pool,

238
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,880
two men are taking turns
trying to rotate a log,

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,360
only to fall in the water,
over and over again.

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Did you open it?

241
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,120
- Because it's hot?
- No, it's for ventilation.

242
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,520
It's freezing in here.

243
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm sorry. I opened it.

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Why didn't you tell me?

246
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,240
I opened it for ventilation.

247
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm sorry. Let's ventilate.

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Let me know if it's Uchimura!

249
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,160
It's cold, and they must be careful
not to get injured.

250
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,000
- Right!
- Ouch!

251
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,760
He slipped and took a heavy blow
to his crotch.

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
- You did it?
- Yes...

253
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
I hit my bum.

254
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,520
In addition, Uchimura...

255
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,480
I twisted it a little.

256
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
- He injured his ankle.
- Oh no.

257
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
Do you have any tape?

258
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
We do.

259
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,280
I'll strap it.

260
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
However...

261
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,320
How about we strap it in a cross?

262
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,800
No one knows how to do it.

263
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
They don't have a professional
to handle this?

264
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,280
They are troubled.

265
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,600
It's sort of treated.

266
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Whether this is correct or not,

267
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,320
no one knows.

268
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,760
As they continue to practise,
they start to cover more distance.

269
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
In addition...

270
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,800
They are practising...

271
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,840
how to strap up.

272
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,280
They make use of a smartphone...

273
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,520
to master how to strap an injury.

274
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,800
- Okay! This is good now.
- Good.

275
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,200
During their five-hour practise,

276
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
the two of them went on the log...

277
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,640
- a total of 146 times.
- 146 times?

278
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,960
Were they able to acquire...

279
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,440
this Ikadashi raftsmen skill?

280
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,360
- Party trick performance!
- That's fast.

281
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,000
- Party trick performance!
- That's fast.

282
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,240
We shall present the Ikadashi
raftsmen skill from Nagoya, Aichi.

283
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,840
We shall cross to the opposite bank
on the timber.

284
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,480
Please give us a huge round
of applause when we succeed.

285
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,760
Let's do this!

286
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,080
Yoh!

287
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,120
First, raftsman Miyagawa
will demonstrate.

288
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,000
Now!

289
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,320
Please understand why I'm wet.

290
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,960
Yoh!

291
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,800
It's eight metres
to the opposite side.

292
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,480
- It's started to turn.
- He's good!

293
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,720
Ladies and gentlemen...

294
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,640
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

295
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
- That's amazing.
- He's good.

296
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,840
- That's amazing! Come on!
- Carefully, very carefully...

297
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
It's turning. It's turning.

298
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,080
He's unsteady, but he continues
while using a pole for balance.

299
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,760
It's turning. It's turning.

300
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,920
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

301
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,120
I hope this year will be great...

302
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,760
- for everyone.
- We will pray... A little more.

303
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,560
And...

304
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,440
Yes!

305
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,800
- Miyagawa succeeds!
- Great!

306
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,760
- Next up is raftsman Uchimura.
- Come on!

307
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
- Yoh!
- Yoh!

308
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,480
- Oh?
- Yoh?

309
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,280
- Yoh!
- Yoh!

310
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
- Yoh!
- Yoh!

311
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,840
- Yoh!
- Yoh.

312
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120
Yoh!

313
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,480
- Yoh.
- Yoh.

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
- Now!
- He won't start.

315
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,680
Now he started. There he goes.

316
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
It's an Ikadashi raftsman skill
presented by Uchimura.

317
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,000
Once he crosses the pool
successfully, please clap for him.

318
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,760
- Yoh.
- Yoh.

319
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
- It's looking good.
- Yoh.

320
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
- Yoh!
- Come on!

321
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,360
- Happy New Year! It's turning.
- Yoh!

322
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,360
Yoh!

323
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,240
He fell in the water halfway.

324
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,280
That's it!

325
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,200
He wasn't able to acquire
this party trick.

326
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
Oh my... That's one done.

327
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,680
Yes.

328
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,400
I was told you have two more.

329
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
I don't know if I'll last.

330
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,960
But the presence of a buddy
is helpful.

331
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll be driven into a corner
if I'm alone.

332
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,960
- Thank you for your help.
- Not at all.

333
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

334
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
Ikadashi raftsmen's skill.

335
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,160
Let's move on to the next segment.

336
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
New Year's party trick
acquisition tour! First one's done.

337
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,280
That's amazing.

338
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,040
Festival fellow is awesome, right?

339
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,040
- Not at all.
- He's amazing.

340
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,400
He managed to advance
that much in a day.

341
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
- No, no.
- While he's talking, too.

342
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,560
- Right.
- Not at all.

343
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,160
He really saved me.

344
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,680
If I went on location by myself,

345
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,480
I'd have to make it happen,
no matter what.

346
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,040
I just gave up.

347
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,760
That's rare for him.

348
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,560
He said "That's it."

349
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
That's it!

350
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,720
Uchimura heads over to Tokyo
seeking his next trick.

351
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,240
He'll attempt a unique performance
that's hot right now.

352
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,320
Here it is.

353
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,880
A balance ball skipping rope?

354
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,720
It's impossible!

355
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,280
He will use a balance ball
and skipping rope.

356
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
- This is your buddy for this trick.
- Okay.

357
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,920
Who is it?

358
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,840
Uchimura-san!

359
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,880
Nakaoka will accompany you!

360
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh, you got me.

361
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,880
You got me. I had no idea.

362
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
It's the former
first-class comedian...

363
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
It's not "former."

364
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
Nakaoka.

365
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,120
- Former first-class comedian.
- Two first-class comedians co-star.

366
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,960
The balance ball skipping rope skill
will be taught by...

367
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,640
Hello.

368
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,240
Sisters.
Aki, who's in middle school,

369
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,680
and her older sister, Airi,
who's a university student.

370
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,160
I see.

371
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,360
They won first place in a national
balance ball competition as a pair.

372
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,720
They are Japan's best
balance ball sisters.

373
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,600
- Amazing!
- They have amazing cores.

374
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,120
And a wonderful performance
of balance ball skipping rope.

375
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,080
You hold the balance ball
between your legs,

376
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,680
and jump lightly.

377
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
That's super hard.

378
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,960
Amazing.

379
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
That's incredible.

380
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,840
It's impossible!

381
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,040
You'll practise for five hours
to do this.

382
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,760
Five hours.

383
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,680
The five hours will be condensed.

384
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
- Condensed.
- It will be.

385
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,360
- This is not good.
- This is not good.

386
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
This kind of job is not good.

387
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,320
Let's start practising.

388
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,040
First, they get used to
the balance ball, with assistance.

389
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,280
It looks like a health centre.

390
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,240
Oh no!

391
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,560
- Oh no.
- When I looked up close,

392
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
I saw a man in his mid-50s.

393
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,880
They switch.

394
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,160
Don't look at me.

395
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't look at me
with a smile on your face.

396
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,880
It's starting to become fun.

397
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,760
You're good.

398
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,920
I think I'm pretty good at this.

399
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,200
I don't like this.

400
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,240
I don't like this practise.

401
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,000
Now they'll practise holding a ball
between their legs and jumping.

402
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,440
It's hard trying to hold it
between your legs.

403
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,040
Uchimura.

404
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,240
Uchimura.

405
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
Uchimura.

406
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,280
- Uchimura.
- Oh no.

407
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,480
Uchimura.

408
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,320
Uchimura.

409
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,680
- Uchimura.
- Don't keep saying "Uchimura."

410
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,400
Don't whisper my name like that.

411
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,080
You idiot!

412
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,320
They're finally doing it solo.

413
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,480
- Oh! You've got it!
- That's amazing.

414
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,960
Oh! Amazing.

415
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,600
Uchimura is steadily improving.

416
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
But it's a long process from here.

417
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,560
I get this party trick location.

418
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,880
He's right. He's going to attempt
to skip rope for this one.

419
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,440
It's necessary to jump higher
to be able to skip rope.

420
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,040
You stand behind the ball.

421
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,080
Then you jump on,
and you use the momentum...

422
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,840
to jump higher.

423
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
I see.

424
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,040
But that makes it harder
to maintain balance.

425
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,480
I wonder if I'm putting
too much force on it.

426
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,320
Oh!

427
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,800
Scary!

428
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,280
From this point on,
it's repetition as usual.

429
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
They repeat the same thing
over and over again.

430
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
Okay. It's hot.

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,040
It's hot?

432
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
It's hot.

433
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,960
It's hot.

434
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
It's hot.

435
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,400
It's tough.

436
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,600
It's tough. It's hot.

437
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm tired. This is hard.

438
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,280
It's hard. It's hot. It's tiring.
It's tough.

439
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Why am I doing this?

440
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
Why am I doing this?

441
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,320
It can't be helped.

442
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
I guess we don't have
the right to quit.

443
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,760
Seriously.

444
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,680
We don't have the right?

445
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,120
We don't. That's what Degawa said.

446
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,880
- There's no freedom here.
- Nope.

447
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,160
It's a mystery.

448
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
We'll go on strike in the spring.

449
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,720
Let's do something New Year's-like
to refresh!

450
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,440
Speedy mochi pounding.

451
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,440
Let's do something New Years-like
to refresh!

452
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,120
Speedy mochi pounding.

453
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Speedy mochi pounding?

454
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,080
I've seen it before.

455
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
It's super-fast and it's dangerous.

456
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Yes, it is.

457
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,160
Nakatanidou, located in Nara,
is known for its Yomogi mochi.

458
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,640
Speedy mochi pounding starts now.

459
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,280
Yoh!

460
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,240
Look at the magnificent teamwork
of these two.

461
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,000
It's so fast you can't see it.

462
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,400
No, no, no.

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,520
Pounding sweet sticky rice
while it's still hot...

464
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,400
results in soft and chewy mochi.

465
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,720
So, now you two will try
this speedy mochi pounding.

466
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,960
What are your intentions?

467
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,320
We came prepared with this.

468
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh, is it lighter?

469
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,080
It's a bit softer.

470
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,040
Ah.

471
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,400
No, it hurts.

472
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,280
- It hurts.
- This will hurt.

473
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
Speedy mochi-pounding performance.

474
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,240
- Let's show them.
- Okay.

475
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,520
- Let's show them.
- Ready?

476
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,720
Let's do it.

477
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,880
We did it, right?

478
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
- We did it.
- We did it.

479
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,480
What do you think?

480
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,160
I don't know what to say.

481
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,080
- They switch places.
- Let's go.

482
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,040
Let's go.

483
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,960
Now, the balance ball
skipping rope performance.

484
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,920
- That's fast!
- That's fast.

485
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,520
Each of them will get
three attempts.

486
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,880
If they are able to skip rope
three times, it's a success!

487
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,520
- That's so random.
- That's fast.

488
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Now...

489
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,280
It's Nakaoka's first attempt.

490
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
Come on!

491
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,880
I shall jump three times.

492
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
I'll start.

493
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,920
Ready...

494
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
That was close!

495
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,240
Oh my!

496
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,600
- Twice.
- You can do it.

497
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Twice!

498
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,760
It's Uchimura's first attempt.

499
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,920
Come on!

500
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,960
- I'll start.
- Come on.

501
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,240
Ready...

502
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,360
Ah...

503
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,000
Ah...

504
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,800
You failed quite miserably
on the actual try.

505
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,360
It's fine. We have more chances.

506
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,520
However, their second attempt.

507
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,800
Both Nakaoka...

508
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,080
and Uchimura...

509
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,360
failed.

510
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
That was close!

511
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
They have one more chance.

512
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,240
Here I go!

513
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,680
It's fine! You'll be able to do it!

514
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes!

515
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,760
- Come on!
- You can do it!

516
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,080
- All right.
- Come on!

517
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,960
The fateful...

518
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,200
third attempt.

519
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,200
First class...

520
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes, be first class!

521
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Yes!

522
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
Here I go.

523
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,920
Ready, go.

524
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,480
- Did I jump three times?
- He did it!

525
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,880
You scraped three jumps.
It should be okay.

526
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,120
Yes!

527
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Yes!

528
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Nakaoka tenaciously managed...

529
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,080
the balance ball skipping rope jump
three times.

530
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,160
It's a success!

531
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
Yes!

532
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,320
He shares his happiness
with the Takeuchi sisters.

533
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
You did it!

534
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,280
Sisters, good for you too.

535
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,240
However, the party trick acquisition
tour is Uchimura's segment.

536
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,800
Okay!

537
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Everyone is waiting for the star
to perform magnificently.

538
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,320
Here I go!

539
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
Go!

540
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,840
Ah...

541
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Uchimura's first attempt
lacked power and he failed.

542
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,320
Then his discontent
for this segment erupts.

543
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Oh no!

544
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh no!

545
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,480
You know!

546
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,080
- Could it be?
- Oh no!

547
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,720
Hey!

548
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,920
It's been a while!

549
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,360
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while!

550
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,960
- It's helmet guy in black!
- Oh no, we're in trouble.

551
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,560
Hey! The camera is too low!

552
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
This camera is too low!

553
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,080
Kids! Do you want me
to eat your zoni?

554
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,800
Do you want me to eat your zoni?
It's been a while!

555
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm the helmet guy in black.

556
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,680
I'm against this segment!

557
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,560
It's impossible!

558
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,320
I couldn't stay on the log,
I can't stay on a ball either. Hey!

559
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,360
Both of my buddies
have been successful!

560
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
And it's my segment.

561
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,480
It's my segment, and yet my buddies
are the only ones successful?

562
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,480
I won't go tomorrow!

563
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,720
I won't go tomorrow.

564
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,080
- Ah...
- He's sulking.

565
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm really upset.

566
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,720
The New Year's party trick
acquisition tour continues.

567
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,600
- That went fast in the footage.
- It did go fast.

568
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
We did it for five hours.

569
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,960
I expected it to be condensed,

570
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,240
but it was even shorter than that.

571
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,320
That was surprising, right?

572
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,880
Nakaoka is good, isn't he?

573
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
- He's amazing.
- Not at all.

574
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,800
There is a professional
for everything.

575
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,840
A professional like
the festival fellow, and QTuber.

576
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
- Both of them...
- You're right.

577
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,480
get their job done.

578
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,720
- These two are cool.
- Thank you very much.

579
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,920
I think you're back to being
a first-class comedian.

580
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,080
Thank you very much.

581
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,640
- He jumped three times.
- That was magnificent.

582
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,440
Now, it's the last segment
of the party trick acquisition tour.

583
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,880
We've come to Tokyo Meiji Kinenkan.

584
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,040
- We are at Meiji Kinenkan in Tokyo.
- I see.

585
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,720
But you'll be learning
a traditional act of some region.

586
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I see.

587
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,280
Here it is.

588
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
Chikuzen Hakata-koma.

589
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
- No idea, but it sounds hard.
- A spinning top?

590
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,680
It's a juggling performance where
a spinning top is spun everywhere,

591
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,440
such as on your palm or on a ball.

592
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,160
It's been designated by Fukuoka
as an intangible cultural asset.

593
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,360
This is a serious party trick.

594
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,280
- It's juggling, right?
- Yes, it is.

595
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,160
And his buddy for this trick...

596
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,120
is a special guest who is not
a Quest member.

597
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,680
Is this person an actor?
Or a big shot?

598
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't know what to give as a hint.

599
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,320
You don't know what to give
as a hint?

600
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,360
What kind of person is this that
you don't know what hint to give?

601
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
I don't know how to give it...

602
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,120
You don't know how to give it?

603
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
What?

604
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,800
Here's your buddy!

605
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
- This was Uchimura's secret idol.
- What?

606
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,560
He admires them?

607
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
There's clicking.

608
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
What? Who is it?

609
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,800
- A woman?
- That person is thin.

610
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,360
- Who is it?
- I suspect a woman.

611
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,240
Our special guest is actress
Yurina Hirate.

612
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,640
- Wow!
- What?

613
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
No, no, no.

614
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,120
- No, no, no!
- Is she real?

615
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,680
No, no, no!

616
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,160
Uchimura is a huge Hirate fan!

617
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,560
No way!

618
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,000
No way!

619
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,400
No way.

620
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,960
For real?

621
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,720
- Are you really her?
- Long-time no see.

622
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,400
- Are you really her?
- Yes, I am.

623
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,360
It's been a year since
they performed together...

624
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,560
- at Red and White Song Battle.
- Hold on.

625
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
I can't stand up.

626
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,040
I can't stand up right now.

627
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,280
She'll attempt to do Hakata-koma
with you.

628
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,120
Really?

629
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,680
It was unbelievable,
but I was very happy.

630
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,080
I thought this is how Imoto felt
when she met Namie Amuro.

631
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,480
The umbrella was bigger
than I thought,

632
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,160
I couldn't close it.

633
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,120
I was focused on doing that,

634
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,240
so I don't remember much
of anything else.

635
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,640
These two will challenge doing
Chikuzen Hakata-koma.

636
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,320
Here's our special guest,
Yurina Hirate!

637
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Yeah!

638
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,200
- Happy New Year!
- Hello.

639
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,880
Yurina, these are The Quest members.

640
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,640
Hello.

641
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,560
Hello.

642
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,320
- I admire her.
- Right.

643
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,320
We started after this, but I was
distracted for an hour.

644
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,960
His facial expression
was completely different.

645
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,800
Your voice was different.
You were speaking softer than usual.

646
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,280
We tried Hakata-koma,

647
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,080
how would you describe it
in one word?

648
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,600
It was difficult.

649
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,200
- So it was difficult.
- It was difficult.

650
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm sorry, Chen said a special guest
that's totally unexpected,

651
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,160
so I was thinking it was Nanbara.

652
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
No way!

653
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,120
You're completely off!

654
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,240
Let's get started.

655
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,640
- The Quest.
- The Quest.

656
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,360
- Yeah!
- Thank you very much.

657
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,640
That was great.

658
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
Uchimura and Hirate will attempt
to do Chikuzen Hakata-koma.

659
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,120
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

660
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,680
They'll be taught by Shuraku Chikuji
and Saira Chikuji,

661
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,680
inheritors of the spinning top art
from previous generations.

662
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,920
Is she your daughter?

663
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,160
No, she's my wife.

664
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,200
Your wife? What?

665
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,800
- She's young, right?
- Yes.

666
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,560
- Seriously?
- Yes.

667
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Mr Chikuji, you scored!

668
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,920
"28 years old, 45 years old.
Mr Chikuji, you scored"

669
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,920
I see.

670
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,680
First, the Chikuji clan will perform
top spinning tricks.

671
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,920
Hakata-koma doesn't use strings.

672
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,000
It's spun by hand,
which is one of its characteristics.

673
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,680
It's then placed on a fingertip.

674
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,920
- This is already amazing.
- Isn't it amazing?

675
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,080
He picks up a Japanese sword.

676
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,960
He will be demonstrating
the most difficult skill...

677
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
in the 470 years
of Hakata-koma's history, "Tobiume."

678
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
It's spinning.

679
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,720
It's on the sharp edge?

680
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,320
The spinning top moves across
the sharp blade as it's spinning.

681
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,120
Amazing.

682
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,440
There are no hidden magnets.

683
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,360
Excellent balancing skills.

684
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,560
It's impossible.

685
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,000
- It's impossible.
- He's saying it's impossible?

686
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,000
Here's another trick where it spins
across a string, "Daikoku."

687
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,120
This is "Suehiro," where he spins
the top on the edge of a fan.

688
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,320
Amazing.

689
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,800
There.

690
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,400
There are a total of 23 tricks.

691
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,160
- It's spinning diagonally
- How is that possible?

692
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
Why doesn't it fall?

693
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,960
The last performance...

694
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,320
is a cheerful trick that's perfect
to celebrate the New Year's.

695
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,760
- It's called "Mandou."
- Mandou?

696
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,280
When the top spins and climbs
up a string...

697
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,800
a kusudama is activated
by a special mechanism.

698
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,360
I wish for everyone to be happy.
Thank you very much.

699
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,200
That was incredible.

700
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,440
Amazing.

701
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,960
I would be pleased if you'd do
the last one I did.

702
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,720
If we could do that, it'd be cool...

703
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,280
I want to see you in action
and be cool, Uchimura-san.

704
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
Oh?

705
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,120
I'll do it.

706
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
I'll do it.

707
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,560
The two of you
will practise together,

708
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,320
so if she could put on
the practise outfit...

709
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
What?

710
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,680
- This?
- Please give it to her.

711
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,400
What?

712
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,680
Don't make her wear this.

713
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,880
What's wrong
with what she's wearing?

714
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,320
I think it'll be hard for her
to move in that.

715
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,760
She's perfectly fine in that.

716
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,440
Why do we have
to make her wear this?

717
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,280
- What's wrong with that?
- I would like to wear it.

718
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,240
- I want to wear it.
- She said she'll wear it.

719
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
She said she'll wear it.

720
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,760
They begin their training.
The first thing is spinning a top.

721
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,800
Rub your hands together like
you're flying a bamboo-copter toy.

722
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,600
Just like that.

723
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,440
Then you let it gather momentum,

724
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,920
and you keep repeating it.

725
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,280
If you can feel the stem rolling
between your palms...

726
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
It seems easy...

727
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,640
That's right.
When it's done by an expert.

728
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Hold on...

729
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,360
- Just spin it.
- This is quite difficult.

730
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,280
Whew...

731
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
Oh, she did it.

732
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,520
- She did it.
- She's amazing.

733
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,160
She learns fast.

734
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
Meanwhile,
Uchimura isn't learning fast.

735
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,080
Because inside his head is one part
spinning top, nine parts Yurina.

736
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,160
I really admire her.

737
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,280
- She's perfect...
- What is this?

738
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,960
with her dancing and her ability
to express herself.

739
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,160
I wanted to be that kind
of an entertainer.

740
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,600
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I don't get it much.

741
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,280
Of course you wouldn't get it.

742
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,680
I never thought...

743
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,120
I'd be spinning tops with her.

744
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,320
I was hoping the next occasion...

745
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,160
I'd see her would be
at some formal... you know?

746
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,520
Like on a talk show.

747
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,760
Like "Bokura no Jidai"?

748
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,280
Exactly! Like "Bokura no Jidai."

749
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,760
A show like that.

750
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,440
That's what I was thinking.

751
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,800
But, you have plenty of time to talk
while you're spinning tops with her.

752
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,760
After you get the segment...

753
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,400
you go to the studio...

754
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,720
Right, we watch the edited version
at the studio.

755
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,120
That's how it goes.

756
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,840
I mean, you don't appear much
on variety shows.

757
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,240
Right.

758
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,720
You only appear to promote
your shows pretty much, right?

759
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,680
Their conversation is too neutral.

760
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,760
Actually, it's a good thing
this isn't a talk show.

761
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
You don't appear much
on these types of shows.

762
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,680
- Get it together!
- Shut up.

763
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,280
I can spin it with one hand.

764
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,680
That's more advanced.

765
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Huh?

766
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
In the meantime, Hirate is...

767
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,520
trying to advance to the next step
on her own.

768
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,120
What's going on?

769
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,680
I want to get to the next step
as soon as possible.

770
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,480
She can't wait.

771
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,760
I get bored easily,
and I'm already bored.

772
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,320
Hirate will perform this "Hagoita."

773
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,600
Seven, eight...

774
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Female performers usually do
this trick on Hakata-koma's stage.

775
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,320
You need rhythm for this too.

776
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,480
This is it.

777
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,920
You look like you're miles away.

778
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,440
You just thought,
"This is what I have to do?"

779
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,560
I prefer not to know
what I'm doing beforehand.

780
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
I don't want to hear
all the instructions,

781
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,840
so I'll go,

782
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,760
listen and watch...

783
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,320
was what I was thinking,

784
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,960
but this was different
from what I expected.

785
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,200
It wasn't exactly what you expected.

786
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
The burden is tremendous, right?

787
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,040
If she never came on The Quest,

788
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,520
Hirate, Koma and Hagoita would have
never crossed each other's paths.

789
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,320
The Kusudama trick Uchimura is
going to attempt is called Mandou.

790
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,320
A top is placed on the palm,
then it's flipped.

791
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,040
It is put sideways,

792
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,400
- and thrown onto the string.
- Amazing.

793
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,360
Several steps are involved,

794
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,280
one little mistake
and it all goes down the pan.

795
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,560
It's a difficult trick.

796
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,040
- Like so?
- Yes.

797
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,760
There.

798
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
Wrap it. That's it.

799
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000
He wants to spin the top,
but he's kept busy chasing after it.

800
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,800
Meanwhile, Hirate is...

801
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,920
She's doing it.

802
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
She advanced significantly
while our attention was diverted.

803
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
- She's good.
- She's good.

804
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,640
With Uchimura, the most difficult
part is to tilt the top sideways.

805
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,840
This part is difficult.

806
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,600
If you get it around
your index finger...

807
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,320
- then it won't fall, so you're set.
- It's spinning.

808
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,600
Unless it's completely sideways,
it won't catch the string.

809
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,920
That was close.

810
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,360
When you have it around your finger,
wait. Please wait.

811
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,960
- That's too soon!
- Too soon. That's too soon.

812
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
No matter how many times he tries,
he doesn't succeed,

813
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,200
but he's been smiling
the whole time.

814
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,360
Today is a special-- Oh?

815
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,840
Yurina is cheering him on.

816
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,960
Huh? Was the dance like that?

817
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,960
No...

818
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,800
It was super lame just now.

819
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,640
Can you edit it out?

820
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,760
It was so lame.

821
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
That genius dancer is...

822
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,000
Her cheer gave him power.

823
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,280
That's it!

824
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,880
Everything is prepared
for the final performance.

825
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,880
Since I had this opportunity
to appear with Yurina,

826
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,400
I want to make it happen...

827
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,600
so it turns into a great finale.

828
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,360
I never thought I'd be doing
any performing today.

829
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,760
I thought I was just here
as a supporting role.

830
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,440
I'm actually nervous,
like I'm doing a live concert.

831
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,840
- This is so much pressure.
- Pressure?

832
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
Now, the party tricks performance.

833
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
- Now, the party tricks performance.
- Here it is!

834
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,080
We ask you to watch
Chikuzen Hakata-koma.

835
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,560
It's a traditional act
where this spinning top...

836
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,720
is spun on places such as the hand,
and a string.

837
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,560
There may be less on the programme
than you expected,

838
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
but we won't accept any complaints.

839
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,120
We won't accept them.

840
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,920
Let's get started.

841
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,640
First up is spinning top
on the hand.

842
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,200
It's an act where a spinning top
is placed on the hand.

843
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,200
She's good.

844
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,400
It barely got on.

845
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,160
You were panicking a bit.

846
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,720
Congratulations. Congratulations.

847
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,080
It's spinning more than usual.

848
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,840
Congratulations.

849
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,080
Happy New Year.

850
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm barely managing it.

851
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,120
I'm barely managing it too.

852
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,960
It's holding on.

853
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,880
It's holding on.

854
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,120
That!

855
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,720
I'm holding on too.

856
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,920
This is how much we've improved.

857
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,200
Next up is "Hagoita."

858
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,040
It will be performed
by Yurina Hirate.

859
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,600
She had no idea she would be
performing today until she got here.

860
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,640
- She's good!
- She's doing it.

861
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
- Amazing!
- Amazing.

862
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,400
Once she's on stage,
her performance is magnificent.

863
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,640
She's good.

864
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,000
That's nice.

865
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,160
- It looks like it's on pause.
- She's good.

866
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
That's pretty.

867
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
Amazing.

868
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,680
It's on.

869
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,520
Yoh!

870
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,560
- Amazing.
- That was perfect.

871
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,720
That was Yurina Hirate,

872
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
performing "Hagoita."

873
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,320
The last stunt is a powerful one.
Splitting kusudama, Mandou.

874
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,760
The kusudama is set at 3.5 metres.

875
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
He will split it open
for a gorgeous finale.

876
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,520
Go for it!

877
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,440
Now...

878
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,960
His special trick,
spinning with one hand.

879
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,640
It's a new trick not passed down
by the Chikuji clan.

880
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Now, he'll spin it with both hands
to increase its speed.

881
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,040
I see.

882
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,320
Now, it will be placed on his palm.

883
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,840
He's done an excellent job
up to this step.

884
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,600
- Looking good.
- It's incredible.

885
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,920
- It went!
- Go! Go!

886
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,440
The top didn't have enough momentum,
and it slowed down.

887
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,040
How disappointing
since it was perfect up to here.

888
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,120
My apologies.

889
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,720
Please allow me to lower it
by a little bit.

890
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,360
- He's lowering that?
- Right there.

891
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,400
Yes.

892
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,080
Uchimura was determined
from the beginning...

893
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,360
that he would challenge it as many
times as it took until he succeeded.

894
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,000
That was close.

895
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,720
That was close.

896
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,080
From this point onwards...

897
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,400
he failed...

898
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
15 times consecutively.

899
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,480
Oops.

900
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,960
I'm sorry.

901
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
Oppressive vibes
are felt on the scene.

902
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,480
They are all watching.

903
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
No one can say a word to Uchimura.

904
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,720
The one suffering the most...

905
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,960
is Yurina, who's been holding
the kusudama for over an hour.

906
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,520
You neglected her like never before.

907
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,160
For real?

908
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,680
I'm truly sorry. I'm neglecting
a person I admire so much.

909
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,560
This is his 23rd attempt.

910
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,280
Go for it.

911
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,800
So, momentum is critical.

912
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,000
Exactly.

913
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,080
We want it to be a success
for Yurina's sake as well.

914
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,320
Oh?

915
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,600
- Go for it!
- It went up! Go!

916
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,160
- This time for sure...
- Go up! Go up!

917
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,120
Go up!

918
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,400
I don't think it will ever
reach up there.

919
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,960
Yurina...

920
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,960
Yes.

921
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,160
- Lower it.
- Yes.

922
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,560
- Lower it.
- Yes.

923
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,160
- Lower it. Lower it. Lower it.
- Yes.

924
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,360
- There!
- Yes.

925
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,480
Now it'd be easier just to throw
the top at the kusudama!

926
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,600
Then, two hours after it started...

927
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,280
He's got it.

928
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,200
- It's looking good!
- It went up!

929
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,600
Yoh!

930
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
Yoh!

931
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,640
We wish for your year to be blessed.

932
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,400
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

933
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,600
Chikuzen Hakata-koma, Mandou.
He managed to make it happen.

934
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,400
We can finally go home.

935
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,160
That last one was beautifully done.

936
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,200
The way you put it on. It was
beautifully done. It stirred me.

937
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm glad.

938
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,080
Geez... This is too much.

939
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,080
I don't like party tricks.

940
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,920
I don't like them!

941
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,640
That's it for New Year's party trick
acquisition tour.

942
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,480
- Amazing.
- Yurina, what did you think?

943
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,840
The simplest thing of spinning it...

944
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,960
- was the hardest trick.
- That's the hardest.

945
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,640
Spinning it fast.

946
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,520
The most basic thing
is the hardest of it all.

947
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,280
Honestly, there are no issues
with your party tricks. You tried.

948
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,640
It was just that useless dialogue
between you two.

949
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,760
After you get this segment...

950
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,080
We watch the edited version
at the studio.

951
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,600
And his tone of voice?

952
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,640
What? Do you have
a problem with that?

953
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,280
Is there a problem speaking facts?

954
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,160
I have to say a typical person's
night out would be more exciting.

955
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,960
That was at quite a low level...

956
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,920
By the end, it was as high as
the lights in a Japanese style room.

957
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
- Seriously.
- That's funny.

958
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,080
It was like those low lights
at my parent's house.

959
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,920
When the kusudama broke,
Uchimura totally disappeared in it.

960
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,960
Well, then you go and try it!

961
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,960
In one day too!
