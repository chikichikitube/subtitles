00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,680
"The Quest".

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,520
The first part of this episode is...

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,480
Miyagawa Expedition,
the 14th edition.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,120
This time, you'll explore Amami
Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Amami Islands?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,720
Like Amami Oshima?

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,160
Amami Islands are located between
the mainland of Kyushu and Okinawa.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,880
They have a subtropical climate,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
and are home to rare plants
and animals,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,840
including endemic species.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,760
It's an unexplored region
with its own ecosystem.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,720
There are two things
that we want to find.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
To find the legendary endangered
animal, the Amami rabbit.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,280
I've heard of them.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,080
But I've, of course, never seen
them, because they're legendary.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,520
Another one is a mysterious cave
in the depth of the earth.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,440
You love caves, don't you?

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,640
We went to a cave before, didn't we?

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,520
The golden cave in Thailand.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
It was grey.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,520
You told me we'd no longer
visit caves.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,920
In the back of the cave, there are
stalactites on terraced fields.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
Terraced fields? Are you sure?

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm a bit worried.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,080
This time, we'll visit two islands
of Amami Islands,

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,640
and capture Amami rabbit
and the mysterious cave on camera.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,880
A new member wants to join
this expedition.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,280
Here I am.

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,520
It's Okasan.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,560
It's Assistant Director Hirata,
also known as Okasan.

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,360
Who first started
calling you Okasan?

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,240
Mr Degawa was the first one
who called me by that name.

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,720
That's how it started.

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
What do you think of that?

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,520
I feel honoured.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
You feel honoured?

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,040
What was your very first nickname?

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,840
Himiko.

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,160
That's a crazy first nickname.

41
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
Himiko? Were you a leader?

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,520
What kind of an adventure
will they have?

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,520
In addition to that,
we'll have Miyazon's helicopter trip

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
to see autumn leaves.

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,440
It's breathtaking.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,440
"This program was broadcast
15th November, 2020"

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,960
The Quest has begun.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,160
Tonight, we have Miyagawa's
14th expedition.

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,560
We'll also have "Go to the End
of the World and Stay There."

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,440
Yes!

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,040
First of all, Miyagawa, you went
to Amami Islands, Kagoshima.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,480
This time, with Okasan.

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,840
Her actual name is Hirata.

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,160
I wasn't sure if she liked
the nickname, so I asked her.

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,400
She said people also called her
Okasan at her previous job.

57
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,440
So I thought she didn't mind it,
and kept calling her Okasan.

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,720
Daisuke now calls her "Okkasan."

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Behind his back, she told me she
didn't like to be called "Okkasan."

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,280
- She hates that.
- But Okasan is okay.

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,320
- Just not "Okkasan."
- Yeah, she doesn't like "Okkasan."

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,160
Why is that?

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,640
I see it.

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
It's over there.

65
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,520
"Miyagawa's expedition
in Amami Islands"

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,920
This place is incredible!

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
Wow, look at that.

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,480
It's pretty.

69
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,240
What a great view.

70
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,560
"Miyazon's autumn leaves tour"

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
It's incredible.

72
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,520
A great adventure is about to start.

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,040
Miyagawa Expedition

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,280
in Amami Islands,
Kagoshima Prefecture.

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,440
Miyagawa Expedition.

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,200
When you watch it,
you can tell it's the real deal.

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
It's our 14th expedition, and we're
visiting Amami Islands, Kagoshima!

78
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,240
First, they explore Amami Oshima,
the biggest island of Amami Islands.

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,280
Here are the four members
of the expedition.

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,600
Director Kitami,
also known as Chappu.

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,840
Assistant producer Yoshizawa,

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
and Assistant Director Iwashita.

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,240
Also...

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
Hirata.

85
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,160
Also known as Okasan.

86
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
People often call me so.

87
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,520
Yeah, I know that.

88
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,040
What are you wearing?

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
You intentionally
try to look like a mother.

90
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,200
But you're well prepared.

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,720
I like that about you!

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,440
You're trying to make people laugh.

93
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
That helps me a lot.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,600
- It helps.
- Nice.

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,400
The first mission is

96
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,720
to capture the legendary and rare
Amami rabbit on camera.

97
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,720
Nature guide Masahiro Nishi
will assist in the expedition.

98
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,640
As an animal, Amami rabbit made
the first natural monument in Japan.

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,840
They're a special natural monument,
which is the highest rank.

100
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,760
The same species existed
in Mainland China before.

101
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,440
But when Amami Islands got separated
from Mainland China,

102
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,240
that species went extinct
in Mainland China.

103
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,280
Now, they only exist in Amami Oshima
and Tokunoshima.

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm curious.

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,880
I see something written
on your left hand. What is it?

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,760
I had to tell the district leader
that we'd be filming here today.

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
I wrote down, "district leader."

108
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
I thought I'd forget it otherwise.

109
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,480
Like an elementary school kid.

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
That's all.

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,720
About two million years ago,
due to tectonic shifting,

112
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
the islands got separated
from Mainland China.

113
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,000
Ever since then, the islands
kept their own ecosystem.

114
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,120
It's a place filled with rare
animals, including Amami rabbits.

115
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,480
But most of the animals
are nocturnal.

116
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,240
So during the day...

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,840
If you find something that looks
like food, please let me know.

118
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,560
they'll look for food
in Amami's forest and sea.

119
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,800
Can we eat this?

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,720
Leader!

121
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,280
You scared me!

122
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,600
What is it?

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
Look at this.

124
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,360
Behind the leaves.

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,320
What are they?

126
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,280
What are they? They look creepy!

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,720
They're stink bugs.

128
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,520
"Stink bugs gathered in one place"

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
That looks creepy!

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
They basically don't move at all
when it's hot during summer.

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,640
- They gather in one place and rest.
- No way.

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
Since you have that camera...

133
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,160
I'll shoot them up close.

134
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Could you also do the narration?

135
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,040
Since the last expedition,
the young director Kitami started

136
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,520
training himself
to do impromptu narration.

137
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,520
It's been one month now.
How much did he improve?

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
- Let's see.
- I have an idea.

139
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
Okay, go ahead.

140
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,800
A large amount of stink bugs gather
in a cool place during summer.

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,000
The way they stick
to the backs of the leaves

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
resembles ripe grapes.

143
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,520
You can tell yourself.

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Here, Leader finds food.

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,200
Wow, what is this?

146
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,160
They're snake gourds.

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,400
Snake gourds.

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,920
It's a plant in the gourd family.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,480
But they bear fruit four metres
above the ground.

150
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,760
It's not easy to reach them.

151
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
- I came up with a strategy.
- Okay.

152
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,280
Kitami and Leader,
please hold each other's shoulders.

153
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,320
I'll go on top of you guys,

154
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
and drop the gourds with a branch.

155
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,840
That's my strategy.

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll go up.

157
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,960
That's how it should be.

158
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,440
How much do you weigh?

159
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,200
Sixty-seven kilograms.

160
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,320
Eighty kilograms.

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,600
Seventy-eight kilograms.

162
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,560
So it's you.

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,280
Let's get it started!

164
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,680
- Slowly.
- Here it goes.

165
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,280
Ouch, don't pull my hair.

166
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,920
- Don't pull my hair.
- I'm falling!

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,720
I'm falling!

168
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,320
Watch out!

169
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,240
Leader was hit strongly on his nose.

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,840
That hurt.

171
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,960
You went down this way.

172
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,560
This part dropped.

173
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,280
This strategy won't work.

174
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
Next, they decided to make a loop
with their rope,

175
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,720
and try to hook the fruit with it.

176
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
- I'm scared.
- It's fine.

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,480
Okasan will give it a try.

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
Below her is Iwashita.

179
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Here we go.

180
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,240
"Iwashita's quiet battle begins now"

181
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,400
Iwashita's quiet battle begins now.

182
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Step forward a bit, Iwashita.

183
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,480
Forward.

184
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,960
It's an important job.

185
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,440
You can do it!

186
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,600
You can do it!

187
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
Almost there. Once again.

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Keep going, Iwashita.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,960
Okay, nice. You go it.

190
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,080
- Wait, wait.
- Hold it, hold it.

191
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,840
Now, all they need to do
is to pull the rope.

192
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,080
Okay, here we go.

193
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,400
We've got it! We got two of them!

194
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,360
After going through trouble,
they've got two snake gourds!

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,800
However...

196
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,120
What is this?

197
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
It stinks.

198
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,840
They were too ripe to be eaten.

199
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,040
Next, they find Amami
short-horned grasshoppers,

200
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
which is in the same family
as rice grasshopper.

201
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,280
Can you capture it?
This is our only chance.

202
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,920
So quick.

203
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,480
The grasshoppers that they captured

204
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,640
will be boiled and seasoned
with Japanese silver leaf,

205
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,200
which is an Asteraceae plant
growing on the island.

206
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,320
We're at the sea!

207
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Next, they'll try to find seafood.

208
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,200
Flip over large rocks like that.

209
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,120
If you dig ground underneath it,

210
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,080
you might be able to find
large mud crabs.

211
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,880
They're large crabs that are
more than 20 centimetres long.

212
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,680
Give me a shovel.

213
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
Shovel.

214
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

215
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,240
"The Ant and the Grasshopper.

216
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,400
The sun is burning the fields
and forests.

217
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
It's hot..."

218
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,000
It was quick today.

219
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
The baby's asleep.

220
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Are you asleep?

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,040
Good night. You idiot!

222
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,720
This is "Aesop's Fable."

223
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
I meant "shovel".

224
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Why did you hand me "Aesop's Fable"?

225
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,280
Oh, yeah, that's right.

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
I like thin ones rather than
thick ones. This one is thick.

227
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,400
Let's eat.

228
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,640
I love sukonbu. You idiot!

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
This is sukonbu.

230
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,600
I panicked a bit
when you handed this to me.

231
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,920
I told you to give me a shovel,
and you gave me this.

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
I panicked quite a bit.

233
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,280
I was really anxious. You idiot.

234
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,760
This isn't the right one.
I need a shovel.

235
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you know what this is?

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Does he know what it is?

237
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,840
That's right, this is it.

238
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,280
This is it.

239
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
This...

240
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah, I know what this is.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,120
Woohoo...

242
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Woohoo...

243
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
What?

244
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,320
Woohoo...

245
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,000
What is this?

246
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,840
- Sawadee kap.
- Sawadee kap!

247
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,280
Sawadee kap!

248
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
How would he know?

249
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,800
How would I know that?

250
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,120
Let's get back to mud crabs.

251
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Oh, look!

252
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
That's not it.

253
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,520
That's not it!

254
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,360
I caught two animals.
Are they edible?

255
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
No, they aren't.

256
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,960
Unfortunately,
they couldn't find mud crabs.

257
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,600
But in the river...

258
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,200
I've got it.

259
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,640
He's good.

260
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,880
He found freshwater prawn, which is
a speciality of Amami Oshima.

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,200
I'm so happy.

262
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,480
With everyone joining forces,
they caught this many prawns.

263
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,640
They also found something perfect
for dessert.

264
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,880
- Bananas.
- They're bananas.

265
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,480
They are musa acuminata, which is
in the same family as bananas.

266
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,280
- With these...
- Will they grill them?

267
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
Try it, Yoshizawa.

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920
Yoshizawa, who is the biggest fruit
lover in the team, will try it.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
She's a fruit lover?

270
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,640
With the skin removed,
it looks just like a banana.

271
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,640
Banana.

272
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
She looks serious.

273
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,840
"Crunch, crunch"

274
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,560
It doesn't sound like
you're eating a banana.

275
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,200
It sounds crunchy.

276
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,920
I don't approve of this taste.

277
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,440
That's terrible.

278
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,720
- We can't eat it.
- You can try it on this end.

279
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Sure.

280
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,560
I'll try it.

281
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,600
You spat it out.

282
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,720
Again!

283
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,120
Here are the foods from Amami
that they found.

284
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Our guide Nishi
caught a lot of grasshoppers.

285
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,000
They simmer and season them
with Japanese silver leaves.

286
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,840
Freshwater prawns
are steamed simply.

287
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,880
That looks great.

288
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm getting hungry.

289
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Okasan makes salted riceballs
for everyone.

290
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,680
Very nice.

291
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,280
This will give them energy
for the night safari.

292
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll try this. What is this?

293
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Mecopoda elongata.

294
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,560
That's good.

295
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,520
Really? This kind is good?

296
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
How does it taste?

297
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,000
It's good!

298
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,520
"Good!"

299
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
It tastes like river shrimp.

300
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,240
Here's freshwater prawn.

301
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,440
- It's very good.
- It sure is.

302
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,840
Okasan's salted riceballs
are also incredible.

303
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
- It's great!
- Right?

304
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
It has the perfect amount of salt,
Okasan.

305
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,200
There's an extra-large one.

306
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,320
It's huge.

307
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,240
"Extra-large grasshopper"

308
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,520
This is an adult female
Asian long-headed locust.

309
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,520
That's good!

310
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,400
Go for it.

311
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,760
It tastes good.

312
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
Right?

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
But its jagged legs
stick in his throat.

314
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,840
"Woof"

315
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,720
It's 7:00 pm.

316
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,280
It's time for nocturnal animals
to start moving.

317
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,720
Please look at this.

318
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,440
There. Amazing.

319
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,560
He looks dignified.

320
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,120
What is it?

321
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
It's an Amami tip-nosed frog.

322
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,080
They are endemic to the Amami,
and a natural monument.

323
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,320
At night, it's easy to find bugs
on the street which they feed on.

324
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,760
So we'll walk on forest paths
like this.

325
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,800
Amami rabbits also come down
forest paths at night to eat grass.

326
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,800
However, they're a very
sensitive animal,

327
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,200
and they hide in a bush if they
sense the presence of humans.

328
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,240
How likely will we able to see them?

329
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,880
When you explore this island,

330
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,640
there's about 30 per cent chance

331
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,160
that you'll be able
to see the rabbit.

332
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,760
Then...

333
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,280
I see something.

334
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,200
Look.

335
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,560
It's over there.

336
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,440
That's Amami woodcock.

337
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,760
They're an epidemic species
of Amami Islands.

338
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,720
For a moment,
I thought it was the rabbit.

339
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,760
- I thought so, too.
- Me too.

340
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,920
But right after that...

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I heard something.

342
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
This is it?

343
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,560
It's the sound they make.

344
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,760
Amami rabbits make this kind of
squeaky sound.

345
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,000
On top of that...

346
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,760
Wow, that's a lot.

347
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,560
On the forest path,
there's a lot of rabbit faeces.

348
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,680
"Amami rabbit's faeces"

349
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,520
It's a sign that they're nearby.

350
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
Right then...

351
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,560
There's one.

352
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,520
- There's one.
- There's one.

353
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,880
- Can I cast light on it?
- Yeah.

354
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,240
A rabbit appears from the darkness.

355
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,400
This is our country's natural
monument, the Amami rabbit.

356
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Awesome.

357
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,080
It's facing its bottom
to the camera, and eating grass.

358
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,520
Amami rabbit.
It's bigger than I expected.

359
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,640
They're about 50 centimetres long.

360
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,640
They're that big?

361
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
The rabbit has small ears,

362
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,760
and has short legs,

363
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,120
features which have not changed
since ancient times.

364
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
They're often called
a living fossil.

365
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,520
- That's quite rare.
- Wait a minute.

366
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,200
Here it goes.

367
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,960
- It's leaving.
- It's hopping.

368
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,040
It's gone.

369
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,040
We could only see it
for just one minute.

370
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,040
Did you get it?

371
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes, we did.

372
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,840
They successfully captured
the endangered animal on camera.

373
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,840
Impressive.

374
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,120
The second day of the adventure.

375
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,400
On this day, in the beautiful sea
of Amami Oshima,

376
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,640
they'll train their body and mind.

377
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,880
Taishi Otono, a coach of a water
rescue team, will assist them.

378
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,840
What will they do today?

379
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,640
We'll sink down
while holding a rock.

380
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,600
Sink down
while holding a rock, and...

381
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
And run.

382
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,360
- Run on the sea bottom?
- Yes.

383
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
Really?

384
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
They'll train to get their body
and mind in shape.

385
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,520
It's a rock training from hell.

386
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,320
We'll sink down
while holding a rock.

387
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,280
Sink down
while holding a rock, and...

388
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,200
And run.

389
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,080
- Run on the sea bottom?
- Yes.

390
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,480
Really?

391
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,200
They'll train to get their body
and mind in shape.

392
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,760
It's a rock training from hell.

393
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,160
But before that,
they'll warm up on the beach.

394
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,000
He swims nicely.

395
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,920
This is called "washing machine."

396
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,360
It's a training to stay calm
when the sea suddenly gets rough.

397
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
Breathe in.

398
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
We'll go backward now.

399
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,160
A large amount of sea water
comes into the nose.

400
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm totally fine.

401
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,120
Now that he's done the warmup,
he'll start the rock training.

402
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,120
First, Mr Otono will show them
how to do it.

403
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,240
A rock is placed three metres
deep into the sea.

404
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,840
The rock weighs about 30 kilograms.

405
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,400
"Weighs 30 kilograms"

406
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,120
- What?
- He's running!

407
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
It's crazier than I expected!

408
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Wow.

409
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,520
Seriously?

410
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,880
He runs 20 metres total
without breathing.

411
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,720
He finishes running easily.

412
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
- It's so cool.
- I can never do this.

413
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,520
Impressive!

414
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,760
That was incredibly cool.

415
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Let's try it.

416
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,000
Chappu?

417
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,960
The first one to go is Kitami, who
is quite chubby for a 32-year-old.

418
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,800
Good luck.

419
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,240
Diving itself is hard.

420
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Good luck.

421
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,440
Oh, no.

422
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,040
He manages to reach the rock.

423
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,360
Then...

424
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,600
You can do it!

425
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,080
He panics after two steps.

426
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,040
How was it?

427
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,640
It was already close to my limit
when I reached the sea bottom.

428
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,280
But you took two steps.

429
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,840
I could see that
you were determined.

430
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,200
Next is Leader.

431
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
So fast.

432
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,000
He holds the rock firmly.

433
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,320
Now, how many steps can he take?

434
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,040
- Impressive.
- Impressive.

435
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
Impressive!

436
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,520
Leader takes light steps
on the sea bottom,

437
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,640
and quickly reaches
the half-way point.

438
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,720
He's leaning forward to have
the centre of gravity in front,

439
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
and runs as if he's flying.

440
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Impressive.

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
Nice.

442
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,400
It's his first try, and he finishes
running 20 metres!

443
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm very happy!

444
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
I'm very happy!

445
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,840
Next is an underwater backflip.

446
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,360
A backflip?

447
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,640
Bring the rock above yourself
and do a backflip.

448
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,120
It's a difficult trick, but Leader
impresses everyone again.

449
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,920
With the rock's weight?

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,760
Exactly.

451
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Impressive.

452
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,560
He succeeds at first try.

453
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,200
I did it!

454
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
I did a backflip!

455
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,000
Next is Iwashita, who ranked ninth
at a national swimming competition.

456
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,560
The way he swims is different.

457
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,000
He does a backflip
with a great form.

458
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,320
And the second time.

459
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
He continues!

460
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,720
Nice.

461
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,960
Impressive!

462
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Incredible!

463
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,160
He did three backflips, which even
Mr Otono wasn't expecting.

464
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,760
I did one flip, he did three,

465
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,880
so, Chappu, you do five flips.

466
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Can Kitami prove that he can do it?

467
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,760
Go!

468
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,280
- Go for it!
- The way he swims...

469
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,240
Good luck!

470
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
You can do it!

471
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Good luck!

472
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,400
Great!

473
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,040
- Go!
- More.

474
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,480
He did succeed.

475
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,320
You did it.

476
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,960
It looked terrible, but...

477
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,080
you did it!

478
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,880
Their training continues.

479
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,320
Wow, look at that!

480
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
Incredible!

481
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,280
This waterfall is 30 metres high.

482
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
It's called Shinoho Waterfalls,
and the water falls to the beach.

483
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,560
Look at this.

484
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,440
This power.

485
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,160
Lie on your back!

486
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
This will train your mind.

487
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,120
Here we go.

488
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,480
It's a tough training
that can only be done

489
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,640
at a waterfall without a basin.

490
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
It looks tough!

491
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,520
This must be hard.

492
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,760
Leader!

493
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,880
Leader!

494
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,160
This is crazy!

495
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,720
Seriously!

496
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,760
Water pressure is so strong.

497
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,000
By enduring the strong impact
on their entire body,

498
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,920
they train their body and mind.

499
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,640
Chappu? Are you serious?

500
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,920
Seriously?

501
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,200
He goes to rescue him right away.

502
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,800
Pull him out, Iwashita.

503
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,440
After the training,

504
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,960
the members of the expedition
are now united even more strongly.

505
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,880
Tomorrow, they'll visit
the underground cave,

506
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
which will be quite tough.

507
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,120
Here comes the last day.

508
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
From Amami Oshima,
they go to Okinoerabujima,

509
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,040
which is where the cave is.

510
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,360
It's an island with a circumference
of 50 kilometres,

511
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,280
and there are 300 large
and small caves on the island.

512
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,560
The island has attracted many people
in recent years,

513
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,360
as the holy ground of caving.

514
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,520
Our guides, Arikawa and Daido,
will show our team the way.

515
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
About the cave
we are going to today,

516
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,400
for people who want to go caving
on Okinoerabujima,

517
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,560
we offer the basic course.

518
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,200
Only people who finished the basic
course can go to this cave.

519
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,520
You all haven't done
the basic course,

520
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
and you will be doing
something very advanced.

521
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,040
You'll need to do this
with a strong determination.

522
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Please wait.

523
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,320
What should we do?

524
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,960
I think we can do it.

525
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,080
Thank you.

526
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,240
Chappu?

527
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,520
- We can do it for sure.
- You should wait.

528
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,480
You'll drag us down, guaranteed.

529
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,840
A terrifying underground cave
where their screams echo!

530
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,560
It's a cave called Ginsuido,
which is beneath this jungle.

531
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,560
It's a tough road to get there,

532
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
but when they reach the place,

533
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,160
there will be beautiful
terraced stalactites.

534
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,080
The small hole you can see over
there is the entrance of Ginsuido.

535
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,280
- What?
- What?

536
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,000
It looks creepy.

537
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,760
The entrance is already difficult
to get past.

538
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,800
It's already very tight.
What is this?

539
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,680
It looks crazy.

540
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,600
They crawl on all fours
for 20 metres in a river.

541
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,520
I've never done this before.

542
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,560
Crawling itself is quite hard.

543
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,320
But on top of that, rocks on the
ground cut their palms and knees.

544
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,880
Chappu and Okasan,
are you two all right?

545
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,120
- Okasan is in there.
- Yes.

546
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,520
We're fine.

547
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,960
It's a tough route that has not
been maintained at all.

548
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,360
They move forward carefully.

549
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,000
- It's a coral fossil.
- Here it is.

550
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,280
This is it.

551
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,560
This island was underwater before,
and corals grew there.

552
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Okinoerabujima is an island formed
by the uplift of a coral reef.

553
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,440
Therefore, the ground is fragile,

554
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,600
and numerous caves have been formed
by groundwater erosion.

555
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,280
This part looks crazy.

556
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,760
They pass an area
with a low ceiling again.

557
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,920
They crawl in water.

558
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,640
We should take a break.

559
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,200
Let's cool down.

560
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,160
Wait.

561
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,480
Chappu, Okasan,
you look like you're at the beach.

562
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,600
You look like a married couple
watching kids playing in water.

563
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,840
Here comes the hardest part
of the cave.

564
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,200
This tiny hole is the only way
to get past this area.

565
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
This continues?

566
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,920
Yes, it continues to the back.

567
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,920
It's the hardest part.

568
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is crazy.

569
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,880
I barely fit in this.

570
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,240
It's only 20 centimetres from
the ceiling to the water surface.

571
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,800
This place is insane!

572
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,320
They move forward slowly
while facing up.

573
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Wow.

574
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,640
It's dangerous when people panic,
so they all try to keep calm.

575
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,480
All of the members successfully pass
the hardest part of the cave.

576
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,840
Now, they're halfway there.

577
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,880
From here on, the cave starts
to look completely different.

578
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
What is this?

579
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,640
It's a beautiful world
of stalactites.

580
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
They're spirals.

581
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,640
Spirals.

582
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,040
They're spiralling
stalactite icicles called spirals.

583
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,040
Water drips quicker than the others.

584
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,960
I see.

585
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,560
- The shapes change based on that.
- Interesting.

586
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,480
This looks pretty.

587
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,160
Calcium carbonate crystals
in stalactites sparkle.

588
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,720
It's rare to see particles this big.

589
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,160
They sparkle a lot.

590
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
You're right.

591
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
It's been three hours
since they entered the cave.

592
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,920
Once they go down
this vertical waterfall,

593
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
the goal will be near.

594
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,960
We're almost there!

595
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,840
- Okay.
- Impressive.

596
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Next is Iwashita,
who has a fear of heights.

597
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
Look at your face.

598
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,560
Your face, Iwashita!

599
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,240
Relax! You look really tense.

600
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
And...

601
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Wow, it's so white.

602
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,520
This is the best viewpoint.

603
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,320
It's a completely different colour.
I've never seen it before.

604
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,040
I've never seen this before.

605
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,000
Glossy stalactites
in a pure white colour,

606
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,560
and completely transparent water.

607
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Incredible.

608
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,320
They will instal about
30 white lights in this area.

609
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,120
Here's the view.

610
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,800
I'll look now.

611
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,080
It's beautiful!

612
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,680
It's such a beautiful cave.

613
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,200
It's a series of terraced
stalactite pools,

614
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,640
which is 50 metres long
and 30 metres wide.

615
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,080
A mystical scenery that exists
underground of a tropical island.

616
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,920
These pools are so pretty!

617
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,240
- This is quite rare, isn't it?
- Yes.

618
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,200
They line up like a paillette,

619
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,880
and depending on the angle,

620
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,840
the water has a deep blue colour
or an emerald green colour.

621
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,400
On this day,
there was plenty of water,

622
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,720
and according to the guide,
it was the perfect condition.

623
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,720
That's great.

624
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,280
Chappu, Okasan, are you okay?

625
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,480
Yes.

626
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,920
Ginsuido was formed
over millions of years.

627
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,720
After a rough journey,
the expedition members

628
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,440
finally reached
the depths of the cave.

629
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,040
There, we saw water
illuminated by simple lights,

630
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,640
glowing in different colours.

631
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,520
It's a miraculous product!

632
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,440
Good job.

633
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,400
"Chappu has reached the next level"

634
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,280
Look forward to the next adventure
of the Miyagawa Expedition!

635
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,880
Was it not for our calendar?

636
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,440
This wasn't for our calendar.

637
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,560
- That was calendar material.
- Definitely!

638
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,800
It was the prettiest of all places
Daisuke had visited.

639
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,240
To be honest.

640
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,640
You should replace
the high diving with this.

641
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,280
"October"

642
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,920
Here's the next section!

643
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,080
Go to the End of the World
and Stay There!

644
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,640
Yes!

645
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,320
Miyazon, what did you do this time?

646
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,160
This time, I went to see
autumn leaves, which is perfect now.

647
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,720
Autumn leaves.

648
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,040
It wasn't just visiting a place
with great autumn leaves.

649
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,040
We actually rented a helicopter,

650
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,720
and went up north from Tokyo
to visit different places.

651
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
Really?

652
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,960
Was it a fun trip?

653
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,720
Fun trip? No.
It was a super fun trip!

654
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,160
I see.

655
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,000
The journey began in Tokyo Heliport
in Koto Ward, Tokyo.

656
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,880
Here I am at the heliport!

657
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,000
Autumn has finally arrived

658
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,760
Autumn leaves are the best part
Of autumn

659
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,520
Let's take a helicopter
To see autumn leaves

660
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,960
Helicopters are perfect for autumn

661
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,880
Autumn is perfect for helicopters

662
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,120
Helicopters are perfect
For helicopters

663
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Helicopters

664
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,200
Helicopters.

665
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,120
On this trip,
he'll take this helicopter

666
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,680
and visit different places in Japan
to see autumn leaves.

667
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,400
It looks so cool!

668
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,040
I've always wanted to go
on a helicopter since I was a child.

669
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm actually getting quite excited.

670
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,840
- You're doing well.
- Yes.

671
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,040
Let's go see the autumn leaves.

672
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,120
- That's great.
- Yes, I am surprised myself.

673
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,680
This time, we prepared a helicopter
dedicated to filming.

674
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,720
We'll shoot footage
that you would never see,

675
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,240
unless you're Superman.

676
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Rest assured.

677
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,240
Did you already start using tables
with heaters?

678
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,520
Stay warm and enjoy the show.

679
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,200
Now, the helicopter
autumn leaves tour begins!

680
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,280
They travel 700 kilometres north
from Tokyo

681
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,000
to Lake Towada, Aomori Prefecture.

682
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,680
I'll see you later.

683
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,480
Now, the helicopter
autumn leaves tour begins!

684
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,760
The first thing he sees is...

685
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,640
Wow, that's Tokyo Tower!

686
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,160
You don't get a lot of opportunities
to look down on Tokyo Tower.

687
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,000
Also on the left side,

688
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,800
I see Sky Tree.

689
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,480
On GoPro, it might appear small,
but with my naked eyes,

690
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,440
I can see it very close.

691
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,880
That's Nippon TV.

692
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,520
I went there earlier today.

693
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,960
Incredible.

694
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,440
I'm passing above Nippon TV.

695
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,440
I see.

696
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,400
Nippon TV is thinner than I thought.

697
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,600
After flying for 30 minutes,

698
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,800
the helicopter enters
Tochigi Prefecture.

699
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
Whoa, look!

700
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,400
I see Irohazaka.

701
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,960
It's curving.

702
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,600
It's beautiful.

703
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,360
The first autumn leaves stop is

704
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,520
Irohazaka in Nikko City,
Tochigi Prefecture.

705
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,960
During this season,
the place is crowded with drivers.

706
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,080
It's really a winding road.

707
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,040
This road connects Nikko City
to Okunikko.

708
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,520
There are 48 curves total,

709
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,960
and each curve is named after
the Japanese syllabary.

710
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,200
I'd love to go see it.

711
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,680
Let's go to Irohazaka.

712
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,080
- Yes!
- Awesome.

713
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I landed.

714
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,680
Thank you!

715
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,840
We'll use this kind of system
this time.

716
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,000
Iroha ni hoheto.

717
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,520
"It's Miyazon!"

718
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,680
The guide was the one
who called my name.

719
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,040
He said, "To your left is Miyazon."

720
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,400
He goes up to a viewing platform.

721
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,040
Could it be that we'll see
a great view with autumn leaves?

722
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
It's Kegon Waterfalls!

723
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,120
It's pretty!

724
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,840
Let's go closer to the waterfalls.

725
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,680
Wow!

726
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,000
- It's impressive.
- Anything can happen on this show.

727
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,440
I've never seen the waterfalls
from this angle.

728
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,760
Amazing.

729
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,200
Waterfalls!

730
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,840
And autumn leaves!

731
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,520
Kegon Waterfalls is considered one
of the three greatest waterfalls.

732
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,720
Water is falling
among autumn leaves.

733
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
Behind it,
Lake Chuzenji can be seen.

734
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,280
It looks impressive.

735
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,160
Especially from a helicopter.

736
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,960
The waterfall is very tall.

737
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,880
The helicopter starts heading
slightly east.

738
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,440
There's a massive thing.

739
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,960
What's that?

740
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,240
He sees a statue that sticks out
compared to buildings around it.

741
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,920
I already know what it is.

742
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
It's Buddha.

743
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,520
This is Ushiku Daibutsu
in Ushiku, Ibaraki Prefecture.

744
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,320
It's the tallest bronze statue
in the world,

745
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,720
which is 120 metres tall.

746
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,080
I saw the Statue of Liberty
in New York.

747
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,000
This is as impressive as that.

748
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,720
It's three times taller
than the Statue of Liberty.

749
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,480
Three times? I thought so.

750
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,360
This one seems more free.

751
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,480
Here!

752
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,080
Thank you!

753
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,120
Here I am.

754
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,120
Look at this. It's huge!

755
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
Miyazon actually loves
Buddha statues.

756
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,520
There are lotus flowers
at the bottom.

757
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,960
You often hear
about Hail Lotus Sutra.

758
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,200
Hail Lotus Sutra means,

759
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,840
"I believe in the training
of the lotus flowers."

760
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,360
To make flowers bloom out of mud.

761
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,480
That's what it's teaching us.

762
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,600
- We need to take off our shoes.
- Yes.

763
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,000
- Put them in a bag.
- Really?

764
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,560
These days, plastic bags
cost three to five yen.

765
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
- Is it free?
- It's included.

766
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Are you sure? Thank you.

767
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,480
This is the Buddha's toe.

768
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
This is the actual size. It's huge.

769
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
It's a toe in the actual size.

770
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,800
Just the nail is already
over one metre long.

771
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,080
There's a souvenir store.

772
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,040
- Nice.
- There...

773
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,200
I think I'll buy this.

774
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,200
Miyazon wants to get a miniature
Ushiku Daibutsu.

775
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,760
It's 4,300 yen.

776
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,160
Mr Yamamoto, do you want one?

777
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,360
Director Shirai?

778
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,080
I think I'll get three of them.

779
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,840
One for each.

780
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,280
As a gift?

781
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,840
They check the stock right away.

782
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,880
We have nine of them.

783
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,560
You have nine of them?

784
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,600
Should I buy them in bulk?

785
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,680
I'll take the entire box.

786
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,960
Thank you.

787
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,480
- Really?
- I'll take them.

788
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,120
I've never seen anyone
buy Buddha statues in bulk.

789
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,640
Thank you very much.

790
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll need a receipt
addressed to Miyazono.

791
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,720
The helicopter continues
heading east.

792
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,000
The Pacific Ocean comes into view.

793
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,840
What's that red thing
behind the ferris wheel?

794
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,000
What is that?

795
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,160
It looks like autumn leaves.

796
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,640
I've never seen anything so red.

797
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,680
What is that?

798
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,400
Hey, please don't push!

799
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Wow, look at this!

800
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,680
It looks incredible
on the ground, too!

801
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,800
He is visiting Hitachi Seaside Park.

802
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,400
There are fluffy ball-like plants
everywhere he sees.

803
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,000
They are also autumn leaves that
can only be seen during this season.

804
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,800
These are kokia plants!

805
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,760
They're usually green
and look like round green algae.

806
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,320
But during this season,

807
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,480
they change colours
and have a vivid red colour.

808
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,320
Here, Miyazon has a quiz
about kokia.

809
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,560
Once withered,
this plant turns into something.

810
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,040
What do you think it is?

811
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,160
- What is it?
- Mr Uchimura,

812
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,800
answer me within one second.

813
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,880
One second has already passed,
but you're fine.

814
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,280
Really? It's okay?

815
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,160
I'm sorry. Wrong!

816
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,680
Here's the answer.

817
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,040
I'm sorry.

818
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,800
- Here it is.
- What's going on?

819
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,040
Do you know what it is?

820
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
A broom.

821
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,880
Here it is.

822
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,120
It turns into a broom!

823
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,520
They're also known as broom plant.

824
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,440
In olden times,
they used this plant to make brooms.

825
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,920
Belvedere fruit,
which is also known as field caviar,

826
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
is actually processed kokia seeds.

827
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,640
I'll call this land coral leaf.

828
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,560
That sounds good.

829
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,240
Miyazon wants to find
a great metaphor for kokia.

830
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,280
But "land coral leaf" is...

831
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,400
Someone has already said it.

832
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,720
Okay, let's come up
with something else.

833
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,560
This one is very unique.

834
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,880
Land...

835
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
round red algae.

836
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
How about that?

837
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
Land round green algae.

838
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Round green algae...

839
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,240
- A lot has said that?
- Everyone.

840
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,920
Everyone calls it that.

841
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Can I have one last thing?

842
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,080
Land soccer ball.

843
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,720
Land soccer ball
is just a soccer ball.

844
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,000
That's right.

845
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,720
Miyazon finds that someone else has
a great talent in using metaphors.

846
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,680
What kind of metaphor would you use?

847
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,880
For example, oysters are often
called "milk of the sea".

848
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,160
A festive theatre of brooms.

849
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,320
He did better than me.

850
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,920
The goal in Aomori
is 550 kilometres away.

851
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,560
But here, he receives
unfortunate news.

852
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,520
We'll take a car from here.

853
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,880
What?

854
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,120
Not a helicopter?

855
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,560
It's because of our budget.

856
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,000
I see.

857
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm staying positive.

858
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,960
If I said, "What? Why?

859
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,760
Why can't I take a helicopter?"

860
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,160
Then I'd sound like
a Hollywood star.

861
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,000
So from here on,
they head north by car.

862
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,320
They head to Narukokyo, a famous
autumn leaves spot in Tohoku.

863
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,440
Now, take a look at their
spontaneous trip to Narukokyo.

864
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,200
First is a great gyoza shop
in Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture.

865
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,240
They have various kinds of gyoza,
and they're incredibly tasty.

866
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
But that wasn't it.

867
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,960
The shop owner was a folk singer,
and he started singing.

868
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,320
That's the last one, so please eat
while listening to my song.

869
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,600
It's the very last

870
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,880
gyoza

871
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
It makes it hard to eat.

872
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,240
A lodge in Tochigi Prefecture
that takes forever to check in.

873
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,720
What?

874
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,880
Are we in Egypt?

875
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,240
Is this a pyramid?

876
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,680
This place is called
Pyramid Genki Onsen.

877
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Welcome.

878
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920
Thank you.

879
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,880
- Nice to meet you.
- I like stuff like this.

880
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,280
I'd like to stay
at this inn tonight.

881
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,280
Sure, no problem.

882
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,720
I hear "Fur Elise" playing.

883
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,880
Why did you build a pyramid?

884
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,720
It's because of the energy
of the universe.

885
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,200
- Okay.
- Well,

886
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
- it's a long time ago, but
- Okay.

887
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,720
we had this thing
called Pyramid Power.

888
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,880
We gathered the energy here,

889
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,800
and concentrated it to one point.

890
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,200
We then put it in our bath.

891
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,520
That's what we did.

892
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,480
Sorry, I couldn't hear anything
because of "Fur Elise".

893
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,800
Thank you.

894
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
I'll go in.

895
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,840
When he thought
he could finally check in...

896
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,960
That light there and this...

897
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,880
He starts to talk
about the facility.

898
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,640
I couldn't say no to him
because I knew he meant well.

899
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,880
It lasted for about 30 minutes.

900
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,080
He told me about different things.

901
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,920
If you lay down here,
you'll be asleep within 10 minutes.

902
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,920
How is it?

903
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,360
You'll get sleepy.

904
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,200
No matter what you're thinking,

905
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,320
it's okay,
because you'll get sleepy.

906
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,920
Can I check in now?

907
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,600
Sure.

908
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,480
Charred roasted pork
in Fukushima Prefecture.

909
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,000
It looks pretty!

910
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,240
Shirakawa Ramen

911
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,720
is a local speciality
of Shirakawa City, Fukushima.

912
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,200
- This looks great.
- It was great.

913
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,120
How nice.

914
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,560
It's incredible.

915
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,800
The noodles are great.

916
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,080
Their roasted pork is also good.

917
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,920
It's a bit charred...

918
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,080
How should I put it?
It has a good aroma.

919
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,080
No, it's just burnt.

920
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,120
Really?

921
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,440
Cameraman Yamamoto's routine.

922
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,800
Here's Yamamoto.

923
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,280
- Is he studying something?
- He's taking medicine.

924
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,240
What kind of medicine do you take?

925
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,560
For my blood pressure,

926
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,760
- cholesterol,
- I'm worried about him.

927
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,400
- blood pressure,
- You're kidding.

928
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,280
- uric acid level,
- Don't go on a trip then.

929
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,040
- allergy.
- It's hard to live.

930
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,040
Tsuruga Castle in Fukushima that
didn't have autumn leaves at all.

931
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,840
Is this it?
Illuminated autumn leaves.

932
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,800
This?

933
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,760
How did this happen?

934
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,680
He is the reason.

935
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,640
I'm Hoshi from the tourism division
of the city.

936
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,920
Mr Yuto Hoshi.

937
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,040
Leaves are just starting
to change colours.

938
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,240
You came here a bit too early.

939
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,800
We were talking about
painting the leaves.

940
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,480
Why didn't you tell me?

941
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,800
Because you wouldn't have come
if we told you.

942
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Kaleidoscope Museum in Miyagi
that they visited unannounced.

943
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,840
Did you see that?

944
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,440
It says kaleidoscope. It's a museum.

945
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,800
I want to go
because I like sparkly things.

946
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,440
He calls them right away.

947
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,720
I bought that at a roadside station.

948
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Thank you for calling,
this is Kaleidoscope Museum.

949
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,000
Hi there, my name is Miyazono.

950
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm filming a show called
"The Quest".

951
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,400
- Okay.
- We're on a filming trip right now.

952
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Okay.

953
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,480
We'd love to stop by at your museum.

954
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,640
When do you plan to visit?

955
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,800
Actually, we're already in front
of the museum entrance.

956
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
What?

957
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,440
The most popular part of the museum
is a kaleidoscope

958
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,960
into which you stick your head in,
perfect for Instagram.

959
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,600
It's pretty.

960
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,840
It feels like I'm inside
of a piece of jewel.

961
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,640
- This looks nice.
- It reminds me of my childhood.

962
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,560
My family was so poor

963
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,440
and we didn't have toys.

964
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,280
So we'd get cardboard boxes
from a vegetable shop nearby.

965
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,040
I'd stick my head
in a cardboard box like this.

966
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,520
It was a way for me
to be in my own world.

967
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,880
This reminds me of those times.

968
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
After three whole days,

969
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,120
Miyazon arrives
at Narukokyo, Miyagi Prefecture.

970
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,280
- Wow!
- Everything is so short.

971
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,440
What a great view.

972
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,480
Incredible!

973
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,720
Natukokyo, Miyagi Prefecture.

974
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,560
Sheer cliffs up to 100 metres deep
are covered in autumn leaves.

975
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,560
The white bridge over here

976
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,040
brings all the colours together.

977
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,080
- That's true.
- So pretty.

978
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,640
When you see it, you understand

979
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,200
that those pine trees
are working very well.

980
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,200
They have a deep green colour, which
looks great against other colours.

981
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,640
That's why we get these colours.
I see.

982
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,920
Narukokyo.

983
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
"Kyo" in Narukokyo
doesn't mean "bridge".

984
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,600
It doesn't? I'm sorry.

985
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,160
I saw that this place
is called Narukokyo.

986
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,440
But it doesn't mean "bridge."

987
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,480
I see.

988
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,360
Then what is that bridge?

989
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,640
Miyazon receives good news here.

990
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
To the next autumn leaves spot,

991
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,680
we'll take a helicopter.

992
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,480
Yes!

993
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,320
Here it is!

994
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,920
Let's go!

995
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,240
- Awesome.
- Here.

996
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,800
Now I'm back on the helicopter.

997
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,720
The helicopter continues
to head north.

998
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,000
Then, something comes into view.

999
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,560
It's a massive lake!

1000
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,800
It's huge!

1001
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,440
Here's the last autumn leaves spot.

1002
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,480
Lake Towada, Aomori.

1003
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,200
Because of the complex terrain,

1004
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,240
there's a wide variety of trees,

1005
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,400
where visitors enjoy
different types of autumn leaves.

1006
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,680
Autumn leaves and a lake
look great together.

1007
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,320
Let's go down then.

1008
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,840
Around that spot.

1009
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,400
Around there.

1010
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,760
Here we go.

1011
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,560
I came down.

1012
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,520
Miyazon even travelled through time,

1013
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,040
and now it's sunrise time.

1014
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,840
The sun is rising slowly.

1015
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,640
I can see it!

1016
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,880
It's a few centimetres away.

1017
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,400
Then the entire sun will appear.

1018
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,720
Then...

1019
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,920
The sun has risen!

1020
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,480
It's beautiful!

1021
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,080
Ta-da!

1022
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,280
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

1023
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,360
When the sun rises,

1024
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,440
autumn leaves are illuminated
by the sun, and glow orange.

1025
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,920
You don't get to have
a morning like this very often.

1026
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,240
You see?

1027
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,600
You usually wake up to an alarm
to go to work.

1028
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,000
You then set the snooze
for another 15 minutes.

1029
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,040
Snooze, snooze.

1030
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,080
Many people have mornings like that,
but not today.

1031
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,920
Despite taking a lot of detours,

1032
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,600
Miyazon fully enjoyed autumn leaves
in different parts of Japan.

1033
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,200
How did you like it?

1034
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,120
Everyone has different opinions,

1035
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
but I assume about
70 per cent of people

1036
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,320
who watched the show
thought it looked wonderful.

1037
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,920
Okay, now let's go back
to the studio!

1038
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,400
Here I go!

1039
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,080
I do this to go up to an airplane
or come down from it.

1040
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,640
That's all for Miyazon's
autumn leaves tour.

1041
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,000
There were so many things
other than autumn leaves.

1042
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,920
That's true.

1043
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,640
It was quite messy.

1044
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,840
What I remember the most right now
is the amount of medicine.

1045
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,600
- The cameraman's.
- Yes, Cameraman Yamamoto's.

1046
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,280
But they only spent 30 seconds
to show each place.

1047
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,600
We'd be angry
if that happened to us.

1048
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,200
What I remember the most
is how delicious the ramen looked.

1049
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,160
It looked great!
