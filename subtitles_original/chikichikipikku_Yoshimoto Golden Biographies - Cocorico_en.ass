Dialogue: 0,0:37:06.48,0:37:11.72,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and the birth of my first daughter was a big thing at that time I mean the wedding was big too
Dialogue: 0,0:37:11.72,0:37:19.56,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,but the fact that I was now a father and I was putting 100 percent into raising her
Dialogue: 0,0:37:19.56,0:37:23.07,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and I knew I was going to see less and less of my daughter and that caused it.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:23.07,0:37:28.24,Jinnai Tomonori,,0,0,0,,So more than the divorce with your wife it was the thought of losing time with your daughter.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:28.24,0:37:31.38,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,Well yeah Chiaki and I discussed many things and could continue to communicate as adults
Dialogue: 0,0:37:31.38,0:37:38.42,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,but to discuss this with a child they can’t really process it the same and that really hit me
Dialogue: 0,0:37:40.07,0:38:00.24,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and then on Christmas day or Christmas eve it was scary that we decided to separate on Christmas eve
Dialogue: 0,0:38:00.24,0:38:06.38,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and we signed the paperwork that night and the atmosphere in the home was just so bad

Dialogue: 0,0:38:15.72,0:38:22.16,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and well I thought I would call Sanmsan but he was doing a live show...
Dialogue: 0,0:38:22.16,0:38:32.80,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,...and does a live show on Christmas eve where he discusses loss and things like that but I had completely forgotten about that
Dialogue: 0,0:38:32.80,0:38:41.82,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,but before the show started Sanmasan and I called him and said "Hello this is Endo" and he said "hey what are you up to."
Dialogue: 0,0:38:41.01,0:38:41.82,Jinnai Tomonori,,0,0,0,,This was before the show started?
Dialogue: 0,0:38:41.82,0:38:51.82,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,Before it started, and I told him about the divorce and after a pause he said "you pass!"
Dialogue: 0,0:38:52.51,0:38:58.13,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,then he asked if I would talk about it on the air. I told him I had no problem about it,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:58.13,0:39:04.84,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,but I didn't think it was okay to do that without telling Chiaki about it,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:04.84,0:39:07.58,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,but yeah at that point it was just the worst.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:07.58,0:39:10.48,Jinnai Tomonori,,0,0,0,,I see now how the graph goes down like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:10.48,0:39:12.48,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,Yes so just straight down.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:13.06,0:39:21.06,Jinnai Tomonori,,0,0,0,,Not that this was not the end of your rough patch though, we have another video about an event that happened at that time.

Dialogue: 0,0:39:41.64,0:39:52.00,White,,0,0,0,,In 2007 Endo and Chiaki divorced and was forced to live separately from his 4-year-old daughter which caused him so much stress,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:52.00,0:39:56.18,White,,0,0,0,,but even after that Endo faced another problem.

Dialogue: 0,0:40:09.44,0:40:17.27,LB1 - White in green,,0,0,0,,So the way he was handling his money was well not good I guess,
Dialogue: 0,0:40:17.27,0:40:23.31,LB1 - White in green,,0,0,0,,no matter how much he was earning he would talk about how he would gain money by spending it on investments
Dialogue: 0,0:40:23.31,0:40:26.81,LB1 - White in green,,0,0,0,,in like some bizarre dreamland of handling money
Dialogue: 0,0:40:26.81,0:40:35.75,LB1 - White in green,,0,0,0,,here we told him "this is dangerous, this is not good" but end went on to say that he is going to lose all his money.

Dialogue: 0,0:40:54.05,0:41:11.59,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,well the start of the divorce was also in part because of this. I would get money and had this guy who told me about an opportunity
Dialogue: 0,0:41:11.59,0:41:28.07,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,where I could double my money in two weeks and Chiaki would say "no you can really make money like this"
Dialogue: 0,0:41:28.07,0:41:36.48,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and said "you have to stop this" and yes at this time I was secretly doing this and then she caught me doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:41:36.48,0:41:41.35,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,and that’s when things started to get worse.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:41.35,0:41:44.19,Housei - White in Red,,0,0,0,,So how much money did you spend on these investments in total?

Dialogue: 0,0:43:12.78,0:43:21.36,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,I mean we didn't talk so much but with the divorce and all I had to tell him about it anyway
Dialogue: 0,0:43:21.36,0:43:35.34,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,so I told him "you know I am getting divorced" I thought he might get angry with me like "I told you you rushed into it" or something but instead he said
Dialogue: 0,0:43:35.34,0:43:48.35,Endo - White in blue,,0,0,0,,"hmm? that’s interesting" like in the world of performers I thought he would be the one to get angry about something like that but instead.
