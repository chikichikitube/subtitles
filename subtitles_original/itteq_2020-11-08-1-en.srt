1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,840
Whoa!

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,440
It's pretty!

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,360
"THE QUEST"

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
"This program was broadcast
8th November, 2020"

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,120
The Quest has begun.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,920
Tonight, we have Imoto's Japan Tour,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
and Lotti Nakaoka's QTube!
We have two sections!

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,240
Yes!

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,480
First, here is Imoto.
Where did you go this time?

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,600
I went to Nagano Prefecture.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,640
- That's a nice place.
- It was very nice.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,640
It's a prefecture where many
active elderly people live!

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,280
Sorry to say this, but you'll
only see old men in this video.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,920
Seriously?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
A lot of healthy old men.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,000
That's great.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,920
"Imoto Japan Tour in Nagano"

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,920
Wow, it's pretty.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,040
It's all red.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,120
Here are yellow and green.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
Beautiful colours.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,240
I've got to do it.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,920
"Lotti Nakaoka's QTube"

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Fun video challenge
in Nara and Mie"

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,680
The goal is to cover
all 47 prefectures of Japan.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,440
This is the rare animal hunter
Imoto's Japan Tour!

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,560
This time, she goes to central Japan

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,240
to Nagano Prefecture, which is
adjacent to eight prefectures.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,480
Hello, hello, hello. This is Imoto.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm visiting Nagano Prefecture
right now.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,400
Can you spot me?

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,520
Here's our usual "Find Imoto"!

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
- The centre.
- I see her!

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,520
- I'm right here!
- I see her!

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
- I'm right here.
- She's on a bike.

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,440
I am currently

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,320
- riding a bike above a pond.
- Interesting.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,560
It's a rare activity which
is actually the first in Japan,

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,920
called Kogidasu.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,280
You can go cycling
10 metres high in the air.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,200
It's fun!

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,960
About 80 percent of Nagano
Prefecture is mountains and plateau.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,880
The biggest goal of this trip

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,000
is to see a breath-taking view
of Japan Alps.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
You can see incredible autumn leaves
only during this season in Nagano.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,640
I'd love to share that with you all.

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Let's get started with Nagano Tour.

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,640
First, she visits a famous person
all the locals know about.

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,240
This person lives in Karuizawa Town.

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,480
Is that him?

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,120
I see a signboard,
and it's quite obvious.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Is this the person?

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
With bees?

54
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,680
At the store, there are photos
of old men covered in bees.

55
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,760
We can see the man growing older.

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
He looks older in this one.

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,480
He looks the youngest in this one.
Was it when he started?

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
It looks like he's begging the bees
to not sting him.

59
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,240
He looks nervous.

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,040
But over here,
he looks more at ease.

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,760
He's like, "I'm okay now."

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,240
In this one,
I can see he loves bees.

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,280
He loves bees a lot. The amount
of bees also increased.

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,280
Here is the master of bees.

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Yoshizo Ogiwara, 79 years old.

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
Do you put bees on your body
like in the photos?

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,960
Why did you start doing that?

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Actually, I often have people
visiting me to film TV shows.

69
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,440
A lot of people visit.

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,480
Someone said, "We've all seen people
gathering honey,

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
so please do something different."

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
That sounds selfish.

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,920
So it all began because
of a TV crew... or the media.

74
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,120
- They pressured you to do it.
- Exactly.

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
You were trying to entertain them.

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,840
He unwillingly started
covering himself in bees

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
for TV crews to have good shows.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,360
You get stung by them, don't you?

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,120
Yes, I get stung a lot.

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Oh no.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
This isn't funny.

82
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Today, I would like to show you

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,120
me being covered in bees.

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Thank you.

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm not sure what will happen
at the end.

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,800
That's scary.

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,720
To make it clear, we repeatedly
told him not to do it.

88
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,240
But he really wants to show
his new skill

89
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,800
that he obtained, just for us.

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,680
It's called "honey bee hat."

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Let's take a look
at his incredible skill!

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
There are so many!

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,000
Bees are starting to cover up

94
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,640
his upper body right now.

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,960
They're sticking to him.

96
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,920
The honey bread man's friends
are Western honeybees.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Using their habit of swarming
the queen bee,

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,600
he skilfully guides
his 30,000 honeybees.

99
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,920
Oh no!

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,520
Look at his neck! It looks crazy.

101
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,880
He's smiling.

102
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
With a peace sign.

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
He places the queen bee
on top of his head,

104
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
and waits for 10 minutes.

105
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,240
Incredible.

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,240
Finally, the honeybee hat
is finished.

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,120
It doesn't exactly look like a hat,
but it's nice.

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
It's a masterful skill that one can
only do with bees' trust.

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,400
However, it's not just him
who is fascinated by bees.

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,040
Next, we'll introduce masters
at catching bees.

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,520
With the average age
of 70 years old,

112
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,120
they are members of Ina City
Local Bee Association.

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Now, we'll do sugareoi.

114
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
Sugareoi?

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,360
We call the local bee "sugare."

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,920
They have nests underground.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
We'll dig them up
and we'll all eat them.

118
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Sugareoi is a tradition in Nagano
where they look for bee nests.

119
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,800
But how will they find
nests underground?

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,280
I see something.

121
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,200
This is common squid,
and it attracts bees.

122
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,040
This is the bee
that they call sugare.

123
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,240
They give them feed with a mark
called "itome."

124
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,120
They eat the feed and bring it
back to their nests.

125
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,880
By chasing the bees,
you'll know where their nests are.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,520
I'm not sure where the bee will go.

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
That's why we'll chase them.

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,920
Whether there will be a tree
or river, they'll chase the bee.

129
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,560
They'll even dash through fields
and mountains.

130
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Please fly.

131
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,440
Please fly.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,640
- Start.
- Here it goes!

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
As soon as the bee flies,
elderly guys start sprinting.

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,840
Everyone is very fast!

135
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,200
I never thought I'd be slower
than people in their 70s!

136
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,040
They could be going
in the same direction.

137
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
- The nest is that way.
- Get ready.

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Get ready.

139
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,760
Here it goes!

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
By releasing bees from where
they lost track of them,

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,760
they'll try to find the area
where their nests are.

142
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,520
Is this fun?

143
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Yes, we do this all day long.

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,800
I guess that's the secret
to staying healthy.

145
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,720
Nagano has one of the best
life expectancies in Japan.

146
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,840
Where is it?

147
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,280
Elderly people are incredibly
healthy and quite active.

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
We'll keep chasing it this time.

149
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,440
Don't lose track of them.

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
Let's go!

151
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,120
They've chased 10 bees so far.

152
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Here it goes.

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Is it here?

154
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
Finally, they found the nests.

155
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,320
We could've never found this
on our own.

156
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
There's no honey in sugare's nests.

157
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,080
They're looking for bee larva,
which is very nutritious.

158
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,400
So that's the nest of local bees.

159
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Exactly.

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,640
This is huge.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,120
- Whoa!
- Here it goes!

162
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,040
It's massive!

163
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,920
- Let's show it.
- Yeah, please.

164
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,800
- There's more below.
- It's huge.

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
The nests underground
had nine different levels.

166
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Bee larva is a precious source
of protein in Nagano,

167
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,520
which is not facing any seas.

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
It's a traditional dish that has
been loved by locals for many years.

169
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,600
It's a bit creamy.

170
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Very good.

171
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,440
This is power food.

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,040
You all looked like boys
in elementary school.

173
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,720
You had eyes of young boys.

174
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,360
There's nothing more fun than bees.

175
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,640
Next up is a company from Nagano
which is number one in Japan.

176
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,280
It's Kashiyama Kogyo in Saku City.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
What kind of company is this?

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,520
At Kashiyama Kogyo,
we manufacture vacuum pumps.

179
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,440
In terms of dry vacuum pumps,

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,760
our company has the second
largest share in the world.

181
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
Second largest in the world?

182
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,280
Vacuum pumps are a device that
removes air and creates a vacuum.

183
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,560
Vacuum is a space filled
with gas at a pressure

184
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
lower than atmospheric pressure.

185
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,920
It means that it's a space
with thin air.

186
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,240
The pumps are used by liquid crystal
and smartphone manufacturers.

187
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,400
When making electronic components
such as semiconductors,

188
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,880
they work under the vacuum state
where impurities in the air

189
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,000
are as non-existent as possible.

190
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,240
Today, we prepared an experiment
using the vacuum state.

191
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,320
You prepared all that for us?

192
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
It'll look great on TV.

193
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,560
The logo is much bigger now
compared to when I visited before.

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,680
The logo is much bigger now.

195
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,560
First is marshmallow,
which is a typical example.

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,560
Here's a vacuum quiz.

197
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
What will happen
to these marshmallows?

198
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Ms Oshima! Please answer.

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Under vacuum state,
they go like this!

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,720
and they shrink like that.

201
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
They get smaller.

202
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,560
What happens when marshmallows
are in a vacuum state?

203
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,800
They're expanding!

204
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Really?

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
- They're getting bigger.
- It's the opposite?

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,720
Wow, they're expanding a lot!

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,480
Marshmallows under normal state
contain a lot of air,

208
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,120
but under a vacuum condition
there is no pressure,

209
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
so the air expands, which makes
marshmallows swell up.

210
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,240
Now I'm going to add air.

211
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,400
When air is added,
they shrink smaller than before

212
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,760
because of the absence of air
in the vacuum state.

213
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,440
They expand and then shrink.

214
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,120
In the vacuum state there are almost
no molecules to transmit vibrations,

215
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,680
so no sound is heard.

216
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't hear it anymore.

217
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,320
I don't hear it at all,
though it's vibrating.

218
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,080
Does that mean there's no sound
in the space?

219
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,040
That's true.

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,240
Next, Japan's top vacuum pumps
and Imoto have a battle.

221
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,400
The battle takes place
in a baseball stadium.

222
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,720
This one is called a vacuum cannon.

223
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,360
We'll do an experiment where we'll
throw a ball using a vacuum pump.

224
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,480
I see.

225
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,240
We'll place a ball over here,

226
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,000
and pulls it with a vacuum pump.

227
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,040
We'll place a plate over here.

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,960
By hitting it strongly
with a hammer,

229
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,040
air will suddenly flow
into a vacuum.

230
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,840
With that momentum,
the ball will be thrown out.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
That sounds scary.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
What will happen?

233
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,240
How fast will the ball be thrown?

234
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,920
It's a tie in the bottom
of the ninth inning,

235
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
with bases loaded and two outs.

236
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Here I go.

237
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,520
- Imoto the batter gives it a try.
- That's scary.

238
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,880
Here comes the first pitch.

239
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
One!

240
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,360
Go!

241
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
It was so quick!

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,840
Strike.

243
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,120
That was so fast!

244
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,400
208 kilometres.

245
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,280
208 kilometres?

246
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Humans can never get that speed.

247
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,800
When it was launched, it only took
0.3 seconds to hit the net.

248
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,880
There's no way she can hit it
with a full swing.

249
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,440
Shall we do a bunt?

250
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,680
So I'll hold the bat at the ready
the entire time?

251
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,000
It'll be at 200 kilometres per hour.

252
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,400
Ouch! My fingers!

253
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
My fingers!

254
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,640
It's just a married couple
joking around.

255
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,920
It'll be hell.

256
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Here comes the ace relief pitcher
of Koshiyama Kogyo.

257
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,240
That tube is twice longer
than what we had.

258
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,360
It's four metres long.

259
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
What happens with four metres?

260
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,480
One time, it went through the net.

261
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,400
It went through the net,
and flew into that side.

262
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,920
Seriously?

263
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,480
Will we have the world record speed?

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,760
It's an experiment of the century.

265
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,720
- Here it comes.
- Come on.

266
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,520
Three.

267
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,640
Two.

268
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
One.

269
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,880
I couldn't see it.

270
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,120
I only heard the sound.

271
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
It was 271 kilometres per hour.

272
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
What was that?

273
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,800
Seriously?

274
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
It so fast it's funny.

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm scared.

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,160
This won't be a fair battle.

277
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,840
So Imoto will be given a handicap.

278
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,760
The pitches are 90 metres away
from home plate.

279
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,240
Will it be a strike,
and she will strike out?

280
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,040
Or will it be a wild pitch?

281
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,040
Or will Imoto hit the ball?

282
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Here comes an important pitch!

283
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,200
Here I go!

284
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
Come on.

285
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,280
All right.

286
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,120
- Come on?
- What will happen?

287
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,200
Three.

288
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
Two.

289
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
One.

290
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,600
It went near the edge.

291
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,200
The ball pitched from the centre
didn't curve at all,

292
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,560
and reached Imoto
within only one second.

293
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,320
"It took one second to reach Imoto"

294
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,400
One!

295
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,400
Whoa!

296
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,680
Imoto was hit with a pitch.

297
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,120
The Quest team miraculously won!

298
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,560
I wasn't expecting that.

299
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
That was scary.

300
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Without the protector,
I would've been dead.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
But I'm glad.

302
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
It's a good way to end this section.

303
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

304
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
This was probably
what we all wanted.

305
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,040
Now that we're exhausted,
let's relax in a hot spring next.

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,280
Nagano is number two in Japan in
terms of the number of hot springs.

307
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
Hello.

308
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,200
This time, she visits a hot spring
which is very rare in the world.

309
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,880
We have a matchmaking hot spring.

310
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
Matchmaking hot spring?

311
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Shosenkaku, a hot spring hotel
located in Nagano City is known for

312
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,800
their matchmaking hot spring that
they've been offering for 35 years.

313
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,000
In Nagano,
mixed baths are not allowed.

314
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,960
But many men have a desire
to go into a mixed bath.

315
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,520
There is a small shrine on the wall
dividing two baths,

316
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,720
and when you pull strings,
the door opens

317
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,520
and they can talk to someone
on the other side.

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,680
By the way, the strings are only
attached on the woman's bath side.

319
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,680
It cannot be opened
from the men's bath.

320
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,880
There are actually thee couples
who got married

321
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,600
after meeting in this hot spring.

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,280
There might be a man waiting
on the other side.

323
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,840
I'm nervous.

324
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,480
Of course, there won't be men
all the time.

325
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,400
They have to be at the same place
at the same time,

326
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,400
which sounds like fate.

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,280
Oh! I see someone.

328
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,360
Someone is there.

329
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,960
I see his hands.

330
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,800
Looking at his skin, he seems young.

331
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Here I go.

332
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,040
Feeling nervous,
they meet for the first time.

333
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,800
Here it is.

334
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,720
Let's go to the mountain together
to see autumn leaves.

335
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
Wait,

336
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,240
He's a geezer.

337
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,840
Where are you going?

338
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,200
Karasawa Cirque.

339
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,240
Karasawa Cirque?

340
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,360
It's famous for autumn leaves.

341
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,960
It's very pretty.

342
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,840
But I'd be happy to see autumn
leaves with you, Mr Nukita.

343
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,000
Before that,

344
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,720
we'll go pick rock tripes
growing on rocks.

345
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,080
That sounds fun.

346
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,120
- They're tasty.
- Really?

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,880
That sounds autumn-like.

348
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,360
Let's go pick rock tripes
the geezer loves!

349
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,120
They arrive at Kitaaiki Village
with a population of 700 people.

350
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,120
Mr Katsuji Ide
is a mushroom picking master.

351
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,240
We're here to pick rock tripes.

352
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
Are they famous in this area?

353
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,840
They're kind of famous.

354
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
But not many people like it.

355
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,760
They're tasteless.

356
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,800
Well...

357
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,120
But they're legendary mushrooms.
Well, actually they're moss.

358
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,040
I've never tried it before,
so I'm interested.

359
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,600
It's autumn now.

360
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,160
Mushrooms are great in autumn.

361
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,480
We can pick rock tripes
all year around though,

362
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,240
so it's not specifically good
in autumn.

363
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
Is that so?

364
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
Really?

365
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,760
It is believed that rock tripes
were food of hermits.

366
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,720
In the ancient times, it was
believed to bring immortality.

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,560
They're called legendary because
they only grow on steep rocks

368
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,520
higher than 1,000 metres.

369
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,080
It's difficult to pick them.

370
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,760
I see.

371
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,200
Impressive.

372
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,880
They're all over the rocks.

373
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,840
Here are rock tripes,
which is a kind of moss.

374
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,400
They grow very slowly, and grow
only one millimetre per year.

375
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,440
Because it's so rare, it's sold for
15,000 yen per kilogram.

376
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,800
It's a luxurious food item.

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
I see very large ones.

378
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll put water on them.

379
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,040
Get them wet.

380
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,280
Since they get dry on a sunny day,

381
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,800
they crumble if you pick them
right away.

382
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,120
It's like climbing a mountain.

383
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,600
She'll harvest them
after sprinkling some water.

384
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
It looks like it's her job.

385
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,200
Okay, I'll take a large chunk.

386
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,320
Go for it.

387
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,480
Imoto finds a rock tripe
which is about 70 years old.

388
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
That looks great.

389
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,640
This much?

390
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,640
All right.

391
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
Now, let's eat
the legendary rock tripes!

392
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,800
The master's wife is going to cook
the rock tripes.

393
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,200
She soaks rock tripes in water
and sprinkles salt on them.

394
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,160
She then stir-fries them
with sugar, sake, and soy sauce.

395
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,040
It's the local tradition to eat them
with rice.

396
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,360
Let's eat.

397
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,840
She went through all the trouble
to pick them. How do they taste?

398
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,800
It's good.

399
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,680
It goes very well with rice.

400
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,160
The flavour is soaked in well.

401
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
It's like seaweed paste.

402
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
It has a great texture.

403
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,600
- It's thicker than seaweed paste.
- That's true.

404
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,640
It's good.

405
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,960
Master doesn't pay attention
to rock tripes,

406
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,080
and starts grilling something
on charcoal.

407
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,720
Are these matsutake mushroom?

408
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,640
That's right.

409
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
I can smell them.

410
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,880
- Let's eat.
- Nagano Prefecture

411
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,040
is the number-one producer
of matsutake mushrooms in Japan.

412
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,040
She takes a bit bite into
the autumn food.

413
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Mr Nukita is behind her.

414
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,600
So good!

415
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
It's 1,000 times better
than rock tripes.

416
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,120
Don't say that.

417
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,640
- It's incredible!
- Here, they have an intruder.

418
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,120
Ms Imoto.

419
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Helmet young man.

420
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,680
Flower.

421
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Kids in front of TV.

422
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,040
I'll make flowers bloom for you.

423
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,320
Ta-da.

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,440
This young guy who messed up
on national TV

425
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,200
is actually someone who works
at Kitaaiki Village Office,

426
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,840
named Kota Sakamoto.

427
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,760
They're flowers made of wood.

428
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
What?

429
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
He isn't behaving strangely
because he wants to stand out.

430
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,520
Where did you come from?

431
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
Three days before filming,

432
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,440
he told our crew members
who were visiting the village,

433
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
that not just rock tripes,

434
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,560
but their flowers made of wood
shavings should also be on the show.

435
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,680
But our crew members told him

436
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
that The Quest isn't
an informative show,

437
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,800
and it's tricky to deal with topics
that are not funny.

438
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,840
So he gave it a lot of thought.

439
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,480
On the day of filming,

440
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,720
he then proposed a bit
that would be funny.

441
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,080
He even wrote my lines.

442
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,920
I'm talking to the mushroom master,
and someone suddenly appears,

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
so I ask, "who is that person?"

444
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,120
Then Sakamoto runs to me
and says, Helmet Flower.

445
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
He does that here.

446
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
You had to say no to him.

447
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,960
You should've said,
"Sorry, but we can't."

448
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,720
Their speciality looks great,
though.

449
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,200
Do you want us to cut this part,
then?

450
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,400
Do you think we should?

451
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,920
Do I think you should cut this?

452
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,240
This is what he believes in,
and he loves his hometown.

453
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,960
When it's too much of that,
it becomes madness.

454
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
Thank you for waiting.

455
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,040
At last, let's go to the famous
autumn leaves spot!

456
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,520
Thank you for waiting.

457
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,840
At last, let's go to the famous
autumn leaves spot!

458
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
It's a place called Karasawa Cirque
located in the North Alps.

459
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,560
It's 2,300 metres high.

460
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,840
The distance is about 15 kilometres.

461
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,880
It'll take six hours to get there.

462
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,560
It's been a long time...

463
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,280
since I walked in a mountain
with a proper outfit.

464
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,720
But she has already walked
this path many times before

465
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
when she camped for Manaslu,
and also on 24 Hour TV.

466
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,280
She realises that
this part won't be aired,

467
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,040
so she doesn't say a word,

468
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,640
and continues walking
in a matter-of-fact manner.

469
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
After six hours,

470
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,160
she arrives at Karasawa Cirque,
well-known for its autumn leaves.

471
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
That was so quick!

472
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,640
It's so pretty!

473
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
It's all red!
I see yellow and green.

474
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,840
Beautiful colours!

475
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,480
Amazing.

476
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,800
I also see colourful tents

477
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,800
which are typical
of Karasawa Cirque.

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Cirques are valleys
formed by glacial erosion,

479
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,520
which look as if carved out
with a spoon.

480
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,680
Incredible.

481
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,280
Around the cirque,
there are Hodaka mountains,

482
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,760
which are all about
3,000 metres high.

483
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,160
These leaves all look red.

484
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,040
This is Betula ermanii,
which has a golden yellow colour.

485
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,760
Japanese rowam
has a fiery red colour.

486
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,720
The contrast between the leaves
and the monotone background

487
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,480
makes a breath-taking view that we
can only see on a mountain.

488
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,480
That's all for Nagano Japan Tour.

489
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Next up is this.

490
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

491
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,480
Yes!

492
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,720
I went to my home prefecture, Nara.

493
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,280
- Really?
- Yes.

494
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,440
You're now a top-class comedian.

495
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,360
Are you going to panic because
you're a top-class comedian?

496
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
Mr Uchimura, you say that a lot.

497
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,440
But it has never made it
on internet news.

498
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,200
- Seriously?
- Nothing.

499
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,480
It's all quiet.

500
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,880
But he's a top-class comedian.

501
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,880
Hello, this is Lotti Nakaoka.

502
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,480
I'm visiting a factory
in Nara Prefecture right now.

503
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,560
What am I making now?

504
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This time, Nakaoka will promote
a speciality from Nara Prefecture.

505
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
This thing is famous
in Nara Prefecture.

506
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,680
The thing that I'm making will
come out from here, so take a look.

507
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,400
Here it comes!

508
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,640
Here's the answer.

509
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,600
- It's a sock.
- Really?

510
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Nara Prefecture is the number-one
producer of socks.

511
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Charix here was built to promote
their socks.

512
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,320
Just by choosing
a colour and cycle for five minutes,

513
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,160
customers can easily knit
their original socks.

514
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,880
- Cool.
- I want to try.

515
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,120
At the end, the tip parts
with a hole are sewn together.

516
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
I'm going to try it on.

517
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,080
They become a shape
we're all familiar with.

518
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,000
All right.

519
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,160
Isn't this great?

520
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,640
Lotti Nakaoka QTube.

521
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,920
Nara is a great place!
I'll do my best!

522
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,080
All right.

523
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,560
We'll go to Mie Prefecture now.

524
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,520
What?

525
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,240
What about Nara?

526
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,520
For Nara...

527
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,280
- This is it.
- This is it?

528
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
He arrives at Ise Shima,
Mie Prefecture.

529
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,520
First, he'll try challenge videos
from around the world.

530
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,600
Nakaoka basketball spin.

531
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,320
He's trying this
on a burning hot iron plate,

532
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,640
which has been heated up
under the scorching sun.

533
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,880
Be careful.

534
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,360
Nice.

535
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
Oh no, it's extremely hot.

536
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
It's extremely hot.

537
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,120
First, he puts a basketball
on top of the iron plate,

538
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,200
and balances on his chest.

539
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,040
This looks scary.

540
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,360
Here I go.

541
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,880
Here I go.

542
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,760
Can he spin and have
the ball under his back?

543
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,320
Good luck.

544
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
- Go!
- You can do it!

545
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,800
- You can do it!
- Wait.

546
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
Here it goes.

547
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
Hot, hot!

548
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,760
It's too hot.

549
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,400
This isn't good. Seriously.

550
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
This part hit for a moment.

551
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,400
I went like this, and this.

552
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,680
It's possible to do it.

553
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,200
But this is too hot.

554
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,800
It's seriously too hot.

555
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
I'll turn now.

556
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Let's try again.

557
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,760
Good luck!

558
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,800
Here I go.

559
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
You can do it.

560
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,600
Oh no.

561
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
It's getting hard.

562
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,560
Turn around.

563
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,360
Ouch!

564
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,560
Here I go.

565
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
Wait.

566
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,160
It's hot!

567
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,600
No, It's too hot.

568
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,560
He tries something else
on the burning iron plate.

569
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,040
Anna Maria from Italy will remotely
teach him how to do it.

570
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,160
I'll show you a challenge
which will be very easy.

571
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,520
From standing up, sit down,

572
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,600
and stand up again.

573
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
But don't put the hands
on the floor.

574
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,800
It looks easy, but is it actually
difficult to do?

575
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,600
He tries this on a safe area
on the burning iron plate.

576
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,360
But if he can't stand up
after 15 seconds,

577
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,280
there will no longer be
a safe area.

578
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,600
Will Nakaoka beat the challenge
within the time limit?

579
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,680
It's scary to be barefoot.

580
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,960
It's incredibly scary.

581
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
Ready, set,

582
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,720
go!

583
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,760
This challenge is easy
until he sits down.

584
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,160
But standing up without using hands
is quite difficult.

585
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,520
It must be difficult.

586
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,520
Five seconds left.

587
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,320
- Oh no.
- This isn't good.

588
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,040
Wait!

589
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Nakaoka tries desperately
to keep the safe area.

590
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,800
I should be ashamed.

591
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,600
I should be ashamed of what I did
as a QTuber.

592
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,360
Let's try it again.

593
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,480
Good luck!

594
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,560
Will he succeed this time?

595
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,600
- Go.
- All right.

596
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,840
Nakaoka wants to avoid the burning
hot iron plate as much as he can.

597
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
He builds up momentum.

598
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Go!

599
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
- Go!
- You can do it!

600
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,560
This is the last part!

601
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,840
It's so hot!

602
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,600
You stupid!

603
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,160
It was hotter that he could handle,

604
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,080
so Nakaoka attacks
the director in charge.

605
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,680
This isn't good.

606
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,800
Something flew in.

607
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,680
It's so hot that I couldn't help
taking it out on someone.

608
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,800
They threw the towel roughly.

609
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,200
He's a top-class comedian.

610
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,640
He's a top-class comedian.

611
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
- They threw the towel like this.
- He's a top-class comedian.

612
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,600
They're always like that.

613
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,080
On a table.

614
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,800
It's like a mum
throwing cloth over a table.

615
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,480
It looks just like that.

616
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,800
Next is a challenge video, where
he'll win a prize if he succeeds.

617
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,840
Nakaoka, staircase, paper catch.

618
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,800
He'll win a prize if he can catch
paper before it falls on the floor.

619
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,600
We'll try this at Shima
Mediterranean Village,

620
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,040
on a Greek style staircase.

621
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,640
What I'm concerned about is...

622
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,800
the wind blowing between
the buildings.

623
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
Here I go!

624
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,120
He'll win a prize if he can succeed
in one try.

625
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,240
Start.

626
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,280
Where is it?

627
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,600
Paper is not coming down at all.

628
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,720
Seriously?

629
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,920
Is this okay?

630
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,120
He catches it easily.

631
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,400
I caught it.

632
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,400
I caught it.

633
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Here's the prize he was promised.

634
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,080
Fake one-million yen bills.

635
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,760
I don't like it at all.

636
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
That's not what we mean.

637
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,920
There are 100 bills in this,
so throw them all in the air.

638
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,680
We'll give you 1,000 yen each
for bills that you'll catch.

639
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
That'd be amazing.

640
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,120
He'll use a blank pile of bills
often used in films.

641
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,120
I see.

642
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,440
He'll receive 1,000 yen
for each bill that he catches.

643
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,480
Go get it.

644
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,240
It'd be better to spread them.

645
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,440
He could be rich after this!

646
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,320
The show has never been
so generous before.

647
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,360
Will Nakaoka win a lot of money?

648
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,720
Here I go!

649
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,240
Here I go!

650
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,120
Hurry!

651
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
You can do it!

652
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,240
1,000 yen.

653
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,480
1,000 yen.

654
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,520
1,000 yen.

655
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,640
1,000 yen.

656
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,080
It's just 1,000 yen.

657
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm sorry you had to see me
like that.

658
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm sure my parents
would hate to see me like that.

659
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,760
Next is a video that's going viral
in the world.

660
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Using coins laid
on a piece of board,

661
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,640
he'll show a message in the air.

662
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,720
Here's what he'll use.

663
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,520
They're coins from the overseas
filming trips of this show.

664
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,520
I see.

665
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,240
But I know many people put coins
in a donation box.

666
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,240
You're the only ones
who brought these home.

667
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,320
What kind of message
will Nakaoka send?

668
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,560
It'll be a message for one
of the people at the studio.

669
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,520
Let's see who
his message will be for.

670
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,240
Wait.

671
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,320
What's going on?

672
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,880
For when it goes up,

673
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,640
do I have to flip letters?

674
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,600
Yes, letters need to be flipped.

675
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,400
The size and weight
are also important.

676
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
Iceland.

677
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,240
It's a coin from Iceland.

678
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,720
Africa.

679
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,280
Africa.

680
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,160
What's this?

681
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,960
Horumon Construction?

682
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
Corporate?

683
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,000
It's from an amusement arcade.

684
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,080
All right.

685
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,960
Here's a message from Nakaoka
to a certain person at the studio.

686
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
Congrats.

687
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
The Quest.

688
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,760
The Quest.

689
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,200
Regular.

690
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
Degawa.

691
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,720
Awesome.

692
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,280
I can see it clearly.

693
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,360
Nice.

694
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,920
I'll do a portrait.

695
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,360
He'll finish this
with a self-portrait.

696
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
You put too much hair on your head.

697
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,440
I wasn't paying attention to that.

698
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,240
Can I make it more realistic?

699
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,000
- Here.
- I've got a bald spot here.

700
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
Look at that.

701
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,640
I get Twitter and Instagram
direct messages

702
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,720
from people trying to sell me
hair growth formula.

703
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
I've got 10 messages so far.

704
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,960
For some reason,
I've also got one message

705
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,800
asking if I've got mould
in my washing machine.

706
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,200
Why did they think I'd have mould
in my washing machine,

707
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,800
and send me a direct message?

708
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,880
Next is a video with a great view
that went viral on social media.

709
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,120
Sky diving shot
with a 360-degree camera.

710
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,040
Nakaoka visits
Ise Shima Skydiving Club.

711
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,000
This is Rhys, the instructor.

712
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
No Japanese?

713
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
- Zero.
- Zero? Okay.

714
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,080
Country.

715
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,120
- New Zealand.
- He's from New Zealand.

716
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,040
I see. You know...

717
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,720
Conversations like this
with foreign people...

718
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,240
remind me of my trips.

719
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,880
But there's no interpreter because
they'll still in Japan.

720
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,920
So they'll use an app
to translate their conversation.

721
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,720
How long have you been skydiving?

722
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,360
How many years has it been
since I diving?

723
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,320
Me?

724
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,560
Twenty-three.

725
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,200
23 years.

726
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,360
You're experienced.

727
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,160
Have you ever failed?

728
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,160
Have you ever failed?

729
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,480
Skydiving airplane,
the engine blew up.

730
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,640
Skydiving airplane engine blew up.

731
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Seriously?

732
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,920
- Does that really happen?
- The voice sounds funny.

733
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,600
First, please enjoy the view of
Ise Shima shot by a normal camera.

734
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,760
"Nakaoka skydiving in Ise Shima"

735
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,120
Oh no.

736
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,120
I'm getting really scared.

737
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,000
I've got to do it.

738
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
I have to.

739
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,320
Nakaoka has a fear of heights.

740
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,520
He goes up to 3,000 metres
above the ground.

741
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Okay.

742
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,840
There he goes!

743
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,880
It's perfect weather,
without a single cloud.

744
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,600
Below them, the beautiful ridged
coast of Ise Shima spreads out.

745
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,840
Nice.

746
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,600
Look at his face.

747
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,840
I can't recognise him now.

748
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,720
Are we not there yet?

749
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,640
This feels nice.

750
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,640
Really?

751
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,080
Next, here is a video shot
by a 360-degree camera.

752
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,880
The image looks distorted because

753
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,080
it's a 360-degree image composited
together to fit the screen.

754
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Amazing.

755
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,240
If he looks down.

756
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,120
It's the Earth!

757
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,240
Amazing.

758
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,960
It looks exactly like the Earth.

759
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
"Earth"

760
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,960
The blue sky without clouds
looks like outer space.

761
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,280
The deeply indented coastline
resembles large continents.

762
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,600
Awesome.

763
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,600
You really are a top-class comedian.

764
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,760
Next, he'll try amazing tricks from
videos from all over the world.

765
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,480
He'll catch a flying disk
while facing his back to it,

766
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,920
let it pass under his crotch,

767
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,520
and put a plastic bottle
on top of it after spinning it.

768
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,520
The person who will throw
the flying disk is

769
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,760
Mr Maeda, who used to be
on the national team.

770
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,080
Let's do it here.

771
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,480
Let's have him throw one.

772
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,480
Here we go.

773
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,080
Wow.

774
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,360
I couldn't do it at all.

775
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,280
What?

776
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,640
I'll pay attention to this.

777
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,000
If he pays attention
to the plastic bottle...

778
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,280
he can't even catch a flying disk.

779
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,200
It's so hard.

780
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,480
Even after trying for two hours,
no success.

781
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,000
This isn't good!

782
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,040
"After three hours"

783
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,680
That was close!

784
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,400
Ouch.

785
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,120
That looks painful.

786
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,320
It's the plastic bottle
and the flying disk.

787
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,920
Both of them miraculously
hit Nakaoka's head.

788
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,200
Compared to how this part
normally looks,

789
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,920
it's swollen to twice larger.

790
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm receiving quite a bit of impact
each time.

791
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,600
It's been 4.5 hours
since the filming started.

792
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,080
Finally, the time has come.

793
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,920
Here's the first shot.

794
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,880
The timing was off.

795
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,640
It's too fast.

796
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,040
We've messed up.

797
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,080
He does a bit of
Cook Poko impression.

798
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,360
All right.

799
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,520
Then...

800
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,440
I did it!

801
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,880
Though the plastic bottle bounced
at first,

802
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,760
Nakaoka finally caught it.

803
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,480
That's incredible.

804
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,080
It's a miracle.

805
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
I did it!

806
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
See? I did it, right?

807
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,440
Right?

808
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,360
Yes!

809
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,840
Yeah!

810
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,520
Yeah!

811
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,160
We're behind schedule, so we'll
go to Nara to play volleyball.

812
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
Really?

813
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,840
The last part is a special project
called Karada Week.

814
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,080
It's a collaboration video with
high school students in Nara.

815
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,000
The last part is a special project
called Karada Week.

816
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,360
It's a collaboration video with
high school students in Nara.

817
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,840
He'll collaborate
with the volleyball team

818
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,320
of Nara Girls' High School.

819
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,160
They've competed in Inter-High
28 times before.

820
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
They also ranked eighth
at the spring competition.

821
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,600
It's a strong team
with a brilliant record.

822
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,840
They'll try "receive quick change."

823
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,080
They'll start with a serve,

824
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,000
and each member
will put on a jacket.

825
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,680
Can six members put on a jacket
without dropping the ball?

826
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,960
All right, let's go!

827
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,960
Okay.

828
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,120
No, serve.

829
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,800
First, let's see
Nakaoka's receiving skills.

830
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,160
All right.

831
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,400
Did you do a trick?

832
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,120
You did, didn't you?

833
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,520
I'm an amateur but I can tell.

834
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,120
Serve a straight shot.

835
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,800
She did a trick.

836
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,720
Was that a natural one?

837
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,920
Now they'll change clothes quickly.

838
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,520
It's a success once they put
both arms through the sleeves.

839
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
Be easy on me.

840
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
He's good.

841
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,520
Nice.

842
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,480
There's no way I can do this.

843
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
Let's have a member try.

844
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,200
Yurina in the second grade will try.

845
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,360
Yurina.

846
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,560
Her receives are great.

847
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,360
However...

848
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,360
You can do it.

849
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
It's hard.

850
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,200
What we know now is

851
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,160
that even for elite volleyball
members like them,

852
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,000
this is quite challenging.

853
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
Go!

854
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,880
Then, a strong player appears.

855
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,800
Go!

856
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,640
You can do it.

857
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,280
That's right.

858
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,880
Awesome.

859
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,680
Nice. It looks stable.

860
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,040
Manami, you look stable.

861
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,560
Let's have her give us some tips.

862
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,480
Bring the ball high up,

863
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,800
and put your right or left arm

864
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,360
- One arm first.
- through the sleeve.

865
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,280
Keeping tossing the ball
with one arm.

866
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,520
Then put your arm behind.

867
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,200
- That looks incredible!
- With Manami's advice,

868
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,800
the students quickly improved.

869
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,080
Now the pressure is on Nakaoka,
who will be the anchor.

870
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,760
With the coach's guidance,
he learns the basics.

871
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,280
Then...

872
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,360
It's too low.

873
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,240
Wow, he's getting better.

874
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,160
You almost got it.

875
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,320
He'll soon get it.

876
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
It's too high, so once you put in
one arm, keep it down a bit.

877
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
He's never even tried this.

878
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,480
Let's do the actual challenge.

879
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,880
With high school students
in Nara Prefecture,

880
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,840
I want to show you all
that we're all trying our best.

881
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,080
Let's do it.

882
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,720
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

883
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,640
- Let's go.
- Yes.

884
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,680
Receive quick change begins now.

885
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,240
I wanted to look cool in front
of the girls' volleyball team.

886
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
The first person is

887
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,680
the tallest attacker of the school
with the height of 171 centimetres,

888
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,080
named Kotona.

889
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
- Nice.
- She first shoots up the ball high,

890
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
and puts one arm through the sleeve.

891
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,480
Incredible.

892
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,280
This part is tricky.

893
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,200
Next, while tossing with one arm,
she puts another arm.

894
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,320
Next is the team clown Sayaka.

895
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,600
It looks stable.

896
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,640
You can do it!

897
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Okay!

898
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,160
Nice.

899
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,200
You're doing great.

900
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,280
Everyone is so good.

901
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,920
It looks very stable.

902
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,240
Very good.

903
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,440
- They're very calm.
- You can do it.

904
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,960
Here you go!

905
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay.

906
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,120
The third person is Manami
who's always stable.

907
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
She's stable.

908
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,400
Manami.

909
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,720
Her receives are some of the best
in the country.

910
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,120
She's very good.

911
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,480
Give me a minute.

912
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,440
Okay.

913
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,200
Yes!

914
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,800
The fifth member is Nanaka,
who's in third grade.

915
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,680
She's the captain.

916
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,520
This year, games and practises
were cancelled due to COVID.

917
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,240
Even then, she led the team
as the captain.

918
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,200
You can do it!

919
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,560
You can do it!

920
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,720
Go for it!

921
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
You can do it!

922
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,440
It'll be okay.

923
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,720
Use one arm.

924
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
That's right.

925
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,840
She's very good.

926
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,080
Awesome, great job.

927
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,040
She did a great job, and now
she'll pass it to a junior student.

928
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
You're doing great.

929
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,160
The ball is now passed to Yurina
in second grade.

930
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,520
She looks very calm, and doesn't
show that she's under pressure.

931
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,200
All right.

932
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,600
Now it'll be my turn.

933
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,720
He must be so nervous.

934
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,240
Pressure's on the sixth player.

935
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,600
She puts her arms
through the sleeves.

936
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,280
Wait for me.

937
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,440
Stay calm, okay?

938
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,960
Okay, come on.

939
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,600
Will Nakaoka succeed?

940
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,640
From there?

941
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,040
All right!

942
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,640
You can do it.

943
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,720
Failed.

944
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
This is really disappointing.

945
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,520
There's little time left before
the students leave the school.

946
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,120
Here, Nakaoka has a suggestion.

947
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,800
Can I ask you a favour?

948
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,840
I will shoot up the ball high
the second time.

949
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,720
I'll wear my jacket,

950
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,720
so could one of you
receive the ball?

951
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,280
Looking at the time,
this will be their last try.

952
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,480
For the last time, everyone will
chase the ball Nakaoka shoots up.

953
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,160
Let's do this!

954
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,680
Let's do it!

955
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,120
What is this?

956
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,400
Look at his face.

957
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,440
One person's mistake
is everyone's mistake.

958
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,360
Everyone is ignoring him.

959
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,560
Nobody responded.

960
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Everyone is doing a great job.

961
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,840
It's amazing.

962
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,680
The volleyball team
of Nara Girls' High School

963
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,560
stayed late to finish filming.

964
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,080
They want to keep the ball in the
air until the end, no matter what.

965
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,880
- On no!
- It's fine.

966
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,720
It's fine, it's stable.

967
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,040
- This isn't good.
- No, everything is fine.

968
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,360
You're doing great.

969
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,440
He's talking a lot.

970
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,480
Can Nakaoka finish the job?

971
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,520
What's up with his face?

972
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay!

973
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,720
Wait a minute. Slowly.
Let's calm down.

974
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,640
All right.

975
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,720
All right.

976
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,200
Come on!

977
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,280
You can do it.

978
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,160
Take it.

979
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
That way.

980
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,080
The ball goes to an unexpected
direction, but Kotona covers it.

981
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,240
Nakaoka has finished
putting on the jacket.

982
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,520
So it'll be a success if Nakaoka
can toss the ball at the end.

983
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
They're all great.

984
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,360
Yes, we did it!

985
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,720
At the end, it was just like
playing volleyball.

986
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,360
But Nakaoka and high school students
united together and did a great job.

987
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,600
Yes! We did it!

988
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,280
To the volleyball team
of Nara Girls' High School,

989
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,080
thank you very much!

990
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,880
Can we consider this a success?

991
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,080
I'm sure they all worked very hard.

992
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,880
But please don't play cool
in front of high school girls.

993
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,560
All right.

994
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,080
What's that face?

995
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,000
Let's do it.

996
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,240
See? He's trying to be cool.

997
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,480
He was, wasn't he?

998
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,920
That wasn't my intention.
I was just being serious.

999
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,880
After you spoke,
you made that sharp face.

1000
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,160
He really did.

1001
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,880
At the end,
when he was trying to look cool,

1002
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,200
though usually his hair looks messy,

1003
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,720
he tied his hair tightly in front
of high school girls.

1004
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,520
Very tightly.

1005
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,080
Like Antonio Banderas.

1006
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,680
That's exactly right.

1007
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,360
He usually never ties his hair
because it's very precious to him.

1008
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,160
- Because it makes people laugh.
- In front of high school girls,

1009
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,640
why didn't you eat bread too?

1010
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,280
I wanted you to eat it there too.

1011
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,480
In that part, I wanted
his hair to be messy.

1012
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,720
- That's not possible.
- I'm disappointed you tied it.

1013
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,880
He also had a nasty face
when it was about money.

1014
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,800
When he was catching bills.

1015
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
He really had a nasty face.

1016
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,800
With a grin.

1017
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,600
Wait, perhaps he's not
a top-class comedian.
