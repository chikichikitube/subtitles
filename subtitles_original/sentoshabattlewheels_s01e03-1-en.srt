1
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,950
The following program was produced with
the utmost consideration toward safety

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,385
and features dangerous activities which
were supervised by stunt professionals.

3
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,854
Do not attempt to reenact any
of the activities performed.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,530
Annihilate the opposition's battle cars.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,999
That is the aim for both Hamada's
and Junior's armies,

6
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,734
to decide whose army reigns supreme.

7
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:40,107
Junior's army won the first round
after storming back from the brink.

8
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:44,712
However, the true hell of battle
will only now be unleashed.

9
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,152
YOU MIGHT DIE, ROUND 2
THE ROAD TO HELL

10
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,953
You might die, round two.

11
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,722
The Road to Hell.

12
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,890
Road to Hell?

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,892
-You might die?
-I don't wanna die.

14
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:58,659
DANGER - DANGER - DANGER

15
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,630
Overcome various obstacles
and reach the finish line first.

16
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,933
All foot soldiers from both teams
will participate in this round.

17
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,103
The team with the best total time
will win.

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,105
The losing team will need to hand over

19
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,541
one of their battle cars
to the winning team.

20
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,044
START - GOAL

21
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,746
The total distance of this course
is one kilometer.

22
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,714
Two cars will start at the same time.

23
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,017
The car that finishes first, wins.

24
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,722
Right at the start of the course
is the Hell Slope,

25
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,492
a steep, 60-degree downhill slope.

26
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,395
At the bottom of that slope
is a narrow hairpin curve,

27
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,130
only wide enough to fit one car.

28
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,999
After the curve,

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,336
there is a short climb
up to a 50 centimeter jump zone.

30
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,140
After landing,

31
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:49,043
you must navigate through
a hellish 30-degree bank area.

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,578
THE 30-DEGREE BANK FROM HELL

33
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,980
Beyond that area, there is a sharp curve

34
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,416
made hellishly slippery by laying
metal plates across the area.

35
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,650
THE SHARP CURB WITH METAL PLATES FROM HELL

36
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,420
Then we come across the bumpy zone

37
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,555
with a series of logs
lined across the course.

38
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,857
THE LOG ROAD FROM HELL

39
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,159
Then comes the explosion area.

40
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,695
This is a dangerous area
where drivers won't know

41
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,530
when, where
or how large an explosion there will be.

42
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,731
THE EXPLOSION AREA FROM HELL

43
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,435
Then, the drivers must navigate past
the giant swinging stone

44
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,970
to reach the finish line.

45
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,205
"The Road to Hell Laws"

46
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,974
The team that finishes the race first
will be awarded points

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,776
according to the time difference
with their opponents.

48
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,180
If they win by one second,
the winner will be awarded one point.

49
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,683
Any time difference over ten seconds
will be awarded with ten points.

50
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:35,823
We'd like to see someone
do a test drive first.

51
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,226
-Yeah.
-We wanna see what's so hellish about it.

52
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,596
We can't compete just like that
after being told "you might die."

53
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,398
-It's scary.
-Hey, Junior.

54
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,699
Can you show us?

55
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,369
-Please show us.
-Please.

56
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,337
It's an obvious course!

57
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,906
-No.
-Just look at the course!

58
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,909
We wanna get feedback from someone
who's actually driven the course.

59
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,112
-It's pretty clear!
-It's not clear to us, Junior.

60
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,580
Come on, please show us.

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,716
Let's go, sir.

62
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,686
Our master, Mr. Test Pilot,
is going to show us how it's done.

63
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,956
-What are you talking about?
-Don't take it too seriously.

64
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,792
-Just give us the data.
-Don't think too much about it.

65
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,726
No, no, no!

66
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,762
-No, no, no!
-Don't be so reluctant.

67
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,731
Junior and I, we're the warlords.

68
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,366
You're going to show us
because you're our leader.

69
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,134
That's right.

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,804
If I knew this was going to happen,
I wouldn't have had ramen for lunch!

71
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,974
We don't know what
we're facing at this stage.

72
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,010
Let's get in.

73
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,113
What? Why me?

74
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,548
Thank you, sire!

75
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,085
Thank you!

76
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,522
I don't need a ride! I really don't.

77
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,892
-Go check out what hell looks like.
-This sucks!

78
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:50,064
-You're coming too, Seiko?
-They made me!

79
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,865
I'm so scared!

80
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,002
Now, the warlords from both armies

81
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,571
are going to inspect
the course themselves.

82
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,505
I don't see the need for us to do this.

83
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,808
Three... Two...

84
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,842
I'm so scared...

85
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,811
One... Go!

86
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,512
Each car is being driven by
professional race car drivers

87
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,214
from Takahashi Pro Racing.

88
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,016
Right after the start, they encounter
a sudden 60-degree drop

89
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,484
that has been dubbed, the Hell Hill,

90
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,353
as it will scare the daylights
out of anyone.

91
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,921
Before they can take a breath,
they come across the hairpin curve

92
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,823
barely wide enough for them to turn.

93
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,691
The trailing car can hardly see
what's ahead of them,

94
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,760
because of the dust cloud created by
the leading car.

95
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,430
One can use this strategy to
their advantage in the race.

96
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,233
Then comes the 50 cm jumping pass,

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,836
and the 30-degree bank
made just for this show.

98
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,272
And here's the slippery curve lined
with metal plates.

99
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,342
We expect a lot of accidents
to occur right here.

100
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,544
Now this is the bumpy log area,

101
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,480
where four-wheel drive vehicles
will have a distinct advantage.

102
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,915
As expected, this car is slipping
and sliding across the slippery area.

103
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:42,850
No, no, no!

104
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:50,391
Now, they've entered the explosive area.

105
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,795
No one knows when and where it'll happen,
or how big the explosion is going to be.

106
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,364
This is the main street
of the "Road to Hell."

107
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,033
They've bumped into each other!

108
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,769
Of course, you are allowed to
run into your opponent.

109
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,038
You're also allowed to cut off
your opponent.

110
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,806
The rock! The rock!

111
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,808
They've now passed the explosives area

112
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,110
and these giant rocks
are blocking their way.

113
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,179
Those who can overcome the fear of death

114
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,515
and keep accelerating,
will win this battle.

115
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,785
That is the "Road to Hell"!

116
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,086
We finished first!

117
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,254
They've finished.

118
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,122
Are you okay, Mr. Hamada?

119
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,557
Mr. Hamada?

120
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,225
Are you okay?

121
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,397
-Mr. Hamada!
-Are you okay?

122
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,202
Are you okay, Junior?

123
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,574
Mr. Hamada, are you okay?

124
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,410
-Are you okay?
-He's dead!

125
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:44,778
It's so dusty!

126
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,547
He's dying!

127
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,149
-Are you okay?
-He's dying!

128
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,718
He's dying!

129
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,086
-What's wrong?
-Junior?

130
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,821
Princess? Master and Princess!

131
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,556
Junior!

132
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,458
They're so dusty!

133
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,827
Are you okay?

134
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,228
What happened to you?

135
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,364
He's going to throw up.

136
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,999
The ramen's going to come out!

137
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,601
How are you?

138
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,503
Is it frightening?

139
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,637
It's really scary...

140
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,907
The first slope downhill is like, boom!

141
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:18,245
Then you go careening around the corner,
and suddenly, you see nothing!

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,414
It's such a big drop!

143
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,283
-And you went down pretty fast, too.
-It's that scary right from the beginning?

144
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,519
Can we even race this course?

145
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,154
We're going to drive, right?

146
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,789
-We can...
-Can we sit in the passenger's seat?

147
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,257
-We can't.
-Impossible.

148
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,392
You can do it. Just try to
get in each other's way.

149
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,193
Yeah.

150
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,062
"Sentosha Laws" - Battle 1, Battle 2,
Battle 3: Scramble over battle cars

151
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,064
The battle will consist of four rounds.

152
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,665
For the first three rounds,

153
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,435
both armies will battle to win over
the opponent's car.

154
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,839
The winning team can select one car
from the losing team to join their army.

155
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,976
For the fourth and final round,
the remaining cars will battle each other

156
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,978
until one team has no cars remaining.

157
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,047
The team with more cars left
at the start of the final round

158
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,383
will have a distinct advantage
in the battle.

159
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,317
Battle 4: Wipe out opposing army
with your remaining cars

160
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,587
In the first round,
Junior's army drew first blood.

161
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,556
First Round - Junior's Victory

162
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,859
Harada's result, wow, one centimeter!

163
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,461
Yes!

164
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,796
Junior's army was able to gain
the Nissan Fairlady Z from Hamada's army.

165
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:09,797
9 versus 7

166
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,100
The current state of play is
Junior's army with nine battle cars,

167
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,002
versus Hamada's army with seven.

168
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,073
The next battle starts now.

169
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,746
First Battle

170
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,681
-Hey, Junior!
-Yes?

171
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,717
-Can I give you a suggestion?
-Yes?

172
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,954
You know, we lost the last battle.

173
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,289
Yeah.

174
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,159
-Hey!
-Show some respect!

175
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,128
He's suddenly very arrogant!

176
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,831
-What's wrong with you?
-You're too good for us now?

177
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,665
It's strange.

178
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,735
I want to suggest that we keep
the same match ups from the last round.

179
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,372
What?

180
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,408
We want the same match ups,
but we want to win this time.

181
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,676
-Yeah!
-We want revenge!

182
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,177
We want to avenge our loss.

183
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,179
Well...

184
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,681
All right, whatevs.

185
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,284
You're disrespecting us again!

186
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,254
Then you're up first, Akina!

187
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,155
Yay!

188
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,524
-Remember she crashed into you last time!
-Watch out for Akina!

189
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,326
You can't let her push you around!

190
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,260
She'll try to ram me again, won't she?

191
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,062
Then I'm going to run from her.

192
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,196
Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Kompressor
New car price approx. 4.8 million yen

193
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,399
The evil angel who never decelerates,
Akina Minami.

194
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,770
Her battle car is
a Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Kompressor.

195
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,005
Engine 2.3L I4 DOHC Super Charger /
197 hp / FR / AT / Weight 1380 kg

196
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,240
Nissan Fuga
New car price approx. 5.7 million yen

197
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,210
Amagasaki's reckless magical girl,
Nagisa from Amako Inter.

198
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,479
Her battle car is her own Nissan Fuga,

199
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,948
which she still hasn't paid off
the loan for yet.

200
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,149
Engine 3.5L V6 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 1680kg

201
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,351
Go!

202
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,286
In the first round,

203
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,520
THE FIRST ROUND
STOP RIGHT AT THE EDGE

204
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,957
Akina tried to damage the Fuga
rather than trying to win the match.

205
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,794
Wow, Akina seems to only
care about attacking the Fuga.

206
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,596
The winner is Nagisa!

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,432
The second round of the grudge match
is about to begin.

208
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,568
What will be the fate of the Nissan Fuga?

209
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,636
She crashed into me!

210
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,907
Next, in the fierce battle between
Hamada's and Junior's armies.

211
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,775
You Might Die, Round 2.

212
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,344
This round is a timed race through
the "Road to Hell" course.

213
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,448
Driving for Junior's army is Akina Minami
in the red Mercedes.

214
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,052
And in the white Nissan Fuga
that still hasn't been paid off yet

215
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,154
is Nagisa from Hamada's army.

216
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,122
Hey, Nagisa.

217
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,791
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can.

218
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,894
-You beat her to a pulp!
-Yes, sir!

219
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,098
She already attacked you once.
Make sure you pay her back, okay?

220
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,200
Yes. I'll get into the zone.

221
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,270
He's telling me to smash her car.

222
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,838
I told him I don't want to damage my car,
but Hamada's telling me to attack.

223
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,274
Sorry to keep you waiting!

224
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,111
-You're late!
-I'm sorry...

225
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,513
Don't touch my car!

226
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,581
-Don't touch my car.
-Why?

227
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,417
I don't want my car to get damaged!

228
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,085
It was only a scratch last time,

229
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,354
but I'll ensure I make
a big dent this time!

230
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,422
She's totally crazy.

231
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,325
Isn't this fun?

232
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
Akina, how are you feeling?

233
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,867
I'm so excited, I'm looking forward to it!

234
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,703
You go for it, okay?

235
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,439
I will. I'm going to make a dent
in her car this time.

236
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,040
Okay.

237
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,009
Akina Minami
(Mercedes-Benz SLK Kompressor)

238
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,477
vs Nagisa from Amako Inter (Nissan Fuga)

239
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,779
I think Akina's going to attack
right from the outset.

240
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,748
Yeah, I think so too.

241
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,951
-I'll beat you to a pulp!
-Me too!

242
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,820
Shut up!

243
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,191
They're already trash talking!

244
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,760
"I'll beat you to a pulp!"
"Me too!"

245
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:32,099
You can go ahead. Because it's dangerous.

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,068
You just want to rear-end me!

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,004
No, you can go in front.

248
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,739
What is wrong with her?

249
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,477
Three... Two... One...

250
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,445
Go!

251
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,180
The battle between the two women
starts now!

252
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,416
As expected, Akina's giving Nagisa
the front position.

253
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,817
Nagisa is the one that starts first.

254
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,352
Can she keep this front position
to the end?

255
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,921
She's attacked from the rear!
Just as expected!

256
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:59,593
Akina totally rear-ended her!
She's laughing!

257
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,696
Wow, that's so dangerous!

258
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:08,235
Now, through this smoke-like dust,
the small red Mercedes tries to catch up.

259
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,772
The back of the Fuga
is still under attack!

260
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,173
What is wrong with her!

261
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,541
Amazing!

262
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,278
Stop hitting me from behind! Seriously!

263
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,579
She's pushing her.

264
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,651
You can hardly see anything
on this dusty road

265
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,154
but the white Fuga...
And there's an explosion!

266
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,490
That's right, we don't know when
the explosions are going to come.

267
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,092
Akina's right behind her!

268
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,361
It's tail to nose!
They're actually touching!

269
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,797
Akina's pushing her!

270
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,432
They've gotten through
the slippery area unscathed.

271
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,034
Now they drive along
this bumpy path with logs.

272
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,104
Akina pushes Nagisa out of the way
and takes the lead!

273
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,406
Now, it's a straight line to the finish!

274
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,809
-She's reversing, she's reversing!
-No, no, no!

275
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,713
Wait, she stopped.
Akina has stopped her car.

276
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,884
She's reversing!
Nagisa crashes into her!

277
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,787
Nagisa crashes into her!

278
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,490
Nagisa crashes into her!

279
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,724
This is quite amazing.

280
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,028
Even though this is a timed race,
they're busy crashing into each other.

281
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,497
Akina's goggles have fallen off!
Is she okay?

282
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,898
That was a big impact.

283
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,433
It made a big crash noise!

284
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,735
Are you kidding?

285
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:20,240
Akina only seems to be interested in
damaging each other's cars.

286
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,576
Go, Nagisa!

287
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,278
I can't see.

288
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:30,183
Akina can't see anything
because of the smoke from the explosions.

289
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:35,422
Akina's coming up to the giant rock
swinging back and forth across the course.

290
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,426
How is she going?
She avoids the rock and accelerates!

291
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:44,030
She accelerates into the finish.
Akina wins!

292
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,067
Akina's time is 1 minute 55 seconds.
The winner is Junior's army.

293
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,737
Nagisa from Amako Inter
will follow her to the finish.

294
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,074
Wow, the front of the Fuga
is completely smashed!

295
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,475
WINNER
Akina Minami - 1m55s

296
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,910
Akina Minami - 1m55s - +10p
Nagisa from Amako Inter - 2m06s

297
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,812
She bumps into Akina at the finish!

298
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,546
Hey!

299
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,815
The battle is over!

300
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,850
Yeah!

301
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,319
Yes!

302
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,121
Well done!

303
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,324
Well...

304
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,559
That was so much fun!

305
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,230
Wow!

306
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,669
It's more damaged than I imagined!

307
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,071
That's how it ends up looking
when you crash like that.

308
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,040
She got reversed onto from the side.

309
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,042
Then crashed into Akina at the end.

310
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,246
Thank you very much!

311
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,182
Why, you!

312
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,117
Shit!

313
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,754
What the hell were you thinking?

314
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,156
Sorry, I didn't think it would be
this bad.

315
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,025
Are you kidding me?

316
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,660
I got overexcited.

317
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,995
I told you I wanted to go home!

318
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,431
That I didn't want the pay
for doing this show!

319
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,900
Let me go home!

320
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,102
I had a lot of fun. Thank you so much!

321
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,539
Akina fuels Nagisa's anger again.

322
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,374
Nagisa is furious.

323
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,410
Let's have a look at the replay.

324
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:05,946
SENTOSHA: Battle Wheels

325
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,581
Go!

326
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,284
Here's the start. As she declared earlier,
Akina lets Nagisa go ahead.

327
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,589
It seemed fine at first,
but Akina took aim here.

328
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,691
Akina keeps nudging from behind.

329
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,926
Nagisa becomes very flustered
at this stage.

330
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,063
With a wide grin on her face,
Akina pushes Nagisa from behind.

331
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,266
That's why they call Akina
the dangerous speed queen.

332
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,702
Behind the wheel, Akina's personality
completely changes.

333
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,470
She's nudging Nagisa here as well.

334
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,871
You can hear her laughing.

335
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,076
They somehow manage to maintain
control through this area.

336
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,180
And here it seemed
Akina made a great maneuver

337
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,449
and would head straight
to the finish line.

338
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,817
But she stopped.

339
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,820
She stopped and reversed!

340
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,023
Akina intentionally reverses into Nagisa.

341
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,293
This is where the damage
to the right front bumper happened.

342
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:57,230
It's a win for Akina.
Now, how is Nagisa's car?

343
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,165
Is the Fuga okay?

344
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,668
You were great.

345
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,435
Looks like you had fun.

346
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,671
-You looked confident out there.
-Thank you.

347
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,839
It was so much fun!

348
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,707
I had a lot of fun!

349
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,144
What were you thinking when you
reversed and crashed into her?

350
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,215
Well, since I had leeway, I thought
that one little bump wasn't enough!

351
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,050
I see.

352
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,753
Shall we let Nagisa go home now?

353
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,955
I guess so.

354
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,189
How did it go?

355
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,993
I didn't sign up for this.
Let me go home!

356
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,062
Are you sure?

357
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,666
Don't you think you should stay
until you get her back for this?

358
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,468
My car will stop working if I keep going.

359
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,003
Your car's beeping.

360
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,672
It sustained a lot of damage.

361
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,075
Second Battle

362
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,246
Let's go, Fujimoto!

363
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,581
-It's your turn, Seiji!
-This is a good match.

364
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,250
I'll batter your car to pieces!

365
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,986
Just like your face!

366
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:57,791
Volvo V70

367
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,661

no action, Toshifumi Fujimoto.

368
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,297
His battle car is a Volvo V70.

371
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,636
The Chihara family's mad dog,
Seiji Chihara.

372
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,472
His battle car is a Toyota Celsior.

373
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,673
Engine 4.3L V8 DOHC / 280 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 1800kg

374
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,175
In the first round,

375
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,277
Seiji managed to stop the car
just 80 centimeters

376
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,846
from the wall,
to give Hamada's army a great start.

377
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,081
HAMADA ARMY'S MAD DOG
SEIJI CHIHARA

378
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,453
Fujimoto, on the other hand, is known
to be a scaredy-cat comedian.

379
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,487
The Junior's Army's Man of just words,
no action, Toshifumi Fujimoto

380
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,857
Can he bring a good result
for Junior's army in this second round?

381
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,058
Smash him, okay?

382
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,760
Leave it to me.

383
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,798
I have a perfect image
of what I'll do to him.

384
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,267
Fujimoto's a scaredy-cat.
Go beat him up, okay?

385
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,335
Yes.

386
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,704
I'm sorry.

387
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,707
I'm going to beat up
your own brother.

388
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:48,742
No problem.

389
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,877
-Are you okay with that?
-Yup. No problem.

390
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,779
Good. Now I have permission
from the little brother.

391
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,513
Yeah.

392
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,448
Toshifumi Fujimoto (Volvo V70)
vs Seiji Chihara (Toyota Celsior)

393
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,283
Now, we're onto the second match up.

394
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,119
In the white Volvo
is just words, no action, Fujimoto.

395
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,788
And in the black Toyota Celsior
is the Chihara family's mad dog,

396
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,022
Seiji Chihara.

397
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,425
He betrayed his brother
to join Hamada's army.

398
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,026
Three... Two...

399
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,862
Let's go, Fujimoto!

400
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,296
Let's go, Seiji!

401
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,564
One...

402
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,266
Go!

403
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,034
Here's the start.
They bump each other from the start!

404
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:19,005
Seiji is already pushing! Can they get
through the gate? They managed somehow.

405
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,974
They go on the attack!

406
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,911
Seiji blows up a dust storm
and Fujimoto has no vision whatsoever!

407
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,180
He blocked Fujimoto's vision
with the dust!

408
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,984
Fujimoto can't see...
And he's attacked from behind!

409
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:35,188
Seiji has gone full attack mode
on Fujimoto.

410
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,389
Run, run!

411
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,224
That's why he's called the mad dog
of the family.

412
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,593
Seiji hits him at the top
of the hairpin curve.

413
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:44,864
He intentionally follows Fujimoto
and attacks him from behind!

414
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,033
Seiji seems out of control.

415
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,769
The Volvo V70 is Volvo's
first four-wheel drive model.

416
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,905
These rugged tracks
are causing no problems for this car.

417
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,974
What's happened to Seiji? He's stuck!

418
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,945
The wheels are spinning like crazy.

419
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,780
-You're doing well!
-You're in front!

420
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,315
Run!

421
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,783
In the meantime, Fujimoto opens up
a gap at the front.

422
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,186
Fujimoto has the lead,
but he's driving steadily.

423
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,754
Fujimoto's known for being
a bit of a chicken,

424
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,022
and he's not taking any chances here.

425
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,391
And here comes Seiji!

426
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,760
Wow, Seiji's catching up to him!

427
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,529
Fujimoto's driving steadily
here and there goes Seiji!

428
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,765
Seiji has caught up!

429
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,934
He's attacking relentlessly from behind!

430
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,770
The battle cars are ferociously jostling
for position.

431
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,839
Oh, the car has spun around!

432
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,275
The battle cars are ferociously jostling
for position.

433
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,344
Oh, the car has spun around!

434
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,948
The battle cars are ferociously jostling
for position.

435
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,883
Oh, the car has spun around!

436
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,019
Now Seiji is blocking his way.

437
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,793
Go, Fujimoto!

438
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,861
Let's go!

439
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:52,365
Now, Seiji is out to ruin Fujimoto's car.

440
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,370
You can hear the horn.
There's another impact!

441
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,574
Mad dog Seiji is going on
an all-out attack!

442
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,712
Fujimoto is through!
He managed to get away.

443
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,082
But he can't raise his speed.
There's another explosion!

444
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,684
And another one! Fujimoto is terrified!

445
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,188
This is an area where it's hard
to speed up. It's getting tight!

446
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,191
Seiji passes on the inside!

447
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,193
Now Seiji is in front!

448
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,261
Get him!

449
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,931
Fujimoto is coming up from behind.
There's a massive rock in their way.

450
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,900
They have managed to avoid...

451
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,635
No, it hit Fujimoto!

452
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,503
And here, Seiji completes the race.

453
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,805
Seiji from Hamada's army
has claimed victory!

454
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,140
WINNER
Seiji Chihara - 2m02s

455
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,709
The winner is Hamada's army.

456
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,013
Well done!

457
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,083
Fujimoto, while late, has also crossed
the finish line.

458
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,985
What are you doing?

459
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,053
The winner is Seiji!

460
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:53,259
You've lost two in a row to Seiji now.

461
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,930
Seiji Chihara - 2m02s - +3p
Toshifumi Fujimoto - 2m05s

462
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,098
Yeah.

463
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,667
Two in a row!

464
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,369
Two in a row!

465
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,073
Shit!

466
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,408
Two in a row!

467
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,077
SENTOSHA

468
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,745
Go!

469
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,581
Now Seiji has won two races
in a row against Fujimoto.

470
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,184
Right from the outset,
he shows us his mad dog qualities.

471
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,553
He was already attacking
even before the start.

472
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,690
Due to this dust storm created by Seiji,

473
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,992
Fujimoto is too scared
to put the pedal down.

474
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,729
And here, Seiji catches up
from behind and...

475
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,931
It looks like he's bullying Fujimoto.

476
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,267
A battle car is bullying
another battle car.

477
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,372
And here, Seiji nudges Fujimoto
from behind and spins him around.

478
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,212
Yeah!

479
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,614
You were great out there.

480
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,583
What happened to you?

481
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,251
What were you doing?

482
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,020
You were ahead in the beginning.

483
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,888
You're nearly in tears. What's up?

484
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,256
I apologize!

485
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,494
Third Battle

486
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:02,862
I'll go next.

487
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,464
-I have a plan.
-Okay.

488
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,033
If he tries to bump into me,
I'll run away from him.

489
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,835
-Right.
-Do your best!

490
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:09,969
-Good luck!
-Okay.

491
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:10,703
I'm off!

492
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,605
I'll go and shut him up.

493
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,540
-Yeah!
-Beat him up.

494
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,209
He chirps a lot
and it's getting annoying.

495
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,577
Wish me luck!

496
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,078
Good luck!

497
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,013
Jaguar XJ Executive
New car price approx. 8.1 million yen

498
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,250
The Rock 'n' Rolling speedster,
Mitsuru Matsuoka.

499
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,353
His battle car is a Jaguar XJ Executive.

500
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,688
Engine 4.0L V8 DOHC / 243 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 1730kg

501
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:29,656
He will drive Takahashi Racing's Toyota
Verossa, used for stunt car practice.

502
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,392
The man who wears shorts all year round,
Kunikazu Katsumata.

503
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,294
Since Hamada's army lost the first round,

504
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,463
his Fairlady Z was taken by Junior's army
at the end of the round.

505
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,600
He will compete in this round
using an alternative vehicle.

506
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,001
Go!

507
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,302
In the first round,

508
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,304
Katsumata won this by adopting
a superior strategy,

509
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,874
where he agitated Matsuoka
into making a mistake.

510
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,208
Maybe he's going too fast?

511
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,843
They're up to the braking line.
They're stopping...

512
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,911
Matsuoka's doing well...

513
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,613
No, he's falling through
to the other side. Look out!

514
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,349
No, he fell down the cliff!

515
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,517
Just as planned!

516
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,485
Just as planned!

517
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,789
You're driving an alternative vehicle,
right?

518
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,490
Yeah, that's right.

519
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,959
I don't think I can accelerate too much
with this.

520
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,896
Is that okay? If you want to forfeit
the race, it's fine.

521
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,930
HAMADA'S ARMY 3P
JUNIOR'S ARMY 10P

522
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,398
In the last round, I got too angry

523
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,266
THE MAN WHO WEARS SHORTS ALL-YEAR-ROUND
KUNIKAZU KATSUMATA

524
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,802
and got drawn into Katsumata's strategy.

525
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:16,769
THE ROCK'N'ROLL SPEEDSTER
MITSURU MATSUOKA

526
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,838
This time, I'll use that anger
to my advantage.

527
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:23,209
All of Japan should be on board
with this kind of show.

528
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,746
A daily show with battle cars?

529
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,347
Yeah, we should have it daily.

530
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,949
Yeah, a daily show.

531
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,418
-You lost your match in the last round.
-I know.

532
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,153
You need to do better this time.

533
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,690
I'll pummel him this time.
He's also driving a replacement car, so...

534
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,492
I think he'll be lacking in power anyway.

535
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,226
Okay.

536
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,395
I think I'll get that car
ready for the junkyard.

537
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,730
All right!

538
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,934
I'm a car enthusiast rocker.
I won't let him disrespect me again.

539
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,170
I'll go full throttle from the beginning
and I won't let him catch me.

540
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,872
All right. Understood.

541
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,609
Mitsuru Matsuoka (Jaguar XJ Executive)
vs Kunikazu Katsumata (replacement car)

542
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,212
With his Fairlady Z in the hands
of Junior's army,

543
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,147
Katsumata has been forced to drive
a replacement car he hasn't driven before.

544
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,248
On the other hand,

545
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,551
Matsuoka is driving a Jaguar favored
by the British royal family.

546
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:06,719
The difference is clear to see.

547
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:07,453
Go!

548
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,454
Here's the start.

549
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,156
Katsumata has taken the lead
from the outset.

550
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,457
Katsumata is in front.

551
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:15,027
He got an amazing start!
He sprints through the explosion.

552
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,730
The race on the "Road to Hell" course
has started.

553
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,031
This uphill section leads
up to the hairpin curve.

554
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,467
Matsuoka hits him from behind!

555
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,570
Matsuoka's Jaguar is on the attack!

556
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,907
Katsumata has lost control here.
So too has Matsuoka!

557
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:32,011
Both cars have lost their balance
and are now stuck.

558
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:33,980
No!

559
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,214
No, no, no!

560
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:36,849
Get out of there.

561
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,252
He spun out. They've both spun.

562
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,053
Can they get back on track?

563
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,589
Matsuoka is...

564
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,291
Is he going off course?

565
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,694
Looks like Katsumata is going get back
on track first.

566
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,064
Matsuoka does a big U-turn
before he gets back on track.

567
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,432
And here

568
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,435
Katsumata takes the lead again.

569
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,437
He's driving a replacement car,
but showing very good control.

570
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,275
Now he's driving along the bank
at a steep angle.

571
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,075
He's at the slippery area.

572
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:06,379
Matsuoka's Jaguar is still nowhere
to be seen.

573
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,115
Look at that. The front of the Jaguar
is falling apart!

574
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:11,484
The front of Matsuoka's car is damaged.

575
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,288
No, he's getting away!

576
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:17,590
Why has he stopped?

577
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,791
What is that?

578
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:23,696
He stopped. Katsumata has stopped.

579
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:27,600
He reverses and hits Matsuoka!

580
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,370
But Matsuoka has used this
to his advantage and has taken the lead!

581
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,406
Matsuoka is in front.

582
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:37,910
Will Katsumata regret
stopping to hit Matsuoka earlier?

583
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,046
This is Matsuoka's big chance!

584
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,150
Matsuoka is in front,
but he's being pushed from behind.

585
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:47,753
He's pushing and pushing!
Someone has lost control there.

586
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,856
Coming out from the cloud of smoke is...

587
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:50,790
It's Katsumata!

588
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,592
Katsumata's car is in the lead.

589
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,228
He's controlling
the replacement car very well.

590
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,863
And we're up to the giant rock.

591
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,266
Can he avoid the rock?
He gets hit, but it doesn't affect him.

592
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:03,069
He gets the other rock out of his way.

593
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,272
The winner is Katsumata
from Hamada's army!

594
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:06,939
It was a great performance
in a replacement car.

595
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,908
Hamada's army wins.

596
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,811
WINNER
Kunikazu Katsumata - 1m31s

597
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,412
He was great!

598
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,347
Well done!

599
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:17,850
Matsuoka crosses the finish line now.
How is the Jaguar?

600
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,685
It has sustained a lot of damage.

601
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,188
Kunikazu Katsumata - 1m31s - +10p
Mitsuru Matsuoka - 1m41s

602
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,991
-The dust blocking your view...
-Right.

603
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,192
...is causing more problems
than we thought.

604
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:26,993
You can't see anything.

605
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,495
Yes!

606
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,831
-I can't open the door.
-The door won't open?

607
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,967
Did your window shatter?

608
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,238
Here are some parts from the Jaguar.

609
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,108
Wait a second.

610
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,911
The Jaguar looks nothing like
before the race.

611
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,580
It definitely won't take any
further part in this competition.

612
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:50,650
Let's have a look at the replay.

613
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:52,585
SENTOSHA

614
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,655
Here's the replay.

615
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,423
Katsumata went in front.

616
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,293
Then, from here,

617
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,562
Matsuoka started attacking
with the front of his Jaguar.

618
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,431
They both lose control right here.

619
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,533
We saw many instances like this.

620
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,337
This is what battle cars do.

621
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,975
Matsuoka in his Jaguar was well behind.

622
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,744
The Jaguar was already
falling apart at this stage.

623
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,915
Matsuoka somehow regains control
of the unstable Jaguar.

624
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,718
After this point, Katsumata is waiting
for Matsuoka

625
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:26,953
just so he can ram him.

626
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,487
This is where Katsumata hit Matsuoka.

627
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:33,326
But through this, Matsuoka was able to
take the lead in the Jaguar.

628
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,628
The Rock 'n' Rolling speedster
is in front,

629
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,564
however, the man who wears
shorts all year round is closing in.

630
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,835
Matsuoka loses control here again.

631
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:46,505
Katsumata is very aware of
what's happening around him.

632
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,175
Up against the world-famous Jaguar,

633
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:52,712
Katsumata was able to show some
wonderful skills in this race.

634
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,780
Hey!

635
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:55,848
Matsuoka!

636
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,550
Mr. Matsuoka from Sophia!

637
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,218
Sorry.

638
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,153
Mr. Matsuoka from the band SOPHIA!

639
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,556
I apologize!

640
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,057
What?

641
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,028
You like cars, don't you?

642
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,630
You can't lose to a man like Katsumata.

643
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,733
Didn't you go off course for a moment?

644
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,401
Yes!

645
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,204
It was a battle.

646
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,538
It was a big battle!

647
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,540
It went well.

648
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,743
-Well done!
-You were amazing.

649
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,612
I wanted to get as big a gap as possible,
but I couldn't help but smash him once.

650
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,580
That's right!

651
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:31,350
His car door won't open anymore.

652
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,119
I never felt like losing.

653
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,723
I never thought you would be
such an aggressive person!

654
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,091
Hamada's army - 13 points
Junior's army - 10 points

655
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,029
After three matches, Hamada's army is
leading by three points.

656
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,798
But they cannot rest easy
with their three-point lead,

657
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,967
as the "Road to Hell" is very challenging.

658
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,071
Fourth Battle

659
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:53,606
Nissan Skyline
New car price 3.1 million yen

660
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,908
The best driver in a thousand years
according to himself,

661
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,243
Juichi Wakisaka.

662
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,645
His battle car is a Nissan Skyline.

663
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,747
Modified to suit hooligans
from Chiba and Ibaraki,

664
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,315
it features a muffler
made out of bamboo spears.

665
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,617
Engine 2.5L I6 DOHC / 200 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 1400kg

666
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:05,418
BMW 330i
New car price approx. 5.7 million yen

667
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,587
The current top racing driver,
Shigekazu Wakisaka.

668
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,558
His battle car is the BMW 330i
from Germany.

669
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,360
Engine 3L I6 DOHC / 231 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 1520kg

670
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,761
In the first round,

671
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,064
the younger brother Shigekazu
claimed a clear-cut victory.

672
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,165
THE FIRST ROUND
STOP RIGHT AT THE EDGE

673
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,868
He was able to work off his long-standing
grudge as a race car driver.

674
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,904
How did they do?
Shigekazu has done really well!

675
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,839
Shigekazu has won by a clear margin.

676
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,008
What happened to Juichi?

677
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,776
Shigekazu's result is one meter.

678
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:34,980
In contrast, Juichi has only recorded
8 meters, 90 centimeters!

679
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,349
So scary.

680
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,318
On to the fourth battle.

681
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,687
Hamada's army currently leads
by three points.

682
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,156
Family warfare between two brothers,

683
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,692
race car drivers Juichi and Shigekazu
will battle each other once again.

684
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:52,031
Juichi is known as Mr. GT in Japan
with his unmatched record.

685
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:56,102
Now he also manages a Super GT team.

686
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,839
Although Shigekazu is less well-known
compared to his brother,

687
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,741
he's still one of Japan's top racers.

688
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,243
Thank you very much.

689
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,418
Hey, Mr. Wakisaka.

690
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,020
-Let's beat the other Wakisaka, okay?
-Yes.

691
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,590
I've been suffering in his shadow
for a long time,

692
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,526
since I started racing at 17.
Today, I'll get my revenge.

693
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,896
You're going to make him suffer?

694
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,298
-Let's go, Wakisaka!
-Yes.

695
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,501
Juichi Wakisaka (BMW 330i)
vs Shigekazu Wakisaka (Nissan Skyline)

696
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,436
Shigekazu has been trying to outdo
his older brother for a very long time.

697
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,672
He has often only been
referred to as Juichi's little brother.

698
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,741
Can he claim two victories in a row?

699
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,977
Three... Two... One...

700
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:39,778
Go!

701
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,213
Here they go!

702
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,683
They are side by side
passing the gate at the start.

703
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,688
The older brother takes the lead here.
Juichi currently in front.

704
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,657
They look calm and collected
at this stage.

705
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,259
In this cloud of dust,

706
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,960
the younger Wakisaka
is right behind his brother.

707
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,830
They have yet to crash
or bump into each other yet.

708
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,500
They're using their driving
techniques to outdo each other.

709
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,636
Here comes Shigekazu on the inside.
They are side by side.

710
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,437
They are side by side!

711
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,140
-It's like a proper race.
-Awesome.

712
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:12,545
They drive across the bank still
side by side.

713
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:15,648
Is Shigekazu in front?
No, still Juichi in front.

714
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,416
Now, Shigekazu takes the lead.

715
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,685
Shigekazu is half a car length in front.

716
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,488
-What's that?
-What's going on?

717
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,924
Is Juichi coming back at him?

718
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,426
Who are they? They're ninjas!

719
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,863
The Ninjas line up and throw paint balls
at them!

720
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,998
They are getting covered in paint balls!

721
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,099
The paint is blocking their view.
They can't see what's in front of them!

722
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,068
What the... I can't see!

723
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,871
They lose their vision
and here's an explosion!

724
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,907
Who will emerge from beyond all the smoke?
It's the BMW!

725
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,410
Shigekazu, the little brother,
is still in front!

726
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,446
Where is his brother? Where is Juichi?

727
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,815
There he is! They are side by side!

728
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,052
They are, again, driving side by side.

729
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:56,889
Juichi takes the lead in the left corner.

730
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,357
He made a pass!

731
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,960
-Such a good battle. Let's go!
-Come on!

732
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:05,864
Juichi is in front.
The giant rock swings by.

733
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:09,201
Is it Juichi or Shigekazu?
They are side by side.

734
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,270
They finish together!

735
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,038
Who crossed the line first?
It's too close to call!

736
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:13,772
Did I win?

737
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,040
Who won?

738
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,709
The winner is Hamada's army!

739
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,911
Juichi wins! The gap is just 0.1 seconds!

740
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,045
WINNER
Juichi Wakisaka - 1m05s

741
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,747
Yeah!

742
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:24,049
Juichi Wakisaka - 1m05s - +1p
Shigekazu Wakisaka - 1m05s

743
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,118
-Yes!
-Amazing!

744
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,987
-It's a matter of millimeters!
-He won by a nose!

745
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,288
-Who won?
-Did we lose?

746
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,356
We lost?

747
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,291
So close.

748
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:33,592
SENTOSHA

749
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:37,429
Let's go through the replay.
This was a wonderful match up.

750
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,033
This was a great race between
two professional race car drivers.

751
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:44,637
They drive side by side without touching.

752
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,605
They showed us what
top-class racing is all about.

753
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:49,141
Here they are side by side again.
Shigekazu is in the lead.

754
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,745
Juichi is right behind.

755
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,948
They encounter an unexpected
attack by the ninja paint brigade.

756
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,450
This paint ball attack
takes them by surprise.

757
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:02,254
Although their views get blocked
by the paint on their windscreens,

758
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,922
they were still able to give us
a close race

759
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,025
with less than one second between them.

760
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,695
First one to come out of
the smoke was Shigekazu,

761
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,199
but Juichi is also just on the other side.

762
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,102
Juichi takes the lead from his brother
and wins the race.

763
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:18,637
SENTOSHA

764
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,105
I won, didn't I?

765
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,140
I won?

766
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,141
You won one point.

767
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:24,743
You gained one point.

768
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,545
I won, right?

769
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:30,115
All right!

770
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,183
Yay!

771
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,018
Thank you very much.

772
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,420
You won like a pro.

773
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,855
I'm sorry.

774
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,223
It was a great race.

775
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,592
There are a lot of guys who you don't know

776
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,028
whether they're working with you
or against you.

777
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,863
Are they friends or foes?

778
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:47,232
They're a bit of both, really.

779
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,736
They got me right in the face
with a paintball.

780
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,538
They really did.

781
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:55,407
Fifth Battle

782
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,442
Mercedes-Benz S320
New car price approx. 10 million yen

783
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,345
Riding the Reaper's Express,
Toshiyuki Itakura.

784
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,414
His battle car is a Mercedes-Benz S320
from Germany.

785
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,316
Engine 3.2L V6 SOHC / 224 hp / FR / AT /
Weight 1800kg

786
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,317
Nissan Laurel 2000SGX
New car price 1.03 million yen

787
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:08,687
The man who nearly united Kyushu,
Masaki Sata.

788
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,890
His battle car is his beloved
Nissan Laurel 2000SGX.

789
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,959
Engine 2L I6
SOHC / 130 hp / FR / 5MT / Weight 1200kg

790
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,628
It's a legendary car highly sought after
by vintage car enthusiasts.

791
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,398
I know it's extremely uncool to do this...

792
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,867
But please excuse me from this race.
I'm sorry!

793
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,402
-What?
-Mr. Hamada!

794
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,404
This isn't like you.

795
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,606
My car is different to the others.

796
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,210
Other cars can be brought back
to their previous condition

797
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,746
if you have the money.
My car can't be repaired!

798
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:34,980
Go buy a brand new car!

799
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,282
Brand new ones have lots
of parts available.

800
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,817
I want this car!

801
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,186
I only want this car.

802
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,422
This car is extremely rare.
There's only a few left in Japan.

803
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:44,390
I drive cars for a living.

804
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,325
From my point of view,
if we lose this car to the scrap heap,

805
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,927
that means it will be a step towards
that car not existing anymore.

806
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,362
Produced between 1972 and 1977,
only 30 of these cars still exist

807
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:51,096
That's one thing you should think about.

808
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,999
You're speaking from a car professional's
point of view.

809
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,301
Please, Mr. Hamada,
it's a Japanese treasure!

810
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,538
That car is a priceless aspect
of Japan's car culture.

811
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,206
You think it's worth saving?

812
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,207
I think so.

813
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,209
If we damage that car,

814
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,711
you'll receive so many complaints
from vintage car enthusiasts!

815
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:07,079
Please, Mr. Hamada.

816
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:11,884
Of course, we were expecting this.
So we have another plan.

817
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,818
Is that right?

818
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,620
Please have a look at this video.

819
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,991
Hi, this is Koji Kato,
a ninja from Hamada's army.

820
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,092
A NINJA FROM THE HAMADA ARMY
KOJI KATO

821
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,896
I understand that you're short
on battle cars.

822
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,166
I was thinking what we could do.

823
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,368
On this occasion,

824
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:32,004
I hear that you were letting
my comedy partner,

825
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,939
Yamamoto, appear on the show.

826
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:38,177
It took Yamamoto ten years
to get back on screen.

827
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,114
We caused a lot of trouble for our agency,
Yoshimoto Creative Agency.

828
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,216
Of course, we caused a lot of trouble
for Mr. Hamada, too.

829
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:48,520
Since it's for Mr. Hamada,
we must lend a hand.

830
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:49,455
What?

831
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,824
We can provide you
with a Volkswagen Beetle.

832
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,492
-What?
-Yes.

833
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,927
Do what you like with it.

834
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,361
Wait a minute.

835
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,096
I don't care what happens to it.

836
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:02,334
It's Mr. Yamamoto's car, after all.

837
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:09,208
I hear that Yamamoto has less than
1 million yen in his savings account.

838
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,412
He had a lot of difficulty
while he was on extended leave.

839
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:18,183
But now, he's been cast on Amazon's
program, on Mr. Hamada's show, so...

840
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:22,221
Well done, Yamamoto!
I'm very happy for you!

841
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,389
I'm so happy for you!

842
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,692
But remember,
it's too early for regular TV.

843
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,294
-Seriously?
-Is he for real?

844
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,729
Now he has to provide his own car?

845
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,797
It's here!

846
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:32,764
Wow!

847
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,166
That's really mine.

848
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,534
That's it.

849
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,402
Mr. Yamamoto, thank you very much.

850
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:39,571
Thank you.

851
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,607
Wait a minute.

852
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:42,708
It's coming.

853
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,244
Seriously, this is... I haven't...

854
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,745
KEIICHI YAMAMOTO'S BELOVED CAR
THE WOLKSWAGEN BEETLE

855
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,847
-When did you buy it?
-In November.

856
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,316
-How much was it?
-I bought it last November...

857
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,119
Its net price was
a little over 2.8 million yen,

858
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,388
but all in all cost over 3 million yen.

859
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,924
I've only paid the monthly
installments of 70,000 yen

860
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,327
for November, December, January, February,
March, April, May...

861
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,696
I've only paid seven months,

862
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,732
so I still owe 2.5 or 2.6 million yen.

863
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,166
-Wow.
-That must be hard for you.

864
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,735
-Thank you very much!
-Well.

865
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,503
You said if it was ten years ago,

866
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,872
you would've brought your own car
in a flash.

867
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,674
You said we weren't tough enough!

868
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,276
The times are different now!

869
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,511
A lot of things change in ten years!

870
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,479
You're not wrong.

871
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:23,615
I need to work hard
so I can appear on regular TV again!

872
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,550
Please, Sata.

873
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,385
I'm sorry. Thank you for your sacrifice!

874
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,654
I'm sorry for making fun of you earlier.
I'll apologize, so please!

875
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,454
No, no, no.

876
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,125
Mr. Hamada, please.
I'll do anything but this.

877
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,695
I'll bow down to you with Sata,
so please don't do this.

878
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,630
Sata, just go!

879
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,632
Did you know this was going to happen?

880
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,334
-Just go and take the car.
-You knew!

881
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,402
I'll do my best for Hamada's army!

882
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,337
You knew this was going to happen!

883
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,873
Sata, you must have known, too!

884
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,409
Did you know about this, Mr. Hamada?

885
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,243
Of course not!

886
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,713
I've got my electronic toll card
in the car!

887
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:55,781
Can you give the card back to me?

888
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,482
Burn the car down, card and all!

889
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,918
Can you take the card out?

890
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,654
You sound so desperate.

891
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,689
Volkswagen Beetle
New car price approx. 3 million yen

892
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:08,560
Yamamoto purchased this brand-new
Volkswagen Beetle last fall.

893
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,898
Although its weight is rather light
at 1300 kg,

894
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:15,067
it is equipped with an IC turbo engine.

895
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,072
It is very much
like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

896
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,074
Engine 1.2L I4 SOHC IC
Turbo / 105 hp / FF / AT / Weight 1300kg

897
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,775
I'm raring to go.

898
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,043
Then let's go, Itakura!

899
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,746
-Crush him!
-Yeah, crush them!

900
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,315
Mr. Yamamoto, don't worry.
He won't catch me.

901
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,950
Without a scratch!

902
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,652
He just has to lead all the way.

903
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,587
You don't look like a man
who is going to lead all the way!

904
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,090
I'll lead all the way.
I won't let him touch me.

905
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,926
He's the last one I want driving my car!

906
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,894
The one driving my car
is the craziest of them all!

907
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:44,997
Mr. Yamamoto, let's enjoy this more!

908
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:50,235
I finally understand how you feel, Nagisa.

909
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,807
After telling us off so much,
you're afraid to lose your own car?

910
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,676
Don't make that sad face!

911
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,647
Enjoy the game.

912
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:06,818
Mr. Yamamoto's been really good to me,
but this is a competition.

913
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,286
RIDING THE REAPER'S EXPRESS
TOSHIYUKI ITAKURA

914
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,123
I can't control what happens
on the battlefield.

915
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:16,194
I wonder what Itakura's killer instinct
is like.

916
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,298
What will become of Yamamoto's Beetle,

917
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,468
forced to take the place
of the precious Laurel?

918
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,874
Now, Sata gets strapped into the Beetle.

919
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,109
It still has that new car smell.

920
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,746
Are you close to Yamamoto?

921
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,182
Yes, Mr. Yamamoto's been
really good to me.

922
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:41,119
Is that right? That means nothing. Okay?

923
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,387
Mr. Sata?

924
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,557
-Mr. Sata?
-Yes.

925
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:48,894
I'd appreciate it
if you could treat my car well

926
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,264
I think that would be good
for both of us.

927
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,232
It's a very easy car to drive.

928
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:55,734
I understand.

929
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,736
Please don't stomp too hard.

930
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,337
Of course. I'm aware of that.

931
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,174
No problem, I will treat it very well.

932
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:06,478
The TV business has changed a lot
in ten years.

933
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,915
You're not supposed to do anything
too dangerous nowadays.

934
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,484
Is that right? I didn't know that.

935
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,052
That's true, right?

936
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,122
But this is for Amazon, not regular TV.

937
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:20,659
You don't have to show that kind of action
to Amazon members.

938
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,131
Amazon members only want to see nice,
tame programs.

939
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:27,632
Please, Sata.

940
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,902
He can't hear me anymore!

941
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,004
I'm glad he couldn't hear you this time.

942
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,206
He couldn't hear me...

943
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,876
Toshiyuki Itakura (Mercedes-Benz S320)
vs Masaki Sata (Volkswagen Beetle)

944
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,212
The Volkswagen Beetle
only weighs 1300 kg,

945
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,981
compared to Itakura's Mercedes
at 1800 kg.

946
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,450
If Itakura allows the lighter Beetle
to get away,

947
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,486
he may not be able to catch him again.

948
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:51,990
Three...

949
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:53,625
Two... One...

950
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:54,860
Don't let him get away!

951
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:56,561
Go!

952
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,296
The race starts now.

953
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,898
It's a very smooth start
by Yamamoto's Beetle.

954
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,434
Driving the Beetle is Sata
from Hamada's army.

955
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,137
It seems neither has been bothered
by the explosion.

956
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,072
Itakura seems to be a bit off pace.

957
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,574
He's getting away!

958
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,476
Just lead from start to finish!

959
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,780
The race has just begun.
No one knows what awaits them.

960
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,548
Run, run!

961
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,519
We can hardly see anything.
Sata is driving slowly, so is Itakura.

962
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,221
Looks like Itakura is catching up to him.

963
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,790
Slowly, slowly.

964
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,891
Keep going!

965
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,695
We still can't see the Mercedes.
There it is!

966
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,633
We go from this angled bank area
to the slippery zone.

967
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,635
No, he can't stop. He can't stop!

968
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,671
Is he okay? The car is on its roof!

969
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,907
We go from this angled bank area
on to the slippery zone.

970
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,609
No, he can't stop. He can't stop!

971
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,379
Is he okay? The car is on its roof!

972
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,414
We go from this angled bank area
on to the slippery zone.

973
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,283
No, he can't stop. He can't stop!

974
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,719
Is he okay? The car is on its roof!

975
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,354
Is Sata okay?

976
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,723
Itakura also comes up from behind.
He brakes.

977
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,425
That's so dangerous!

978
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,661
Is he okay?

979
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:05,630
There's some kind of gas spraying
from the car.

980
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:10,869
Wow, a massive accident has happened
on this "Road to Hell."

981
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,105
The Beetle has completely overturned.

982
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:15,941
Are you okay?

983
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,108
Is Sata okay?

984
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,210
Watch out!

985
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,945
Is he stupid?

986
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,513
It overturned!

987
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,048
But...

988
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,049
It's overturned.

989
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,717
It overturned.

990
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,152
What did he do?

991
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:28,887
That's terrible.

992
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,056
What the hell is he doing?

993
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,326
Sata!

994
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,329
Sata!

995
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:41,032
What? It's making some whooshing noise!

996
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:43,969
Hey!

997
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,573
It's totally crushed!

998
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,208
Get out of the way!

999
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:51,810
We'll turn over the car.

1000
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,212
They're turning over the car.

1001
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,514
That's so scary.

1002
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,283
The oil is leaking.

1003
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:01,720
Won't it explode?

1004
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,488
Stand back!

1005
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,424
There's oil leaking from the car.

1006
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:07,525
It's dangerous!

1007
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:08,693
It's dangerous.

1008
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,395
We should stand back.

1009
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:12,163
Sata's still in the car.

1010
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,931
SENTOSHA

1011
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:16,601
Let's have a look.
It happened just after here.

1012
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:20,772
The slippery area is coming up next.
He couldn't stop and went straight ahead

1013
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:24,876
into the dirt wall.

1014
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,213
After impact, the car overturns
completely onto its roof.

1015
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,650
Wow, I wonder if Sata is okay.

1016
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,652
Is Sata...

1017
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,455
We're worried about how Sata is doing.

1018
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,591
Now, this is the on-board camera.

1019
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,028
This is the video of the moment of impact.

1020
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:53,038
We are worried about both
the Beetle and Sata.

1021
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:54,105
SENTOSHA

1022
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:55,707
Can you hear from Sata?

1023
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:57,475
Sata!

1024
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:03,181
Sata!

1025
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:04,783
Get out, get out!

1026
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,052
-Get out!
-There's an oil leak.

1027
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:07,919
Be careful!

1028
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,020
You better get out!

1029
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,989
Get out, get out quickly!

1030
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,191
Get out, get out.

1031
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:15,493
Come on.

1032
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,195
Just keep going!

1033
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:20,298
Run!

1034
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,708
I need my ETC tollway card...

1035
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,409
It doesn't matter!

1036
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:34,713
Yamamoto!

1037
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,281
It's on this side!

1038
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:38,550
It's dangerous, you need to get away!

1039
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,684
ETC.

1040
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,687
It's dangerous, though...

1041
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:43,922
Just get it afterwards.

1042
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,323
Forget about the ETC card!

1043
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,325
It's dangerous!

1044
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,394
I'll ask them to reissue it.

1045
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,096
Get away, get away.

1046
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:56,234
SENTOSHA

1047
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,370
Here's the view of Sata's face.

1048
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,038
We can have a look what happened
at the time of impact.

1049
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:01,106
This is it!

1050
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:04,442
The air bag pops out. That's so dangerous!

1051
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:07,345
He's okay. He's alive.

1052
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:08,947
He has somehow survived.

1053
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,682
He has somehow survived hell.

1054
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:13,284
SENTOSHA

1055
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:17,389
Sata has now retired.

1056
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:19,057
The Beetle is most likely
out of action as well.

1057
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,659
Itakura from Junior's army
cruises to victory.

1058
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,194
WINNER - Toshiyuki Itakura (Junior's army)
Earns 10p from Sata's retirement

1059
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,397
-What were you doing?
-What happened?

1060
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:26,831
The steering wheel wouldn't turn.

1061
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,334
-What?
-I couldn't turn.

1062
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:30,535
That's not possible!

1063
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:32,704
That's never happened before...

1064
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,172
I couldn't change direction.

1065
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:37,475
You were worried about your ETC card
more than me!

1066
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,277
I wanted to get it out of the car.

1067
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,447
Did you get the ETC card out of the car?

1068
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,181
No.

1069
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,651
The car could have exploded.

1070
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:47,685
Are you okay?

1071
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,254
Yes, I'm not injured.

1072
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:52,690
This is Sentosha!

1073
00:44:55,994 --> 00:45:00,665
Sata has left the battlefield
for a medical assessment.

1074
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,069
Hamada's army - 14 points
Junior's army - 20 points

1075
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,504
Three more battles to go
in this second round.

1076
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,574
Junior's army has now taken the lead.

1077
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:14,112
Ozawa's got a grenade in his hand again.

1078
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,147
He takes the lead right from the outset.
That's dangerous!

1079
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,882
Wow, Ozawa!

1080
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,184
He's taking aim!

1081
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,753
Wow, he's riding up the side of that car!

1082
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,693
