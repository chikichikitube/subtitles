00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,719
The double soup that Amano says is that At first, make two different kinds of soup separately and then combine them into one.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,659
In addition, Amano was preparing a "Nagoya Cochin", a high quality chicken, not just dried fish.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:17,140
If you do not care properly .. Its Blood will make the soup dirty subtly..

11
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,239
Finally, he burned the gas.

16
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:52,459
Amano who said Ramen is the universe used over 100 kinds of dried fish.

00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,000
Wow.. Really??

18
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,120
Six hours after, the chicken soup was ready.

26
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,240

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,319
Wow.. There are so many Dried fishes over there.

28
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:04,740
Amano started to taste all dried fish in the store.

29
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,439
And...

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,620
This flying fish ['Ago'] will be okay ..

31
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,719

37
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:42,400
Amano, who had this hidden card 'Flying Fish' in his hand, immediately returned to the kitchen.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,960
This double soup that combines flying fish and chicken .. How is it taste?

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,420

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,900

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
He is really Pro.

43
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,839

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Because he can do Japanese / Western / Chinese /Japanese food' ..

52
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,500
Why are you saying "Japanese food" twice?

53
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,299
Because He is great.

54
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,199
He opened the oven.

00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,779

The soup is finally put into the bowl.

69
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,320
This is the chicken broth that he made for about 6 hours. (Miyasako: It's just sticky)

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,199
This is the 'Flying Fish' broth.

71
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,959

Besides, He put black sesame on it.

77
