"The Quest"

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,120
Welcome to The Quest.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,280
Today's show is Lotti Nakaoka's
Calendar Project

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,600
and Hot Spring Club's
Calendar Project.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,600
It's two Calendar Projects!

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,600
Wasshoi!

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,600
"Morisanchu"

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,640
Hello...

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,560
Hello!

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Hello, everyone!

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,960
"Soichi Nakaoka (Lotti)"

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,360
First, it's Nakaoka's
Calendar Project.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,520
This time, it's a hot topic in
the Tokyo Olympic Games, surfing.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,040
- What?
- Yes.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,560
- You guys surf a bit too...
- Me and Asako.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,880
- Mr Degawa also...
- I've tried wake surfing.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,040
When you guys tried,
it looked like you failed...

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
No...

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,240
Hey...

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,040
Mr Uchimura,
how long did you stay there?

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,400
- What?
- "What"?

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,880
It felt like I stayed on the board
for 30 seconds.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
It was shorter.

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,080
The water depth was 30cm?

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,240
No, it was 10cm.

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,760
It's 10 centimetres...

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,120
It was about 50cm!

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,280
It's 10 centimetres!

29
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,680
I didn't have time!

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,640
You practised?

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,280
Since July, when I went to film
at the previous location.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,520
- That's petty.
- It's petty!

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,600
It isn't petty!

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
- That's petty!
- I only got two hours!

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,040
This is so petty!

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,240
This is totally petty.

37
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
It's not petty.

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Please don't call
the effort I made petty.

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Petty!

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,880
You must've filmed
something amazing, then.

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,960
I went too far, sorry.

42
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,800
Let's have a look, then!

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Please don't do this!

44
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,840
"Lotti Nakaoka's Calendar, August"

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,560
This is impressive!

46
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
"He'll try surfing techniques"

47
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,240
"Oshima, Oniyakko, Okazu, Ganbare

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,040
on a cosplay tour in Mie, Gifu"

49
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,520
Members of The Quest
go to various places every month

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,120
to take beautiful photos.

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,440
We'll make a collection and aim
to complete the 2022 calendar.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
The Quest Calendar Project.

53
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,160
Nakaoka goes surfing.

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,080
- He started practising in July.
- Petty. You started in July!

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,640
When he was filming QTube
in Hyogo...

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
Someone will help me!

57
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,560
For three hours every morning
before filming,

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,000
he trained intensively
at a wave pool in Kobe.

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,400
Surfing practise 1,000 times.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
1,000?

61
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,680
People say practise 1,000 times,
but they don't actually do 1,000.

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,880
He had already practised 235 times
in four days.

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,560
This time, he practises repeatedly
at a wave pool,

64
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,360
and will learn techniques
of the highest difficulty.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
You've outdone Chen!

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
We'll take a photo like this.

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,880
The star of surfing, tube riding.

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,920
Aren't you aiming too high?

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,320
Tube riding.

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,040
It's a bold technique done
in the tunnel of a breaking wave.

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,960
This is cool!

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,560
The stage is the newest wave pool,
Shizunami Surf Stadium.

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Petty!

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,760
The pool is 160 metres long
in total.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,960
For levels from beginners
to professionals,

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
it can create as many as 80 kinds
of waves.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,960
There's also a surf shop
and a cafe.

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
Nakaoka will be practising here

79
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,120
and aim to take the best photo.

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,160
- Mr Uchimura can do it.
- The coach wants you.

81
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,120
Okay.

82
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,560
Music, start.

83
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
What?

84
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,040
"Hero"?

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,120
His coach is Amuro, whom everyone
talked about in the Olympic Games.

86
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,680
This is our special coach this time!

87
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,440
Wow! Impressive!

88
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,320
Impressive!

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
- Oh?
- What?

90
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,240
- What?
- It's Surfer, Amuro!

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,400
"Our cameraman messed up"

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,400
It's out of focus.

93
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,120
This is our cameraman Omori,
who has been one for 10 years.

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,520
- It's Omori!
- I have to film...

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640
Miss Amuro clearly,

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
but it is out of focus.

97
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,000
"Out of focus in his 10th year"

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Only film the part
when I leave the pool?

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,120
If possible, please surf again.

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

101
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,840
Once more,
this time, the special coach is...

102
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,760
Wow, impressive!

103
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,640
It's the surfer, Amuro!

104
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,000
She'll go to America
three days later for a world tour,

105
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,440
but she agreed readily to be
his coach if it's just one day.

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,480
So cool!

107
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,240
I want to take this photo.

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
I think it'll be rather difficult.

109
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,160
- Obviously.
- Yes.

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Waves rarely form "tubes" in the sea
in the first place,

111
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,640
and it's said that it takes 10 years
to learn this technique.

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
But we're at a wave pool this time.

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,640
It can create a wave that forms
a tube anytime freely,

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,640
so it depends on
how much effort Nakaoka makes.

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
First, he'll practise
with simple waves.

116
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,680
No!

117
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
But there's a small problem.

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,600
My feet can't touch the bottom.

119
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
-You have to paddle.
- This is bad.

120
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,840
The water is six metres deep
where the wave is,

121
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,360
and his feet can't reach the bottom.

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Also...

123
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Paddle!

124
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
It was the one just now.

125
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,120
It's much higher than Kobe's waves!

126
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
It uses air pressure sent from
the pool's bottom to create waves,

127
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,800
so big waves come suddenly.

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
It's scary.

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
Paddle! Paddle!

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,760
The result of his practise
beforehand doesn't help at all.

131
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,800
I see.

132
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
But it's impressive.

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,520
He runs out of strength at once.

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm exhausted!

135
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
It was only four times.

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,920
He can't even return
to his starting place.

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
It comes again!

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,040
Like seaweed floating between waves.

139
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Stop the waves!

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,600
As a result...

141
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
I have surfboard sickness.

142
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,400
Are you okay?

143
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Yes, I'm totally okay.

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,080
Please go surfing if you like.

145
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,920
- Okay.
- She's here for you!

146
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,040
Let's ride the waves with Amuro
and learn how to surf, then.

147
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,160
A surfer rides the wave sideways
and does tricks when surfing.

148
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,800
At competitions like the Olympics,

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,080
surfers are scored
on a scale of one to 10

150
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,400
according to the trick combination
and difficulty.

151
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
Everyone, this is Nakaoka!

152
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,040
I think you often see surfers
riding white waves,

153
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,560
but they're broken waves
that beginners ride on.

154
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,440
Skilled surfers ride on the face
of a wave, which is at an angle.

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,520
Manoeuvres are possible
only after you can ride on these.

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,360
This is very difficult!

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,280
Impressive!

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,520
He starts practising again
30 minutes later.

159
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,360
It was Amuro's kindness
that became his support.

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,520
Almost!

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,440
She never denies his effort
and helps him improve by praises.

162
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,160
This is fun.

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
Nakaoka has gotten back
into the swing of it.

164
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh, you did it... Wow!

165
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,840
You made it!

166
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
That one was perfect.

167
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,440
- It was perfect?
- Yes, perfect.

168
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,200
I think it was a pass among today's.

169
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,320
What's the most important point?

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,320
It's paddling.

171
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,520
It's the most important in surfing.

172
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
It's paddle.

173
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,560
How is the paddling of a pro
different?

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,240
It's a paddling race between
Nakaoka and Amuro.

175
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,280
Nakaoka starts midway as a handicap.

176
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,160
I have to win like this.

177
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
No, I think I will win.

178
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Start!

179
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,320
They start together.

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,840
Her entry is beautiful.

181
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
That's a bronze medallist for you,

182
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
the thrust of one row is strong.

183
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Wow!

184
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,680
On the other hand,
Nakaoka doesn't go forward at all.

185
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,160
And then...

186
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
Wow, this is impressive!

187
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,720
Hey! Darn it!

188
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,560
Nakaoka is defeated miserably.

189
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,080
It's totally different!

190
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
She isn't short of breath at all.

191
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Also, we'll inspect a pro surfer's
sense of balance.

192
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,920
They'll try surfing with hammock,
which Nakaoka had done before.

193
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,760
Can they stand
on a rocking surfboard?

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,960
Do your best.

195
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,040
Okay...

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,600
Be still...

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,160
Be still... I'll stand.

198
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
No!

199
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,800
What? Was it so difficult?

200
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,880
It's harder than taking
a tube surfing photo.

201
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,400
I think I won't fall.

202
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,800
- I think it's okay.
- I see, that's your goal?

203
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,480
Medallist Amuro tries it now.

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
You can do it.

205
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Okay.

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay...

207
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Her body is...

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
The medallist fails instantly.

209
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh no... You're funnier than me!

210
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Oh no!

211
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,720
It's so hard!

212
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,080
I want to try again.

213
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
You want to try again?

214
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,080
That's the vitality that endeavours
on a global scale.

215
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,320
Oh no...

216
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,400
I change gear when I enter the sea,

217
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,040
and I'm determined to win a medal.

218
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
It's the fourth time she challenges
herself to this stupid trick.

219
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,400
Good... You can do it. Good...

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
You're standing...
Oh! You're standing! Impressive!

221
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,280
She finally does it successfully.

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,200
Wow!

223
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,760
The set makes it much more difficult
than last time.

224
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,160
The ropes are very long, we placed
the hammock low for safety.

225
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,720
I see...

226
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
What are you thinking, usually?

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Day six of practise.

228
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,080
From now on, a legend in the surfing
circle will be his coach.

229
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,480
Champion of the year
of three Japan National Tours,

230
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,200
the legend had been a coach
of Japanese surfers

231
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
in the Tokyo Olympic Games.

232
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,120
This is Mr Masatoshi Ohno.

233
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,920
I heard you're too much of a legend

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,040
to be the coach of a beginner.

235
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,720
No, but I'll be very strict.

236
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,720
Whoa!

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,640
His goal today
is to ride a wave sideways.

238
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
He keeps practising.

239
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,680
Don't look down too often,

240
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,040
look at the direction you're going
when you stand on the board.

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,280
He corrects his line of sight,

242
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,280
and then...

243
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,080
- Amazing...
- Good job...

244
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
Good...

245
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,280
Good!

246
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,280
It felt so good
to ride the wave smoothly.

247
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,440
That's right.

248
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,040
Now Nakaoka's motivation
goes higher.

249
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,760
I'm getting close to success...

250
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,800
- Mr Nakaoka.
- You startled me!

251
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
You startled me.

252
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,080
- Practise?
- No, I'm here to teach you.

253
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,320
- Really?
- Yes.

254
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
Amuro is here again!

255
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,000
She keeps thinking about
Nakaoka's progress,

256
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,200
so she hurried here in private.

257
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,960
The legend pushes Nakaoka,

258
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,080
and the medallist checks it.

259
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
- Wow! Wow!
- This is amazing.

260
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,160
You should stand first,
then go sideways.

261
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
I see.

262
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,600
No, when he takes off at first,

263
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,560
- he needs to go at an angle.
- Oh...

264
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,520
But that's...

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,280
Our Japanese surfers are arguing.

266
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
Don't have a fight because of me!

267
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,560
Then, after he practised 406 times,

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Nakaoka finally goes sideways.

269
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
Wow!

270
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
Amazing!

271
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,320
Ouch!

272
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,600
That one just now was good.

273
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,120
But it hurts!

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Will he try a tubed wave next?

275
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,720
- Let's try it once.
- Let's do it once.

276
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
He finally tries to ride
a tubed wave.

277
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,200
It's the most difficult wave
at this facility.

278
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
A tubed wave is totally different
from the other waves.

279
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,840
The waves he's ridden so far
break along an angle,

280
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,400
so they're easy to ride.

281
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,680
A tubed wave rises gradually
when it breaks.

282
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,320
I see.

283
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,000
- Please watch this.
- Okay.

284
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
What is the wave like?

285
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,320
They planned to watch one, but...

286
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,520
You can't just look now, go.

287
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,960
- Go? Go?
- Yes.

288
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,960
The coach says go, so you'll go.

289
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,680
It started suddenly,

290
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,520
and he's engulfed by the wave.

291
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,440
I was washed together
with the board!

292
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,640
I was spun together with this.

293
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
This is really impressive!

294
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,640
It's so funny!

295
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,320
- You're still scared, right?
- He's scared.

296
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,840
His body is scared.

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
I'll be honest with you.
My brain is scared too.

298
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,680
As Amuro is here, we'll show her
how cool Nakaoka is.

299
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
A man who uses a drill to drink.

300
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,600
"A man who uses a drill to drink"

301
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,560
What's this?

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
He sucks it up?

303
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,320
Actually, it uses the spin
of the fastener.

304
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,400
Will Nakaoka be able
to drink up one litre of milk?

305
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,240
- Miss Tsuzuki is here.
- Oh.

306
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,800
Amuro is a huge fan of QTube.

307
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
Can Nakaoka show her
how cool he is?

308
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,160
Three.

309
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Two.

310
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
One.

311
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Oh, it's locked.

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Gosh, this is...

313
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,920
Is it this way? Which way?

314
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
This is a gamble.

315
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,640
He unlocks it and tries again.

316
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,160
"Nakaoka drinks milk with a drill"

317
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
It's the other way.

318
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,800
He reverses the spin
and tries again.

319
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
"The 3rd time"

320
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,720
Wait, it's slow.

321
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,160
Isn't it slow?
It isn't at the highest speed?

322
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,960
It's awfully inadequate!

323
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,200
Correct all the faults.

324
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,680
- Three, two, one.
- Can Nakaoka do it?

325
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,360
"We are very sorry"

326
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,760
Almost!

327
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,720
It was going well, but the last sip
went into my windpipe.

328
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,400
- You'll try?
- Yes.

329
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm scared, though.

330
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,640
No, don't try it!

331
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,240
We can't let you do it!

332
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,400
Amuro, please use your guts
for surfing.

333
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,160
Day seven of practise.

334
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,840
The pool is closed on this day,

335
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
so Nakaoka is trained indoors.

336
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,280
Take-off is the key.

337
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,600
Nakaoka's weakness
is that he is slow to stand up.

338
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,640
If you compare
the two kinds of waves,

339
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,200
on the left, when he stands up,

340
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,680
although he is still above the wave,

341
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,960
a tubed wave is fast,

342
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,800
so he has already gone down.

343
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,840
It's here. Go!

344
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,320
He practises this
200 times in a row

345
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,280
to let his body memorise it
thoroughly.

346
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,240
He looks determined the 200th time.

347
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,680
The wave doesn't come.

348
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
Day eight.

349
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,240
He wants results for his practise,

350
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,160
but he's struggling again today.

351
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
"615th wave"

352
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
"654th wave"

353
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,320
Darn it!

354
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,200
Maybe it's impossible to ride
a wave of this level.

355
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,400
It's not bad, though.

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,760
But a light shines on Nakaoka.

357
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,760
Wow! He did it!

358
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,840
He did it!

359
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,280
He managed to ride it on his knees.

360
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,800
It's Nakaoka's style,
but I went pretty far!

361
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,880
Kneeling is an original style,

362
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,160
but he creates new patterns
one after next.

363
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,920
Upright kneeling-style.

364
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,560
Also,

365
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,760
a style like offering prayers
to something.

366
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,080
It looks cool!

367
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,000
Wow!

368
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,560
Savanna Yagi's style.

369
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
Brazilians, do you hear me?

370
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,920
He trains himself hard
till the night.

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,960
Wow...

372
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,920
Kneeling has become stable.

373
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,680
If he enters a tubed wave kneeling,

374
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,200
it'll be the first time in history
and it's interesting.

375
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,320
There's potential.

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,160
The number of waves
Nakaoka has ridden is 833.

377
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,400
A part of me thinks
I should save some energy,

378
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,000
but when I start,
I just keep surfing.

379
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,360
I just paddle and ride a wave.

380
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,000
When I thought I must consider
tomorrow,

381
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,400
another wave comes.

382
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,320
The last day has come.

383
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,000
It's sunny and the pool looks blue,

384
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,560
the condition is amazing.

385
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,800
Good, the weather is good.

386
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,680
Nakaoka shows how well he surfs,
right at the start.

387
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,120
The last day has come.

388
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,120
Nakaoka shows how well he surfs,
right at the start.

389
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
Wow! Amazing!

390
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,560
- Impressive!
- Good.

391
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,520
He does a long ride to shallow water
right at the start.

392
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,880
That one just now was good.

393
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,240
- Wow!
- He was in the wave.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
He does one more after that.

395
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,480
"835th wave"

396
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,920
Wow!

397
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,360
He's good!

398
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,160
It's a super-long ride,
longer than the one just now.

399
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,760
Wow, he didn't flip over!

400
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,600
That was amazing!

401
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
This photo is so cool!

402
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,600
It's really good!

403
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,720
They took a very good photo,

404
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,280
but he isn't in a tube.

405
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,680
We plan to go deeper in the tube.

406
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,160
Cameraman Kumano
is fussy about it.

407
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,480
It took a long time after this.

408
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,640
His standard is whether the wave
is above Nakaoka's head or not.

409
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,040
No tube.

410
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
I know, but...

411
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,240
He wants to go inside the tube,
even for a second.

412
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,040
Nakaoka rides 1,000 waves
by sheer determination.

413
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,200
You can do it!

414
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,760
Argh!

415
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
It has been five hours
since he started.

416
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
It's approaching the time limit,

417
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,760
so this is the last wave.

418
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
He's in. He's in it, right?

419
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,920
Was he inside?

420
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,680
He was in it for a second, right?

421
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,360
I did it, didn't I?

422
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,840
It was right before he fell.

423
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,040
This.

424
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,400
Now that he mentions it, he seemed
to be in the wave for a second.

425
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,760
What is Kumano's judgement?

426
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
Well, you didn't look good.

427
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
He doesn't look good.

428
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,480
He's in the wave, though.

429
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Whether it's beautiful or cool,

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,920
it's just a matter of looks.

431
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,560
It's okay if I'm cool as a person.

432
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,000
Someone who cares about safety
is more cool.

433
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,160
Among the photos taken this time,

434
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,440
which one is chosen
to show in the calendar?

435
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Let's ask Amuro, who is in America,
to have a look.

436
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,160
This one.

437
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Oh, it's cool!

438
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I'd like to show you
the manly look on my face.

439
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Can you see this?

440
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,320
This is how I look.

441
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh? A pro of the line of sight.

442
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,720
Your line of sight is a pro's.

443
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,960
So this photo will be included
in the calendar.

444
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
Amuro, do your best
in the world tour!

445
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,360
Impressive!

446
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's say he's in the wave
like that.

447
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,960
The photo itself is cool too.

448
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,480
She came to visit you in private.

449
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,160
She came on day one,

450
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,360
went back after that,

451
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,400
then she spent about two hours

452
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,640
to come to see me
because she was worried.

453
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Maybe she has a crush on Nakaoka?

454
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,440
Impossible.

455
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,160
At once! Why not?
Let us fool around for a bit!

456
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,040
Okay, next, it's this.

457
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,600
Hot Spring Club's Calendar Project.

458
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,840
Yay!

459
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,760
What tour is this?

460
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
This time, it's a cosplay tour.

461
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,000
Eh?

462
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,440
What? What? What?

463
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,960
A cosplay tour.

464
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,280
What is it?

465
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,440
You don't have to do cosplay.

466
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,120
We did it.

467
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,400
3.5 hours away from Tokyo,

468
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,000
Hot Spring Club goes on a tour.

469
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,280
The Quest Calendar Project
in Mie and Gifu.

470
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,440
First, they came to Mie Prefecture's

471
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,040
Iga Ueno Castle.

472
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
We've come to...

473
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,240
Mie!

474
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,520
The tour starts
with these four people.

475
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,440
They'll try wearing various
cosplay-like outfits

476
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
and take a photo of a good moment
for the calendar.

477
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Mr Nagata is interested in it,
isn't he?

478
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,120
He only wants to see our cosplay.

479
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
He's smirking...

480
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,040
when watching, and rewinds,

481
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,760
watches again and rewinds.

482
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,880
Ew!

483
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,400
- "Ew!"
- It's me who wants to throw up.

484
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,000
You're blushing so hard!

485
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,840
Your glasses are cloudy.

486
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Their cosplay tour starts now.

487
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
Their cosplay tour starts now.

488
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
They've come to the Akame 48 Falls.

489
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,440
It's said that the Iga Ninja
used to train themselves here.

490
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,360
First, they'll try to take
a ninja-like photo.

491
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,240
Okarina, you wanted to be a ninja?

492
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,640
Yes, I dreamt to become a ninja,

493
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,480
I look up to people
who walk silently.

494
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,240
Do you get it? Like he's there
before you realise.

495
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,800
Mr Yotaro and Mr Masuda will teach
them how to do the ninja training.

496
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,160
Okarina said it.
You walk soundlessly.

497
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
Is that possible?

498
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,160
It's stealthy steps, right?

499
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,920
You lift your foot up,

500
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,920
then put it down.

501
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
Lift it up, put it down.

502
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,320
Then you can walk soundlessly.

503
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,040
Really? You made a bit of sound.

504
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
- No...
- She's awful!

505
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,920
- No...
- Because it's gravelled.

506
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,160
Lift up your foot,

507
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,840
put it down.

508
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,680
- It's okay, right?
- It is.

509
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,880
- Like this.
- Mr Masuda, you're competitive.

510
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,720
Now, the training starts.

511
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,880
She's fast.

512
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,560
At the Ninja Training Village,

513
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,360
you can experience Iga School's
Akame Ninja Art.

514
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
First, it's climbing.

515
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,320
Ninja can cross a high wall
without difficulty.

516
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,480
It's high.

517
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,080
It must hurt!

518
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,240
Ow...

519
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Be careful!

520
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
Wow...

521
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,200
Be careful... She fell.

522
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,160
Then, in the Ninja House,

523
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,880
there are various gimmicks hidden
for escaping from the enemy.

524
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,480
What's that?

525
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,720
She went up there, didn't she?

526
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,480
Blue Ninja!

527
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,880
This is the Mizugumo technique,

528
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,040
which lets the ninja cross a river
without getting wet.

529
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,320
Go.

530
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
Blue Ninja!

531
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Impressive.

532
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,960
Blue, well done.

533
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,600
Next, they'll defeat an enemy
in the dark when they can't see,

534
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
with a technique called Zasaguri.

535
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,440
They'll probe with a sword sheath
to locate the enemy.

536
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,280
He's searching.

537
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
The moment he finds it...

538
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,600
he kills it with one strike.

539
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,520
Impressive!

540
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
We prepared this for you.

541
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,120
What's this?

542
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,640
- This is...
- Oh no.

543
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
Wow!

544
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,960
- I get excited holding this.
- Yeah.

545
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,840
Okarina, will you have a match
with Mahiru again?

546
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,320
We'll see that again?

547
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,800
Last time, in the swordplay match...

548
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,400
Don't grab!

549
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
You shouldn't grab!

550
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm going to grab you
the whole time when you do it!

551
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,200
Try that! I'll hit you even so!

552
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,600
They fought fiercely
and ignored the game.

553
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
She keeps getting hit!

554
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,600
What will happen this time
in the Zasaguri competition?

555
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,400
They're blindfolded and start after
they turn in a circle three times.

556
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,000
Wow, how can they go forward
so quickly?

557
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,640
She took it! She took it!
She took it!

558
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
What fight is this?

559
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,280
Be careful.

560
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
- It's fierce!
- Stop it.

561
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,120
She's strangling Mahiru!

562
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,000
Stop! Stop!

563
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,040
Wait... what are you doing?

564
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,440
It's the wrong sport.

565
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,320
They fought silently.

566
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,080
- You couldn't make any sound?
- Why didn't you make any sound?

567
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,560
It's like the fight
I'd seen on the street.

568
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,960
"Female Ninja Fighting
on the street"

569
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,440
- No way!
- This isn't a calendar!

570
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,320
Don't say "October," idiot!

571
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,280
Next, they'll learn about
Seki Blades in Gifu.

572
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,360
- Excuse me.
- I'm curious about many things.

573
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,720
The Yoshida father and son here
are swordsmiths.

574
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,280
We're swordsmiths of Seki.

575
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,480
I've heard about Seki Blades.

576
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,240
Seki City, Gifu Prefecture is known
as the City of Blades.

577
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,760
The traditional
sword forging technique

578
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,720
has been passed down
since the Kamakura period,

579
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
it is still inherited nowadays.

580
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,440
They'll see a real Japanese sword.

581
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,720
You pull it out like this.

582
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,080
- Wow!
- Impressive!

583
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,160
It's the first time
I see a real one!

584
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,200
It was owned by a warrior
400 to 450 years ago.

585
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,520
She tries to hold it.

586
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,320
It's a bit scary.

587
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,560
Is it okay to look like this?

588
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Wow!

589
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,560
It's so cool!

590
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,600
They're both blades,

591
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,200
but a Japanese sword is forged in
a way different from a common knife.

592
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,240
Impressive.

593
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,880
They now try to forge a sword.

594
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
Cosplay?

595
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,680
Usually, only qualified people
can wear the costume,

596
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,720
but it's special today.

597
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,960
I feel sombre.

598
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,160
Yes...

599
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Seki's sword making is passed down
as a religious ritual,

600
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,000
they even start the fire to use
from iron.

601
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,880
Wow!

602
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,080
- Impressive!
- You started a fire in a second?

603
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,640
Wow!

604
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,680
Impressive.

605
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,160
In that one second?

606
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,320
This time, they'll learn how
to forge a Japanese sword,

607
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
and make a knife.

608
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,320
The raw material is good quality
steel made from iron sand

609
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,640
called Tamahagane.

610
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,840
It is heated and rolled thinly,

611
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,880
then it's put on a lever and forged.

612
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,600
Air is sent from bellows
and it's heated.

613
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,040
The piece of steel becomes red
at once.

614
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,920
Impressive!

615
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,560
Now, it's the forging process.

616
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,640
Okay.

617
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,320
First, it is hit to make a cut.

618
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,720
It is folded...

619
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Wow.

620
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,640
To make a double layer.

621
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,120
It's double-layered?

622
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,000
This process is called
"fold forging."

623
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,800
Wow!

624
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,920
The process of hitting it strongly
and folding is repeated,

625
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,800
impurities are hammered out
and it makes the carbon uniform.

626
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,200
Impressive!

627
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,120
The sparks...

628
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,760
The extra components are hit out
as sparks,

629
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,400
and the steel becomes strong.

630
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,400
I see.

631
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
Hit it right after it's taken out,

632
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,800
steel cools very quickly.

633
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,480
They first practise
by hitting a wooden stick.

634
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,440
Oops.

635
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Well... The first time
was the most...

636
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Oh, I missed the first one. Sorry.

637
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,440
Is it hot if sparks fly to my face?

638
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,120
- It is.
- Oh, I see.

639
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,560
Now, they do it for real.

640
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,040
- Do your best.
- Do your best.

641
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,960
Okay!

642
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,720
Oops. Hang on.

643
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,400
- "Hang on..."
- Hey...

644
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,600
I'm sorry.

645
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
I got scared.

646
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,840
They change gears and start again.

647
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,920
- Okay!
- Alright!

648
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,040
Put it down.

649
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,680
- They fly.
- It's a lot of sparks.

650
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,600
Wow.

651
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,840
Okay!

652
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,440
What... which one?

653
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,960
Hit it or not?

654
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,480
I have no idea!

655
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,080
Wait a minute!

656
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,200
- What did that "okay" mean?
- I don't know.

657
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,280
That "okay" meant it's done.

658
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,800
It was really bent.

659
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,200
They'll use the power of a machine
to shape the forged steel

660
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,440
into the shape of a knife.

661
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,480
Impressive.

662
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,840
Next, apply a special clay called
Yakibatsuchi on the blade.

663
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,880
Wow, it's a knife already!

664
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,520
This is an important step
to blow life into the blade.

665
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,360
Apply a thin layer on the part
that should be hard,

666
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,000
and a thick layer
on the other parts.

667
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,160
The blade with clay applied
is heated to 800 degrees,

668
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,960
then it's put into water
to cool rapidly.

669
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,720
The process is called quenching.

670
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,960
It's amazing.

671
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,520
The steel's hardness is changed
by doing so.

672
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,920
The part with a thin layer of clay
cools quicker, so it becomes hard,

673
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
and the part with a thick clay layer
cools down slowly,

674
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,880
making it flexible.

675
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,960
The difference is what gives
the Japanese sword its pattern,

676
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,160
Hamon.

677
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,520
It's a beauty that comes from
the expert's technique

678
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,640
that pursues
sharpness and toughness.

679
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,960
And this is the finished knife.

680
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
The pattern is there.

681
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,400
- The Hamon is there clearly.
- Wow!

682
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,040
- Nice.
- It's very sharp.

683
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,080
It's sharp.

684
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,880
She does it in this costume...

685
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,240
Delicious.

686
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,160
We blew life into this,

687
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,920
shouldn't we name it?

688
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
Should we call it Nukumasa?

689
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,880
The kanji "On" of "hot spring"

690
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and Mr Masaya's "Masa."
So, "Nukumasa."

691
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,560
- Amazing!
- Thank you.

692
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,760
It's elegant.

693
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,200
"Named by Okarina: Nukumasa"

694
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,280
One of the choices for the calendar

695
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,320
is the photo shown,
which captured a beautiful moment.

696
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,240
It's cool!

697
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,480
Next, it's a new sport
that originated in Mie Prefecture.

698
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,480
- A table-tennis table.
- Yeah.

699
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,160
- Hello...
- Hello.

700
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,120
Its designer Mr Murai
is expecting them.

701
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,040
Designer?

702
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
- Is this table-tennis?
- It is, right?

703
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,800
Usually, the ball goes above the net
in table-tennis,

704
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,520
but this goes beneath it.

705
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,920
- What?
- What's that?

706
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,200
- This is the ball.
- It makes a sound.

707
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,360
It makes a sound.

708
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
It doesn't bounce.

709
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,720
This is Lifelong Sport,
SS Ping Pong.

710
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,920
It is based on the parasport
Sound Table Tennis,

711
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,320
so even people who are
sight-impaired can enjoy

712
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,920
this universal sport.

713
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,120
You get a point if the ball touches
the opponent's end frame,

714
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,320
but you lose a point if it goes out.

715
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Even without special skills,

716
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,960
the rally continues to some extent.

717
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
This is bad, I can do this forever.

718
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
This is fun!

719
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,160
- You'll have a match.
- A match?

720
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,520
The winning team will get
Matsuzaka Beef.

721
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,680
What?

722
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,160
You can have Sukiyaki Hot Pot.

723
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,680
Wow...

724
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,720
Will you do it?

725
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,960
- Of course!
- Let's do it.

726
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,480
It's seniors against young people,

727
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,320
Team Showa versus Team Heisei.

728
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,000
- I'll start.
- Okay.

729
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,840
Team Showa is at a disadvantage
when it comes to stamina.

730
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
A chance.

731
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,440
"Team Showa vs Team Heisei: 0-0"

732
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,840
Yes!

733
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,040
"Showa vs Heisei: 0-1"

734
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,000
Heisei's point.

735
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
It's "Kite" again.

736
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,000
- I said don't use "Kite!"
- I was thinking about the beef.

737
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
It's "Kite" again!

738
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,560
They try to keep up for the beef.

739
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,560
"Showa vs Heisei: 0-2"

740
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,840
Yes!

741
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,080
"Showa vs Heisei: 1-2"

742
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
Matsuzaka Beef!

743
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,440
But Team Heisei is younger,

744
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,320
their movement is sharper.

745
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,680
They got the match point
and led by a huge margin.

746
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,000
- It's the match point.
- So quick.

747
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,360
It'll be a sweeping victory.

748
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,680
Even so, Team Showa
doesn't give up till the end.

749
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,760
"Team Showa vs Team Heisei: 2-10"

750
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,440
Good.

751
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,560
Do your best!

752
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Good, it's interesting.

753
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,360
It's a long rally.

754
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
This rally is long enough.

755
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,720
Yes!

756
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,400
Yes!

757
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,400
"Showa vs Heisei: 3-10"

758
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,040
Just score the point.

759
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,800
A good match.

760
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,800
This is good.

761
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,320
Yes!

762
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,880
Game set.

763
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,600
Team Heisei gets a Sukiyaki Hot Pot.

764
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,480
But they don't know
how to do a food review.

765
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,000
They relied on Ms Murakami
the other day.

766
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,120
The look on Okarina's face
is super evil.

767
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,480
They've come to Wadakin, a famous
restaurant established in 1878.

768
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,520
They'll have Sukiyaki course meal,
Matsu, which costs 18,200 yen.

769
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,560
A waitress called Yakite
serves the beef in its best state.

770
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,880
Sugar, tamari soy sauce,
and a little kombu stock are used

771
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,720
to bring out the flavour
of the beef itself.

772
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,640
This is the ultimate Sukiyaki.

773
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,880
Looks delicious!

774
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
This is awesome!

775
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,160
They try it now.

776
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,520
Please review.

777
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,480
Just one bite...

778
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,120
What a waste!
Does she know how much it costs?

779
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,040
She eats like it's in a dream.

780
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Delicious! It can't be more tender!

781
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,840
This is thick,

782
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,040
but it melts the moment
I put it in my mouth.

783
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
The fibres are fine,

784
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,640
the juice flows, flows,
flows along the fibres

785
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,160
and my mouth is full
of the juice of meat.

786
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,800
"A unique food review"

787
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
No... this is wrong!

788
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,680
Don't use it here!

789
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,560
Next, they'll stand-up paddleboard
and cruise along a river.

790
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,240
This is Miya River
in Mie Prefecture.

791
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,920
The clear river is known to be
Ise Jingu's river for purification.

792
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,720
There is a stunning view
at its upper stream.

793
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,760
It's so clear!

794
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,120
It's very clear!

795
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,440
- What's this?
- It's so transparent!

796
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,160
- It's transparent!
- Wow!

797
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,880
In fact, in the national
water quality surveys,

798
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,680
Miya River had been
in the first place 11 times.

799
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,600
It feels like I'm floating in space!

800
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,960
It is so transparent,

801
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,400
that it gives you the illusion
that you're at a high place.

802
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,240
As you're here, why don't you have
a boxing match again?

803
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,200
Why?

804
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,640
We are so serene now.

805
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,120
Let's do SUP boxing.

806
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,040
Will it be settled this time?

807
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,160
Mahiru versus Okarina.

808
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,520
Okarina,

809
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,960
now we can only have a conversation
with our fists.

810
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,160
Be careful...

811
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,400
It hasn't started!

812
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,280
Stop it! That's nasty.

813
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
Hey!

814
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,160
Stop it!

815
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,440
Okarina hates it.

816
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,680
Don't be ridiculous, jerk!

817
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,840
The match starts!

818
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,440
They fall.

819
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
So early.

820
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,320
My leg is still on it!

821
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,480
Wow!

822
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,760
Fall! You'll also fall!

823
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,440
You jerk!

824
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,240
Stop it.

825
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,680
The match is over.

826
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,280
Next, they've come to a mountain
in Gifu Prefecture.

827
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,480
Oh?

828
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,040
Hello.

829
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,360
Yui P and Oniyakko join them here.

830
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,240
Actually, this place is Sekigahara.

831
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,240
Wow...

832
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,920
The Battle of Sekigahara.

833
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,760
Who would come to power
after Hideyoshi died?

834
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,240
The Eastern Army led by
Tokugawa Ieyasu

835
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,480
and the Western Army
led by Ishida Mitsunari

836
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,240
fought a decisive battle.

837
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,840
The place they're currently at is
Ishida Mitsunari's headquarters,

838
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,080
Mount Sasao.

839
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,440
This is the place where a total
of 160,000 soldiers in both forces

840
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,120
occupied and fought.

841
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,280
They faced the opposite mountain

842
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,920
and fought below.

843
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,840
- What?
- On two mountains?

844
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
It's romantic.

845
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,240
You had no idea, right?

846
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,800
- You don't know, do you?
- You don't know that.

847
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,480
So I want you to fight
the Battle of Sekigahara.

848
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,360
What do you mean?

849
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,240
That's why you called them here?

850
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,400
I thought that was why
we were asked to come.

851
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,720
Isn't it too few?

852
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,560
Ask more people to come!

853
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,560
This is Sekigahara
Mount Sasao Exchange Centre.

854
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,080
The Armour Experience that
lets you transform into a warrior

855
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,400
is a popular attraction.

856
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,680
This time, they'll borrow
the costumes here

857
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,520
and take a photo
of the best moment in a swordfight.

858
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,040
Their teachers are...

859
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,040
We are Old Battlefield Hospitality
Warrior Team, Sekigahara Unit.

860
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,560
Let's go!

861
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,680
It's the members of Sekigahara Unit,
who advertise Sekigahara.

862
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,080
First, they learn the basics,
how to draw a sword from its sheath.

863
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,120
Then, put the sword back in
the sheath without looking.

864
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Put it back.

865
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,360
It looks easy at a glance,

866
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,600
but putting it back is difficult.

867
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,880
You're cutting yourself.

868
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,120
The trick is to trace the back
of the sword with a finger.

869
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,520
- Wow!
- It goes in if you trace it.

870
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,280
Next, it's the way to wield a sword.

871
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,840
Wield the sword like
writing the kanji of "rice,"

872
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,960
and slay while taking a step.
This is the basics.

873
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,920
I see.

874
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
She's fired up.

875
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,280
- It's strong.
- Good.

876
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,440
Why do you stab?

877
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,680
Then, the main topic, a swordfight.

878
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,120
There was no sound at all
just now, right?

879
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,600
Actually, the swords
don't hit each other.

880
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,600
Stop right in front.

881
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,480
This is made of wood.

882
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,880
In fact, many swords used in
swordfights are made of wood.

883
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,280
They break if they really
hit each other,

884
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,640
so they need the acting skill
to stop right before that.

885
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
It's difficult.

886
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
From now on, they practise
sword fighting on their own.

887
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,360
We aim to take a photo
for the calendar

888
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,240
during the real battle scene.

889
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,560
Original period drama,

890
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,760
"Oshima Taiheiki."

891
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,480
In the civil war period,

892
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,680
the Oshima Army joined
the decisive battle,

893
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,640
but in front of the enemy's
overwhelming fighting power,

894
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,360
their situation is desperate.

895
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
General,

896
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
our army is almost wiped out.

897
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,120
10,000 soldiers in the enemy's force
are right there.

898
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,160
What?

899
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,960
Is that true?

900
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,320
What should we do?

901
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,520
Hey, be quiet!

902
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,520
But General Oshima, at this rate,
the enemy is going to come here!

903
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,960
General Oshima,
please at least escape alone!

904
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,000
Be quiet!

905
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,280
I shall not escape!

906
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,760
My friends and comrades
are in this camp.

907
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,000
Oshima!

908
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Who is there?

909
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,440
General Oshima, it's already over.

910
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,480
Everyone, thank you
for following me for so long.

911
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,880
Thank you...

912
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,080
- Who wrote the script?
- Let's go!

913
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,760
The battle starts!

914
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,320
Oshima!

915
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,480
It seems your game is up.

916
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,880
- Darn you, P.
- She looks strong.

917
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,040
Your body is like
a Boy's Festival doll.

918
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,440
Isn't it funny?

919
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,440
Sakon, give me that.

920
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Do you know what this is?

921
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,440
She took out a prank bomb
that the Oshima Army didn't know.

922
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,880
We aim to take a more realistic
photo by using this.

923
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,360
Should I throw it?
Should I throw this?

924
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,320
Stop it!

925
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,200
What?

926
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,360
What are you doing?

927
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,840
This is how I fight!

928
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,320
It's so heavy
that I couldn't run far.

929
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,760
It's scary!

930
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,520
My heart... It's scary!

931
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,520
Everyone, attack!

932
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,640
The battle finally starts.

933
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,920
They'll perform the swordfight
they practised

934
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,880
and take a photo for the calendar.

935
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,120
The General is there!

936
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,160
I can't tell who is who.

937
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,160
- What is that?
- It's awful.

938
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,960
Yoshiko's movement is good.

939
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,000
The warrior waited for her.

940
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,200
- What is it?
- Not like that.

941
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,560
This isn't what I expected.

942
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,120
It's different.

943
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,200
Oh, this isn't right.

944
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,280
Good.

945
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,720
She's defeated.

946
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,680
I must not fall!

947
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,280
It's wrong.

948
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,840
Because...

949
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,600
This...

950
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,120
costume is...

951
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,000
expensive!

952
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
So she can't fall?

953
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,640
Everyone, we'll escape!

954
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,560
Fall back!

955
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,400
Let's end this with an explosion!

956
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,520
Impressive!

957
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,880
Wow!

958
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,920
This is great.

959
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,360
Isn't this stupid?

960
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,040
This is impressive!

961
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,680
Okarina runs away
like a common foot soldier.

962
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
The look on each of their faces
is quite good.

963
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,560
We took a realistic photo.

964
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,960
So this photo is chosen
for October's calendar.

965
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,920
That's all for the Cosplay Tour.

966
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,840
Somehow it wasn't what I expected.

967
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,000
What?

968
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,000
And the script after
you started acting.

969
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,520
It was awful.

970
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,240
They must not do this behind
any epic drama.

971
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,800
The last part when they ran,
and "boom!"

972
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,760
Don't put "October" there, idiot!

973
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,080
What is so "October" about this?

974
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,240
That's not October!

975
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,640
What was that "October"?

976
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,480
People will think highly of it
sometime later,

977
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,240
it's criticised now, though.

978
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,480
Van Gogh couldn't sell his work
when he was alive.

979
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,560
It was after a very long time.

980
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,320
You mean after we die?

981
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,320
After a very long time,
people will go, "This October!'"
