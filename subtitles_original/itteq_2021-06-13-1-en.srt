00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,680
"This show was broadcasted
on the 13th of June, 2021"

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,200
Welcome to The Quest.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,240
Today, Ganbareruya will embark
on the Calendar Project,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,560
and we'll have
the 16th Miyagawa Expedition.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,560
Wasshoi!

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,720
Hello, hello, hello.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Hello!

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,800
Hello!

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,040
"Yoshiko, Mahiru, Ganbareruya"

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,240
"Ganbareruya goes on a Calendar Tour
full of stunning sceneries"

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,800
We'll go there?

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,000
This place is so scary.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,720
The Goto Islands!

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,200
I've caught it!

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,040
Yellowtail amberjacks
at the Goto Islands!

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,960
Members of The Quest go to various
places in the world every month

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,280
to take beautiful photos.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,440
They aim to collect the photos
and complete the 2022 calendar.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,440
This is
"The Quest" Calendar Project.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,080
We'll go to Kochi Prefecture
and Ehime Prefecture this time

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,680
to take photos
of stunning sceneries.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,080
We have come to Kochi Prefecture!

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,880
Now, it's time for Yoshiko Quiz.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Kochi Prefecture here is the place
where a famous actress is from.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,240
Who is the actress?

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,680
Dad, please answer that!

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
- Dad.
- Ms Ryoko Hirosue.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,240
Isn't it?

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,400
Who is it?

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,120
The correct answer
is Ms Ryoko Hirosue!

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,560
- Who's that?
- What is she doing?

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,840
Wait a minute.

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,480
My joke was so lame,
I feel awful now.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
The first stunning scenery
they visit is...

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,480
The feature of early summer,
fireflies.

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,080
The Shimanto River basin and various
places in Kochi Prefecture

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,920
are well-known
for the fireflies there.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,680
They will try to take a photo
of them surrounded by fireflies.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,880
We have the assistance

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,960
of Mr Rei Ohara,
an animal photographer.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,160
I used to be
a gossip magazine's photographer.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,800
- Gossip magazine.
- Yes.

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,920
I washed my hands of that.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,240
Now, I take photos of baby seals,

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,720
long-tailed bushtits,

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,920
and fireflies.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
That's why I'm good
at taking photos in dark places.

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
I scoped out celebrities

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,080
and took photos in many dark places.

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,840
That's because one must not use
lighting to photograph fireflies.

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,240
Fireflies communicate by the light
emitted from each other.

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,480
So if there is
artificial light nearby,

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,480
it disturbs their light-making,

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,840
and leads to extinction
in the worst-case scenario.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
The photoshoot will be done
in a special way.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,800
The time period
when many fireflies come out

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
will be too dark for
the two of you to be seen.

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,720
I'll take a photo of you after
sunset when there's a little light,

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
keep the camera fixed there,

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,160
and take photos of the fireflies at
the same place and add them there.

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
It'll be done by multiple exposure.

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm looking forward to it.

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,240
The stage of the photoshoot

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,040
is Sukumo City, Kochi Prefecture's
Kurokawa Hotaru no Sato.

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,520
Firefly is an endangered species,

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
but here, because of the effort
made by the residents,

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,600
the number increases every year.

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,600
Wonderful!

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
Oh, I found one!

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,200
Over there!

71
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,240
It's there!

72
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,720
- Yes, that's a male firefly.
- Look.

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,480
As you can see, during the day,

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,360
fireflies rest on the back of leaves
and the shadow of the grass

75
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,360
to preserve energy for the night.

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,080
What firefly is this?

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Genji-botaru.

78
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Why is it called that?

79
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,200
Genji-botaru and Heike-botaru
are aquatic fireflies,

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Heike-botaru mainly fly low
above farms,

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,800
they aren't very fast.

82
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,840
Genji-botaru fly high
above the sky.

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,640
Hence, "Genji" connotes momentum,

84
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,040
and "Heike" connotes inertia.

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,520
I see.

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,400
They start emitting light
30 minutes after sunset in general.

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
But there is some time until sunset,

88
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,520
so we'll introduce activities in
the neighbouring Ehime Prefecture.

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,680
It is this one.

90
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,840
Will it be in time?

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,840
What's this?

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,560
- A natural water slide.
- You can slide?

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,960
It's a great waterfall chosen as one
of the 100 waterfalls in Japan,

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,560
Yukiwa Waterfall.

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,080
We aren't going to slide down there,
are we?

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,440
You'll get injured if you start
at the top,

97
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,320
so you'll start near
two-thirds of the height.

98
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,800
Is it really two-thirds usually?

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,040
It's always two-thirds.

100
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
You aren't too fired up, are you?

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,720
- You figured it out?
- Hey!

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,200
Mahiru goes first.

103
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,960
- Don't let go yet.
- It's okay, not yet.

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
- Don't let go yet!
- Okay, okay.

105
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
Are you okay? I'm scared!

106
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,760
- Three, two, one.
- So fast.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,320
It's too long!

108
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,880
She slides 40 metres straight down.

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
Machan, are you okay?

110
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,080
It got bumpy halfway.

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
Yoshiko goes next.

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
Okay, let's go!

113
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,640
Three, two, one.

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
- I know how you feel.
- It has just started.

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,200
Oh, no.

116
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,760
Watch out.

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
It's dangerous.

118
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,880
She fell inside.

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Yocchan.

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
It was scary.

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Then, a problem occurred.

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
Yocchan, look at your GoPro.

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,520
Hey!

124
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,840
There's no way it filmed anything!

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Yocchan, do it once more!

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
Why?

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,720
We must report about your GoPro
to the director.

128
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
There's no need.

129
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,760
- Ms Maekawa--
- Don't tell her!

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,640
It's fine,
only the editor needs to know.

131
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,320
- Ms Maekawa!
- Don't tell her!

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
There's no need to tell her!

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,520
I told you not to tell her!

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,920
They check Yoshiko's camera.

135
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,040
Let's go!

136
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,080
The standby at the beginning
is already not good enough.

137
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,320
Most of it wasn't filmed.

138
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,320
Not most of it!
The first part was filmed!

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
On the other hand, Mahiru's...

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,480
How was it?

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,640
Wow, it's stable.

142
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
Amazing.

143
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,640
Impressive.

144
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Amazing.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,360
That's journalism.

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,400
At the same time, the photoshoot
of fireflies has started.

147
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Here it is.

148
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,160
First, a photo of the ladies
is taken before the sun sets.

149
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
Then, when the area starts
getting dark...

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,800
- It's emitting light.
- So pretty.

151
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,400
So pretty.

152
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
So pretty.

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,960
- Is it saying it's time to go?
- Yes.

154
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,320
There are two special chemicals
in a firefly's lower abdomen,

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,720
and the firefly makes the chemicals
react to make it glow.

156
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,640
In dark places, the fireflies
gradually fly to high places,

157
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,520
like they're flying
towards the stars.

158
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,360
The origin of the firefly's
Japanese term means "star drops."

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,720
They fly like the stars
are dripping down,

160
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,200
so they're called "hotaru."

161
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,920
We have filmed fireflies many times
in The Quest so far,

162
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,280
but it was very difficult to convey
how beautiful they are in the video.

163
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
That was you.

164
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,400
But with the use of the latest
high-sensitivity camera,

165
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,680
as you can see, people and fireflies
can be shown vividly.

166
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,920
Impressive.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,720
We couldn't have filmed this scene
20 years ago.

168
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,600
It would've been difficult
even two or three years ago.

169
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,560
The lifespan of an adult firefly
is only about 10 days.

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,400
Until its life ends,

171
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,920
it emits light and flies around
to look for a mate.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,600
- It doesn't leave you at all.
- Not at all.

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,880
You got yourself a huge female.

174
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
When the sun sets completely,

175
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
he opens the shutter
and takes photos of the fireflies.

176
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,120
This is the finished photo.

177
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
Amazing!

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,560
You look like fairies
in the world of fireflies.

179
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,240
I actually wanted you
to look more like monsters.

180
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,600
Darn you!

181
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,600
She said it.

182
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,280
It's never made anyone this happy.

183
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm happy.

184
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
Next, they'll try the art that
gained a lot of attention lately.

185
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,360
Modern artist, Ms Chad,
will show us how to do it.

186
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,240
This is her performance.

187
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,360
Impressive.

188
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
She's strong.

189
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,000
She uses a giant brush and writes
the words that come to her mind.

190
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,920
This art performance is a fusion
of calligraphy and dance.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
I see.

192
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,120
The performance is unearthly,

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
and Yoshiko empathises with it.

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,520
- She's crying.
- Yoshiko loves it.

195
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,960
Amazing.

196
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,200
"Now...

197
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,920
make your voice be heard."
is what I wrote.

198
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,160
Can they also
make their voices be heard?

199
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,680
Mahiru goes first.

200
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,680
The material doesn't tear, right?

201
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,640
The material is tough.

202
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
It's Kochi's Washi paper.

203
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,000
- She slapped herself.
- The slapped boy.

204
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
I think they're cut out
for performances like this.

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
They are.

206
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Is that a teardrop?

207
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
The teacher nodded deeply just now.

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,920
- She wrote on her face first.
- Yes.

209
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,560
Oh, in the middle.

210
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,760
This suits them.

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,560
She matched the lyrics.

212
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,360
- "Me."
- "Me."

213
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,160
And now, the words
finally came to her mind.

214
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,320
What words came to Machan's mind?

215
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
She's snickering.

216
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,240
- What's that?
- Just write it.

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,680
What does this piece of work
look like in the end?

218
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,440
Amazing, Machan.

219
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,800
I knew you wrote the character
of "Me" in green.

220
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,920
I don't recognise any character
you wrote after that.

221
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,080
"Full tank."

222
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,680
"Empty."

223
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
"All love."

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
You created an extraordinary artist!

225
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Everyone has been moved.

226
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,680
I didn't do it to move people.

227
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,760
Is that so?

228
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
Next, it's Yoshiko's turn.

229
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,120
The song is Koji Tamaki's "Den-En."

230
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,720
- "Den-En."
- Good.

231
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,680
She's cut out for it.

232
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,720
- Good.
- Good.

233
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,120
The weather is good.

234
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
The weather is good.

235
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Good.

236
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,520
Good.

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,320
She's just dancing.

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,280
She doesn't write at all.

239
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,680
She doesn't.

240
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,240
She's not writing yet.

241
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,200
No word has come to mind yet.

242
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
- Good.
- "You."

243
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
Good.

244
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,360
She doesn't write.

245
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,800
She's not writing yet.

246
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
The words haven't come to mind.

247
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,960
Because it's quiet.

248
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,200
She got it?

249
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
- With her foot.
- Good.

250
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,400
The words don't come
to Yoshiko's mind.

251
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,920
Not yet?

252
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
But now...

253
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,520
She got it.

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,320
She suddenly started, wow!

255
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,680
The way the words come to mind
is awesome.

256
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
There are many words.

257
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,240
She's writing a lot.

258
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,080
Wow, the words came to her mind.

259
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,920
She doesn't stop.

260
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,480
She turns it over.

261
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,560
She's gasping for air.

262
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
Is that all?

263
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,680
It feels so good!

264
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,560
Can I ask what you wrote?

265
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,560
"Do you think,
only you can't do it?"

266
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
"It's..."

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,240
Did she really write that?

268
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
"not because you can't do it,

269
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,360
it's only because your motivation
isn't strong enough."

270
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,760
Here.

271
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
"Who decided mountains are green?"

272
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,120
"Who decided the sky is blue?"

273
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,280
Wow, she got so many ideas?

274
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
"You work too hard,
Japanese people!"

275
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
"You work too hard,
Japanese people!"

276
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Yocchan works too hard.

277
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,080
She improvised it just now.

278
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,480
Next, they'll go to see another
stunning scenery seen only at night.

279
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,160
A total lunar eclipse.

280
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,080
When the Earth, the moon and the sun
are in one straight line,

281
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,320
the moon goes completely
into the Earth's shadow,

282
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,000
and it looks reddish brown.

283
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
They went filming on the 26th May,

284
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,760
and it was the best chance

285
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,680
to see the first total lunar eclipse
in Japan in three years.

286
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,360
I know that.

287
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,680
It's the Super Flower Blood Moon.

288
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
You mean supermoon, right?

289
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
What?

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,120
You don't know?

291
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,760
First, a full moon in May
is called Flower Moon.

292
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,400
- Is that so?
- And today, the 26th May,

293
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,800
the full moon
will look very close,

294
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,840
and it's called supermoon.

295
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
Also, a total lunar eclipse
is called Blood Moon,

296
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,720
so this is
a Super Flower Blood Moon.

297
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,520
You asked us to come here
without knowing that?

298
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,840
This time, they'll use the Super
Flower Blood Moon as a background,

299
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
and jump on a bicycle.

300
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,600
They'll try to take a photo
like this.

301
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
E. T.?

302
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,440
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

303
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,520
The stage of the photoshoot

304
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,280
is the Shikoku Karst across Kochi
Prefecture and Ehime Prefecture.

305
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,480
This will be your jump ramp.

306
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,520
What?

307
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,760
The moon will rise from the shadow
of the mountain there.

308
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
The camera is on the opposite side.

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,240
Can it see us now?

310
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
I think so.

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,000
To make the moon look big
in the photo,

312
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,440
it must be one kilometre away
from the object.

313
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,040
So we'll use a telephoto lens
at a place

314
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,320
where the moon
and the object overlap.

315
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,920
We must be able to jump
to begin with.

316
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Kochi BMX Association's Mr Kubouchi
will teach them how to jump.

317
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,800
Use the momentum
to raise the front tyre.

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,960
Right, we have to
raise it ourselves.

319
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Can Mahiru do it?

320
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,120
Amazing.

321
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,720
Impressive!

322
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Amazing!

323
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,840
I can do it already.

324
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
So quick!

325
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,520
Next, it's Yoshiko's turn.

326
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
- You can do it.
- Be careful.

327
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,720
Good. Parallel...

328
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,760
This is scary.

329
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I'm scared.

330
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,040
It's scary.

331
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,520
She changes gear and tries again.

332
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Oh, I'm scared!

333
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,200
Oh, I'm scared. I'm so scared.

334
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,360
Without the skill to raise
the front tyre...

335
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,240
You can do it... not.

336
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
Oh, I'm scared!

337
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm scared.

338
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
How do you do so many patterns?

339
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm impressed, Yocchan.

340
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,840
- But a big problem occurs.
- What?

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,360
- Wow, it's big.
- It's big.

342
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
The rain hits from the side.

343
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,400
Unfortunately, it is raining
in Shikoku on this day.

344
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,880
Obviously, they can't even try
if the sky isn't clear.

345
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Indeed.

346
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,640
At the same time,
the sky is clear in Ishigaki Island.

347
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,880
Amazing.

348
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,640
The total lunar eclipse has started.

349
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,960
The moon entered the Earth's shadow,

350
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,440
faint sunlight shines on it,

351
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
turning it into
a mysterious reddish brown.

352
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,800
Amazing.

353
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,440
It's gorgeous.

354
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,400
I wish I could jump
in front of this.

355
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,800
But we want

356
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,360
to at least take a photo like this
of the moon and Ganbareruya,

357
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
so they tried again the next day,
but...

358
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,400
Bad weather.

359
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,840
It's impossible today too.

360
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,720
What's this?

361
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,320
The fog is extremely thick.

362
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,280
Completely white.

363
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,960
There's no way something a kilometre
away can be seen by a camera.

364
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,720
In fact, we don't get many chances
to take a photo like this.

365
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Why don't we make an appearance
from there naked?

366
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,720
What the heck?

367
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,680
It's okay if this area
is covered in fog.

368
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,080
Out of desperation,
Ganbareruya makes the fog art,

369
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,800
"Adam and Eve."

370
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,040
Wait, I can see a bit.

371
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
We don't need this.

372
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
It's very obvious.

373
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
Beautiful.

374
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,720
The photo is amazing.

375
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,360
This is amazing.

376
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
We can use it for the calendar!

377
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Next, the stunning scenery
Shikoku is proud of.

378
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,560
You'll climb a mountain
and go towards the stunning scenery.

379
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,560
Their outfits
are for mountain climbing.

380
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,640
They've come to the highest peak
in West Japan,

381
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,160
Mount Ishizuchi.

382
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,360
Can we climb it?

383
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,560
Oh, you put bread inside!

384
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,600
- Why can't I?
- It's the bread given to us,

385
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,880
and she keeps it to herself.

386
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,200
Why can't I? I was hungry.

387
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,880
You definitely need to say it.

388
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
Their mountain guide
is Mr Matsumoto.

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,760
Mount Ishizuchi

390
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,640
is the deity worshipped
at the Ishizuchi Shrine.

391
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,360
It's also a place for training,

392
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,680
you'll reach a state
of selflessness.

393
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
Put the bread here before you go.

394
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,920
I'll bring the bread.

395
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,360
Basically, primary school children
to old people

396
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,840
can enjoy climbing Mount Ishizuchi.

397
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,600
But Yoshiko's weight
is 80 kilograms,

398
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,760
the path is too difficult.

399
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,720
- She gained weight again?
- Machan!

400
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,720
The woodland peonies are blossoming.

401
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,520
Yocchan.

402
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
Everyone is waiting, Yocchan.

403
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
Sorry.

404
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,920
I won't blame you if you're late
because you're tired,

405
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,080
but don't be late
because you keep talking.

406
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,680
She's strict.

407
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,920
When they're about to reach
the limit of their stamina,

408
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,000
a dangerous route that stops
beginners appears.

409
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,680
We'll now climb up here.

410
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
What?

411
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,520
We'll go there?

412
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,080
Give me a break.

413
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
The climbing chains
were made in the past

414
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,960
for monks who aims to reach
a state of selflessness.

415
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
The cliff is almost vertical,

416
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,880
they'll only use the chain
to climb up.

417
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,720
The chain is 65 metres long,

418
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,120
they can't turn back
once they start climbing.

419
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,240
Wow, I'm scared.

420
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,880
A problem occurred after
they climbed 10 metres.

421
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,640
Maybe Yocchan's condition is bad.

422
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,360
Yoshiko has almost used up
her energy before coming here,

423
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,000
she's reached her limit.

424
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,080
Yocchan!

425
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,160
Your limbs are too tired,
aren't they?

426
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
Don't force yourself!

427
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,680
That's what Machan says.

428
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I'll do it.

429
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,240
Yoshiko squeezes out the last bit
of her strength

430
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,400
and climbs up the chain again.

431
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,240
Yocchan, you can do it!

432
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,720
Then, finally...

433
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,480
She worked hard.

434
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,240
All right!

435
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,080
I made it!

436
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,120
You did very well, Yocchan.

437
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,600
Let's hurry to a flat ground.

438
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,320
- This place is scary.
- It is.

439
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,000
Five hours after they started
climbing the mountain...

440
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,600
We're here.

441
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,560
We're here.

442
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,960
Amazing!

443
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,120
They arrive at the peak
of Mount Ishizuchi,

444
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,160
which has an altitude
of 1,974 metres.

445
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,520
- It's fantastic.
- Impressive.

446
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,560
Japan is beautiful.

447
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
It's gorgeous.

448
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,160
But this isn't the stunning scenery
of their destination.

449
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,040
You see a shrine in front of you,
don't you?

450
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

451
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,680
That's the highest peak
in West Japan.

452
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,280
That's your destination.

453
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,400
What?

454
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,320
Their destination is the main peak
of Mount Ishizuchi, Tengu-dake.

455
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,920
It's dangerous, Mr Ishii.

456
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
My bottom tightens when I see you.

457
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,000
Mr Ishii, please come closer here.

458
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,200
- Please, I'm scared.
- I'm scared.

459
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,280
They'll go to the knife ridge
where both sides are cut off.

460
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,160
This place is so scary.

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
They can only rely on their bodies.

462
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,280
Former climber, cameraman Ishii,
walks swiftly there.

463
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
It's dangerous, Mr Ishii.

464
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,320
Mr Ishii, no...
Mr Ishii, please stay still.

465
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,120
The further they go,
the more dangerous the path gets.

466
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,720
Oh, no, I'm falling.

467
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,640
Stop.

468
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,960
- You can do it.
- Stand up straight.

469
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,520
- Yocchan, don't go too far there.
- What?

470
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,720
- Don't go too far, you'll fall.
- I'm okay.

471
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm scared, Yocchan.

472
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,080
Stop, I'll be scared
if you say that.

473
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,000
Sorry.

474
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,520
Hurry up, come here, Yocchan.

475
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Stop it, Machan is making this
twice as scary!

476
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,840
I can't look.

477
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,120
Don't look.

478
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,640
Mr Ishii. Mr Ishii, stop, really.

479
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm scared, Mr Ishii.

480
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,840
They climbed for one hour,
and finally...

481
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,440
We made it.

482
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,480
- Is this the peak?
- The peak.

483
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,720
They arrive at Tengu-dake,

484
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,600
the highest peak in West Japan
and Mount Ishizuchi's main peak.

485
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,560
It's here.

486
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,160
Thank you.

487
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,880
We're finally here.

488
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,160
The view is stunning.

489
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,440
This scenery is gorgeous.

490
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,200
It's the first time I see
a view so stunning.

491
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Right?

492
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,840
I can see the whole of Shikoku.

493
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,200
Indeed.

494
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,880
This is the scenery the Tengu saw.

495
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,200
They take a commemorative photo
at the peak.

496
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,120
Nice back.

497
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,920
Tengu-dake, 1,982 metres,

498
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,520
we climbed here successfully!

499
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,160
Mr Ishii!

500
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,280
- Stop it!
- Stop moving like that!

501
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,880
For June in the calendar...

502
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,000
we'll use this photo.

503
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,080
That's all for
Ganbareruya's Calendar Project.

504
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,400
They shone the most
in the calligraphy session.

505
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,600
I think I'd be good at the combined
calligraphy and dancing too.

506
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,560
Dad, you look like you do.

507
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
Chen and Kurosawa
will be good at it.

508
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,800
I am moved.

509
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
We'd think too much
and it wouldn't be funny.

510
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,960
- That's possible.
- Yeah.

511
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Next, it is this part.

512
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,160
The 16th Miyagawa Expedition!

513
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,400
This time, it's the Fishing Series.

514
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
What? Fishing?

515
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm not confident.

516
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,760
The other day, we changed from
catching tuna to yellowtail at once.

517
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
His target is...

518
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,440
What? "Catch a huge bigfin reef
squid longer than a man's height!"

519
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,360
Bigfin reef squid is usually
about 40 centimetres long,

520
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but in spring, when they lay eggs,

521
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,760
at Nagasaki's Goto Islands,

522
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,800
monsters that are longer
than a person's height appear.

523
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,360
The mission this time is to make
squid rice with the giant squid.

524
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,080
I couldn't catch tuna,

525
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
so I want to try again.

526
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,360
I want to show our viewers a giant
bigfin reef squid longer than a man.

527
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,520
How about this, Mum?

528
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
After filming the tuna fishing
last time,

529
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,400
Assistant Producer Hirata, known
as Mum, got hooked on fishing.

530
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,160
I can't forget the feeling
of catching cod,

531
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,560
I thought my arms
weren't strong enough,

532
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,120
so I have personal training
once a week.

533
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,000
- What?
- Good.

534
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,680
Sorry, but the direction
you work hard is wrong.

535
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
A new member joins their team.

536
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,920
- Assistant Director Yui?
- Yes.

537
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,600
Wait, you're an assistant director?

538
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,640
- Your top is Dior?
- Yes.

539
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
What?

540
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,800
What? Your shoes are Vuitton?

541
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,680
Why?

542
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,440
My grandpa is the president
of a certain company.

543
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,360
We'll bleep it. Which company?

544
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,280
"Secret"

545
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
"A huge enterprise"

546
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,640
Seriously? The bleep just overlapped
with my "what?"

547
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,560
The celebrity works as an assistant
director for work experience.

548
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,840
Will your grandpa not get angry
when he sees this?

549
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,520
If he gets angry,
we'll be finished in an instant.

550
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,040
We'll go to the Goto Islands!

551
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
We'll do our best!

552
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,160
Will he be able to catch
a monster-level bigfin reef squid?

553
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,920
Miyagawa Expedition.

554
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,280
Catch a giant bigfin reef squid.

555
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,240
The stage is a World Heritage,
the Goto Islands,

556
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,040
where history coexists with nature.

557
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,760
Miyagawa Expedition.

558
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,840
It's obvious when you see it,
it's impressive!

559
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,360
The 16th tour!

560
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,560
In the Goto Islands!

561
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,480
I've had enough.

562
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,720
There are too many places to visit.

563
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,880
Mum.

564
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
That's "Tsuribaka Nisshi!"

565
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,520
"Hama-chan"

566
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
That's Hama-chan.

567
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,440
Captain realised
something wasn't right.

568
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,880
Yui?

569
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,200
- She isn't here.
- Indeed.

570
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Hello?

571
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,640
Hello, Captain.

572
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,560
Hello.

573
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,400
We've come to the Goto Islands.

574
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,320
Have you?

575
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,040
Don't laugh.

576
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,200
Miruku is feeling lonely,
so I didn't go.

577
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Who is Miruku?

578
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,280
- The dog I keep at home.
- A pet dog?

579
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,440
The pet dog is more important
than the expedition.

580
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,760
It can't be helped. Idiot!

581
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,880
Captain stands still for a while.

582
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm sad.

583
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,320
This is okay in 2021?

584
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,760
So Assistant Director Sakamoto
joins at the last minute,

585
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,000
and these are the team members.

586
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,880
They also recruited reliable help.

587
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,600
Mr Usui is a coordinator
who specialises in fishing.

588
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,560
He has gone around the world
and caught many giant fish.

589
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,120
We'll fish.

590
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
Around the Goto Islands,

591
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,120
various kinds of fish swim around
along the Tsushima Current.

592
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,520
Big fish gather in this ocean
to look for food.

593
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,080
When Miyagawa tries his fishing rod
before catching squid...

594
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,280
Got it!

595
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,480
I caught it!

596
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,160
He caught one right away.

597
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,920
And Mum also...

598
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,280
The fish he caught is...

599
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,280
It's huge!

600
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,920
It's a yellowtail amberjack,
rarely seen caught on television.

601
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,840
They are yellowtail amberjacks
in the Goto Islands!

602
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,840
Sakamoto also...

603
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,960
Amazing!

604
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
Good! It's huge!

605
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,480
It's huge! Look at the sea bream!

606
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,840
It's a giant sea bream that's rarely
seen caught on television.

607
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,720
This is the Goto Islands.

608
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
They will hunt bigfin reef squid
in this sea of abundance.

609
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,280
I want to catch one
that is too big to put in a pot.

610
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,680
A huge one, about as big as Yogibo.

611
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,560
I want to use it to make squid rice.

612
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,760
Finally, it's the bigfin reef squid.

613
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,440
They'll use a lure for squid
called squid jig.

614
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
We sink it down to the bottom,

615
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,840
then we jerk it up.

616
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,520
Then we sink it like this.
It's when the squid will hold it.

617
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,560
- It's holding rather than biting.
- Hold.

618
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,160
Bigfin reef squid
at the bottom of the sea

619
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,320
preys like it holds the food.

620
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,040
At that moment, the rod is pulled up
and the needle is hooked.

621
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,360
But when the squid bites,

622
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,800
it is only felt weakly
through the rod.

623
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
It feels like breaking
a mechanical pencil lead.

624
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,040
We have to catch it like that,
that's how delicate it is.

625
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,440
Captain noticed something was wrong
with the boat on the side

626
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,840
where the cameraman was on.

627
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,320
Omori!

628
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,360
What are you doing?

629
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
My trousers are wet!

630
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,440
You're in your underwear again!

631
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,680
Wait, why?

632
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,720
How many pieces of underwear
do you have?

633
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,680
Three.

634
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,280
You brought three pieces
of underwear?

635
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,000
What would make him wet?

636
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,400
I know the sea is rough.

637
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
They fished for 20 minutes,
but caught nothing.

638
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,680
Mr Usui can't stand watching it
and holds Miyagawa's hands to do it.

639
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,720
It bit!

640
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,080
I caught it.

641
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,840
But he caught the wrong squid.

642
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,960
This is a swordtip squid,
our target is a bigfin reef squid.

643
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Make sushi with this.

644
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,840
AD Sakamoto was trained
at a sushi restaurant last time,

645
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,480
and makes it into sushi there.

646
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,160
You broke its ink sac.

647
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,040
The sushi is going to be black.
Is this okay?

648
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,600
She broke the ink sac. Is it okay?

649
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,000
You removed the rice.

650
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,520
You pressed,
then removed the extra rice.

651
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,680
I haven't seen
sushi restaurants do that.

652
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,040
Here it goes.

653
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,760
But how does it taste?

654
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,520
Delicious!

655
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,320
- Squid dishes!
- Stop it!

656
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,800
You like that joke,
but we don't want it.

657
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,960
They also put out a boat at night,

658
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,320
but couldn't catch
any bigfin reef squid.

659
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,720
But attracted by the light
on the boat...

660
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,280
We caught a baby squid.

661
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
What? Really?

662
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,280
This is a baby bigfin reef squid.

663
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Oh, it's there.

664
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,960
- Squids die in one year.
- Is that so?

665
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,400
No matter how big the squid is,
they grow that big in one year.

666
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,000
When breeding season comes,

667
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,760
bigfin reef squid come
to shallow water from offshore,

668
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,800
and lay eggs on seaweed or rocks.

669
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,560
The shape of the eggs
is like field peas.

670
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,360
There are babies in each
of the pod-like rooms.

671
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,560
They grow into about
1 centimetre long in one month,

672
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,000
and leave the capsule.

673
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,040
Amazing.

674
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,640
So cute.

675
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,640
Mum's maternity can't stop.

676
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
- Mum! I know how she feels, though.
- Hey.

677
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,800
But babies have to be returned
to the sea.

678
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
I will free it.

679
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Take care.

680
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,320
"Rough"

681
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,480
Day two.

682
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,760
Strong wind at over 20 metres
per second blows in the morning.

683
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,280
Let's go back.

684
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,240
They can't fish at all and withdraw.

685
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,200
On this day, they go to the mountain
to get food ingredients.

686
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,840
This is mugwort, right?

687
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,320
Won't it be delicious
if we turn this into tempura?

688
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,040
Can we pick the root?

689
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,720
No, not the root, Mum.

690
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,840
Mum, are you hungry?

691
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,360
You heard tempura
and it made you hungry?

692
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,600
There's also a food ingredient
that's unique to the Goto Islands.

693
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,160
Is this camellia? What's this?

694
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,360
It's camellia.

695
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,800
People eat camellia
in the Goto Islands.

696
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,080
No way. What do they eat?
The leaves?

697
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,960
- They eat the flower.
- The flower.

698
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,760
The Goto Islands is one of Japan's
largest camellia-producing areas.

699
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,240
The seeds are used to make
its speciality, camellia oil.

700
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,640
The flower is made
into tempura for eating.

701
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,800
Found it.

702
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,160
It's amazing.

703
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,920
Anything to it cut with?

704
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,560
Yes, that's right.

705
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,920
Shuffle them like this.

706
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,320
Say stop. Okay, stop. Okay.

707
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,680
Say stop.

708
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,920
Stop! Okay.

709
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,880
Remember this.

710
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
Idiot!

711
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,280
Brilliant.

712
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,680
Not that!

713
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,720
I can't do anything with
playing cards.

714
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,120
Something to it cut with.

715
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,720
That's right.

716
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,760
Use this like this.

717
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,800
Yes.

718
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,800
He understands.

719
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,960
Where will you go?

720
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,840
Oh, Shimbashi? Okay.

721
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Okay.

722
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,000
Cut to the right.

723
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,040
Idiot.

724
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,680
He continues to cut.

725
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,160
That's wrong.

726
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,800
What can I do with this?

727
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,600
We have to wait until it falls,

728
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,080
then it won't be
the best time to eat!

729
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,560
Something to it cut with.

730
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,520
- I tried hard.
- You did.

731
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,840
That's right. This.

732
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
It's coming!

733
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,920
I boiled it for too long. No!

734
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,600
And...

735
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,840
You're fired up.

736
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,320
The noodles look tastier
than the flower.

737
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
"Nagasaki Champon noodles"

738
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,320
It makes me want the noodles.

739
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Oh, this one is nice.

740
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,200
They harvested
fresh camellia flowers,

741
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,560
and rented a local restaurant
in the afternoon,

742
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,760
and made lunch with
the food ingredients they got.

743
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,760
It's huge.

744
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,680
They used the fresh seafood
to make sashimi.

745
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,760
Sakamoto, look at how my hand moves.

746
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,400
Isn't it genius? It's nice.

747
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,640
"Yellowtail amberjack
caught yesterday"

748
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,480
A luxurious sashimi boat of squid,
sea bream, and yellowtail amberjack.

749
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Wow, it's gorgeous!

750
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,960
- Mum is making Goto Udon.
- She works there.

751
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,360
The sauce is made with dried flying
fish stock and squid ink.

752
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,360
It is served with
camellia and squid tempura.

753
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Let's dig in.

754
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,320
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

755
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,680
The noodles will get soggy,
let's start with the Goto Udon.

756
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
It looks delicious.

757
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,160
Goto Udon is thin.

758
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,400
Absolutely delicious!

759
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,680
The stock is so rich. Who made this?

760
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,200
It's amazing, Mum.

761
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,800
Next, it's yellowtail amberjack
sashimi.

762
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,160
It has to be good.

763
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,160
- It's fleshy.
- Fleshy.

764
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,000
It's fatty,

765
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,120
but it's light,
and the taste doesn't linger.

766
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,360
Lastly, it's the local cuisine,
camellia tempura.

767
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,760
What does it taste like?

768
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,600
Crunchy.

769
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,640
It has no taste.

770
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,480
"No taste"

771
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,400
Ridiculous.

772
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
It's crunchy tempura.

773
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,720
It's tasty.

774
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,480
Captain, something worries me.

775
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,480
What is it?

776
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,240
It doesn't look like
Miyagawa Expedition anymore.

777
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,640
I see.

778
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,800
Well, but...

779
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,080
It can't be helped.

780
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,800
Day three.

781
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,960
The weather recovered,
it's a perfect day for fishing.

782
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,400
They want to catch a bigfin
reef squid today no matter what.

783
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,640
I don't know if it'll be longer
than a person's height,

784
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,200
but they're there.

785
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,480
We want to catch them
no matter what.

786
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,160
I've been thinking passionately
since this morning.

787
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,480
Nobody has seen a bigfin reef squid
longer than a person's height,

788
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,680
so I want to show you.

789
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
I've been thinking passionately
since this morning.

790
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,520
Fishing starts. And then...

791
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,920
Something's wrong already.

792
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,920
- He's messing with us.
- Again?

793
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,280
He's messing with us at work.

794
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,680
You're giving Ryudomaru trouble.

795
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,000
No one will give Ryudomaru
jobs anymore.

796
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,080
My trousers are wet.

797
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,280
Come on, that doesn't matter.

798
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,120
Why do your wet trousers bother you?

799
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
But they caught bigfin reef squid
because of this.

800
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,680
It is caught by...

801
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,360
Caught it. Joji's catching it!

802
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,160
- Enjoji.
- You can do it.

803
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,880
He doesn't have seasickness
this time.

804
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,800
Yeah.

805
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Bigfin reef squid!

806
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,880
Its big fin looks like a round fan.

807
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,360
It proves that this
is a bigfin reef squid.

808
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,920
This is the most expensive
among squids,

809
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,120
one of this size costs 5,000 yen.

810
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,240
Good, Joji.

811
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,680
Also...

812
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
Enjoji caught another one.

813
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
He caught a second one in a row.

814
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,640
It's here! Isn't it huge?

815
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,720
He caught five squid consecutively.

816
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,400
Impressive!

817
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,800
- Really impressive.
- Really impressive.

818
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
I knew he was lucky.

819
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,400
He has been doing it for 15 years
since our festivals.

820
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,440
So far, in The Quest,

821
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,720
the highest rating we got
was filmed abroad,

822
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,600
"What happens if we let the
hairdresser decide the hairstyle?"

823
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,440
That got us the highest ratings.

824
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,600
It's shocking.

825
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,800
He has to be lucky.

826
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
He brightens up the atmosphere too.

827
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,200
It's unusual for you
to praise someone so much.

828
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,000
Well, I like that guy.

829
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,480
He also gets on my nerves,

830
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,320
but when I get annoyed,
I can tell him frankly.

831
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,040
I'm fortunate.

832
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
Where would you be
without Mr Enjoji, then?

833
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,280
I'd be here.

834
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,320
It isn't like that.

835
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,640
After that, Sakamoto caught
a swordtip squid.

836
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,240
Mum also caught a bigfin reef squid.

837
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,440
But Captain couldn't catch any.

838
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,520
Oh, no. I'm impatient.

839
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,960
But this happens when you fish.

840
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,360
How frustrating.

841
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,280
Even so, here is what
they caught this day.

842
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,480
None is longer
than a person's height,

843
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,960
but the filming is certainly
going well.

844
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,800
That night,

845
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,560
the team went to the city
to look for an open restaurant.

846
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,480
Wow, I'm curious about this place.

847
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
"Royal Pub...

848
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,960
Sharlock."

849
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,160
It looks like that at the back?

850
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,200
- Captain.
- Yes?

851
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,760
Holmes is there.

852
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,160
Sharlock and Holmes.

853
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,440
Anxious.
The Royal Pub in a strange city.

854
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,000
- Full of mystery.
- This place...

855
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,640
It's difficult to go inside.

856
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,080
Hey...

857
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,160
Joji. Go on.

858
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,400
"Sharlock."

859
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,280
It's surprisingly bright.

860
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,800
Okay? Really?

861
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,920
- May we come in and film?
- Go ahead.

862
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,480
Excuse me.

863
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,520
Oh, there's karaoke.
It's a nice pub.

864
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,720
Thank you.

865
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,480
Okay, let's have a seat, then.

866
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay.

867
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,400
Welcome.

868
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,280
Welcome to our pub.

869
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,360
What? Wait a minute. Mum?

870
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,920
I'm Sayuri.

871
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,920
Sayuri?

872
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,160
She looks like Mum.

873
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
She looks just like Mum.

874
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,200
- Do I?
- Yes.

875
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,560
You even have moles
at the same places.

876
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,360
Someone dressed the kimono for you?
You brought it here?

877
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,520
Yes, it's mine.

878
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Yours?

879
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,320
- How do I look?
- It suits you, but...

880
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,840
you got changed into that... Mum.

881
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,240
There's no need to show us
the back of your neck.

882
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,560
There's no need to turn 360 degrees.

883
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,840
On the final day,

884
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
they leave the port
when the sun rises.

885
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,280
Nice.

886
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,640
I swear, I'll catch a bigfin reef
squid longer than a person.

887
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,080
In the name of
the exploration party,

888
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,440
they can't let it end like this.

889
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,240
Sakamoto catches the first squid.

890
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,560
It's here--

891
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,480
What's this?

892
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,480
Wrong! What's this?

893
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,480
What's that? Its mouth is huge!

894
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,280
It's a fish called John Dory.

895
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,280
It swallows small fish whole
into its big mouth.

896
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,200
It isn't our target,
but it's good luck.

897
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,880
Nice, nice!

898
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,160
But after that, they couldn't catch
anything for seven hours.

899
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,320
You didn't catch anything
for three whole days.

900
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,160
It's tough,
I want to catch a squid too.

901
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,320
I have no idea what's wrong.

902
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,240
But even while not knowing
what's wrong,

903
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,720
they kept on catching squid.

904
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,320
I cheered at that time,

905
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,840
but inside, I thought,
"Get off the hook!

906
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,880
Don't catch squid before me!"

907
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,480
- Longer than a person?
- Not "longer than a person."

908
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,440
Which part are you talking about?
How old? Who?

909
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,080
It can be tiny, I just want
to catch one squid.

910
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,240
It can be tiny, I just want
to catch one squid.

911
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,440
Let's go somewhere else.

912
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,360
Casting a rod, then going elsewhere.

913
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,600
They keep repeating the process.

914
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,640
It's the period of patience.

915
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,320
Cheer for me.

916
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
Everyone, cheer for me.

917
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,320
You can do it.

918
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,880
At that time...

919
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
- It's here!
- Caught it.

920
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,360
The first one Captain catches
in three days.

921
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,320
Okay, this one is huge.

922
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Here it is,
it's longer than a person!

923
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,280
Everyone, it's longer
than a person's height!

924
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,640
See? It's huge!

925
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,120
Can he catch a bigfin reef squid?

926
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,840
It's huge, it's huge. Huge!

927
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,800
It's huge!

928
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,920
It's huge.

929
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,400
Yes!

930
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm happy.

931
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,080
He caught the bigfin reef squid
he's been wanting to catch.

932
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,560
The expedition party caught a total
of 22 bigfin reef squid.

933
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,080
The biggest one...

934
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
Oh, amazing.

935
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,280
It weighs 2.26 kilograms.

936
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,280
Impressive.

937
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,480
It is 94 centimetres long
when its tentacles are straight.

938
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,480
The big squid is longer
than a 3-year-old person.

939
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,080
Captain, it's big, right?

940
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,280
This is a little monster, right?

941
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,560
You don't catch one
like this often, right?

942
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
No.

943
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,560
Right?

944
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,600
But you must have been wondering
if any bigfin reef squid really

945
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,640
is longer than a person's height.

946
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,800
It is here.

947
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,280
It weighs 5 kilograms
and is 1.5 metres long,

948
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,000
it's a real monster.

949
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,480
We actually wanted to catch one
like this.

950
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,480
This is the biggest
bigfin reef squid we caught.

951
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,880
They'll end this
with making squid rice.

952
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,760
When I look at it again,
it's a bit big.

953
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,440
Also, I put it in ice,
so it shrank a bit.

954
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Also, when a squid's nerves are cut,

955
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,000
it turns into the colour
we're used to seeing in sushi.

956
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Thank you.

957
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,160
The gut is boiled
and added to rice with vinegar.

958
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,200
Stuff the squid with the rice.

959
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,840
It's heavy.

960
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,200
It's about the weight
of a water pillow.

961
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,280
It is ready after being cooked
in a special sauce for one hour.

962
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,280
Have a look at the cross section.

963
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,400
The squid is thick.

964
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,040
How does it taste?

965
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,480
Delicious!

966
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,120
It's absolutely delicious!

967
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,560
- It's surprisingly tender.
- Tender.

968
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,240
The rice is delicious too.

969
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,760
The tastiness of the seasoning
is monster-level.

970
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,480
Oh? That was a good comment.

971
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,640
It was a little monster,

972
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
but the taste is monster-level.

973
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,080
And it gradually shrank.

974
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,040
It shrank when we cooled it,

975
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,360
and shrank a lot after cooking.

976
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,000
That's all for Miyagawa Expedition.
