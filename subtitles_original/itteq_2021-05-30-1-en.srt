00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,680
"This show was broadcasted
on the 30th of May, 2021"

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,440
Welcome to The Quest.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,960
Today, it's Rare Beast Hunter
Imoto Japan Tour

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,560
and "The Quest" Calendar Project.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,680
Wasshoi!

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,720
Hello!

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,760
Hello!

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,040
Anpan!

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,360
This is how fireworks are made.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,240
We will finally launch them!

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,200
- Light it!
- Light it!

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,880
It's beautiful. Here I am.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
Hammerhead River!

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,040
They're so close. I'm impressed.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Aim to go around all 47 prefectures
in Japan,

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,960
Rare Beast Hunter Imoto
Japan Tour.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,120
The stage is Akita Prefecture,
the vast natural treasury

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
where Lake Tazawa and
the Shirakami Sanchi are located.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,280
Hello! Hello, hello.
I am Imoto.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,080
I'm now in Akita Prefecture.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,400
Where am I?

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,240
Let's do our regular search
for Imoto.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,400
- Beneath?
- Left.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,680
The blue demon.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
- I am here!
- No?

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,400
- Here! I'm over here!
- What?

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,160
The correct answer is,
I became part of the rock!

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,800
Oga, Akita's folk event,

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,720
Namahage.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
On New Year's Eve,

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,560
men romp around and yell,
"Are there any crybabies around?"

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,040
and ward off evil.

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,480
The commonly known part ends here,

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
but actually,
Namahage continues after that.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,280
Welcome.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Are you thirsty?
Please have a drink.

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,760
Namahage suddenly calmed down,

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,240
and received hospitality
from the house's owner.

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,240
Isn't that Imoto?

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,480
The Namahage knows who I am?

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,160
They take out a Namahage Record.

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,200
The residents' daily activities
are recorded.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,920
According to my record,
at this time,

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Imoto is doing intermittent fasting.

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
She does not have breakfast,

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,440
and during the day,

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,360
suddenly, her movements
and comments get worse.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,960
How does he know that?
How does he know I'm fasting?

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
- Hey, Imoto!
- Yes!

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Are you working seriously?

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,320
And it enters round two.

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,920
The house's owner reprimands them
and sends them back to the mountain,

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
so his wife and children
respect him,

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
and this lets the owner
maintain his dignity.

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,440
By the way, to bad-mouth you,

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,680
we asked Mr Ishizaki
the evil deeds you've done lately,

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,720
and he said that you don't turn
the toilet's light off

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,920
So cute!

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
What's that?

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,120
He said he couldn't think
of other things.

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,080
So cute!

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,720
I don't think it's okay for
a variety show's director, though.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
As a husband, he's perfect.

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,320
Now, let's start our tour in Akita.

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
Let's go to Akita!

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,000
We have come to Oga Aquarium, GAO.

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,080
In December 2020,

68
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,720
baby polar bears were born here.

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
I'll now go to meet them.

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,680
This is Mr Taguchi, the caretaker.

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
We haven't let the public meet them,

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,120
the two cubs have been staying with
their mother in the room inside.

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
I can't wait to see them.

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,080
They're unusually adorable.

75
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,200
- Irresistible?
- It's extraordinary.

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,360
Really?

77
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,080
But only one person can go in.

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,800
I'll take the responsibility

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,320
and go film something cute.

80
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,880
We entrusted Imoto
with the filming of the babies.

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,840
The babies are here.

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,240
But...

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
It's blurred.

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
- What?
- What happened?

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
- Why?
- Oh, no.

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,800
Focus on the bear.

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,160
Focus on the bear cub.

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,480
The iron bars look too clear.

89
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,080
Oh, no. It looks like it's filmed
with a stylish SLR Camera. No...

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,440
Oh, it's gone.

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
It's cute.

92
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
This is difficult.

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,440
But finally...

94
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
Oh, finally?

95
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,920
It's here.

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
The baby is coming here.

97
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,040
This is a 3-month-old
polar bear baby.

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
Wow, it looks like a plush toy.

99
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,320
It's so adorable.

100
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,640
The breeding of kept polar bears
is very difficult.

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,760
In Japan, only 30 cases
were raised successfully.

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm so excited.

103
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,000
It's growling.

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
It really loves its mum.

105
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,880
It's so adorable.

106
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,440
It becomes the idol of the zoo
in an instant. Irresistible.

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,480
Then, the iron bars become
the main star again.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,880
But there are many
adorable animals in Akita.

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,440
So cute!

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
That is Akita's protected animal.

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,280
Oh, it's nice to meet you!

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,320
This is an Akita.

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
It is big.

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,240
They are the Japanese dogs
designated as protected animals.

115
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
Among the six breeds,

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,240
Akita is the only large dog breed.

117
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,400
The famous loyal dog, Hachiko,
was also an Akita.

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,040
Recently, one was given
to Russia's President Putin,

119
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,760
and one to Ms Zagitova,
it's rather well-known.

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,960
- Masaru stayed here for a month,
- Okay.

121
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,040
The dog given to President Putin,
Yume's father, also came from here.

122
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr Motose is a great breeder
who is known by all Akita breeders.

123
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,720
There are some puppies Mr Motose
highly recommends now.

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,480
So cute!

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,760
Look at them.

126
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,440
So cute!

127
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
Have a look, everyone.

128
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,200
This is a 2-month-old Akita.

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
Was it tiny when it was born?

130
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
They weigh 350 to 400 grams
on average.

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,600
And they grow this big
in two months.

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
Look how thick its limbs are.

133
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
It's very sturdy.

134
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,800
You can bring it home.

135
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,680
I do want to bring it home.

136
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Asako doesn't want
to keep dogs anymore?

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right, I don't think
Asako wants that anymore.

138
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,320
Ms Okubo's dog, Pakomi,
ate the hair here,

139
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
Ayako said she was satisfied.

140
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,800
Pakomi kept tearing away
the hair here.

141
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,040
- So only the hair here is thin.
- Stop it.

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
Does Pakomi look down on her?

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,320
No, that's her toy.

144
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,480
Her toy.

145
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Next, it's Akita's food culture.

146
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm at a common supermarket
in Akita,

147
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,720
but look at this corner.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,640
They are all agar.

149
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,040
First, this is fruit agar,

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,840
this is milk agar.

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,280
I can somehow imagine
what these taste like,

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,960
and I think I've tried them before.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,920
But look at this.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,640
Shiitake mushroom agar.

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,240
What's this colour?
This is egg agar.

156
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,520
Like this, in Akita,

157
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,680
they use various things
to make agar.

158
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,960
In southern Akita,

159
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,960
it's their culture to turn

160
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,920
everything sweet or salty
into agar.

161
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,120
- Akita is a snowy place,
- Yes.

162
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,760
so it's mostly made as
a kind of preserved food.

163
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,680
The agar loved by people
of all ages is salad agar.

164
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,640
It looks delicious.

165
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,800
Add sugar and mayonnaise
to vegetables you like,

166
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
pour in melted agar,

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,360
and it's ready when it hardens.

168
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,720
Here I go.

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,640
Did she take it off? She did.

170
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
It's so beautiful!

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
So pretty!

172
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,560
- This looks so pretty!
- I want to try it.

173
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,840
- How does it taste?
- I want to try it.

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,680
Delicious.

175
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,000
- So good.
- I'm glad you like it.

176
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,480
It isn't watery at all.

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,480
- It's delicious!
- It's nice.

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,920
- Pretty and delicious.
- It's beautiful.

179
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,400
If you do the branding well
and sell it at a shop,

180
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,280
maybe you can earn a fortune.

181
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,160
I want to get involved.

182
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,400
You'll recover the cost
if you sell it at 500 yen.

183
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,520
While she films around the country,

184
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,840
this woman is always on the lookout
for business opportunities.

185
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
This is brilliant.

186
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,040
Yeah.

187
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
It's got to go well.

188
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,480
Let's make a sweet one.
The idea of crepes.

189
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
It's nice.

190
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Next, a summer feature in Akita.

191
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,400
We have come to Daisen City.

192
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,120
You're going to make fireworks.

193
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
What? You can make fireworks?

194
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,400
The fireworks festival held
in Omagari, Daisen City,

195
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,280
Nagaoka City in Niigata Prefecture,

196
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,080
and Tsuchiura City in
Ibara Prefecture,

197
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,760
are the three major
fireworks festivals in Japan.

198
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,520
This time, Imoto will make
her original fireworks

199
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,720
and launch them
into the sky in Akita.

200
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Hibikiya Omagari Fireworks'
president,

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Mr Saito, will help us.

202
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,120
Are fireworks dangerous?

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Sure, they are.

204
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,720
If there's static electricity.

205
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,000
No static electricity?

206
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
No.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Ms Imoto, you're wearing clothes
made with chemical fibres,

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
- there's a chance it'll explode.
- What?

209
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,200
If it goes, "boom,"
the whole workshop will be gone.

210
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,320
Like that?

211
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Scary.

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Before they go to the workshop,

213
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,640
Imoto changes into

214
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,280
pure cotton work clothes, which
doesn't cause static electricity.

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,560
Is your outfit okay?

216
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
It's pure cotton.

217
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Really?

218
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
If you explode, we'll all die.

219
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,280
- Have you checked the tag inside?
- I have.

220
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
Wait. Really?

221
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,320
"100 percent cotton."

222
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,600
The tag is so unique.

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,560
Oh, I don't like this.

224
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,400
I wanted her to wear this.

225
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,840
No fire is allowed beyond here,
so don't bring a lighter in.

226
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Mr Odani,
have you put down your cigarettes?

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Mine is electronic.

228
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,440
- Electronic too.
- Not allowed.

229
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,840
The first step is the composition
of gunpowder.

230
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,160
By mixing tens of chemicals,

231
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,800
it'll create various colours,
lights, and sounds.

232
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,400
There's a mixing ratio.
It varies from company to company.

233
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Different companies
have different ratios?

234
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,800
Next, it's granulation.

235
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,320
In a firework shell, there are
gunpowder pellets called stars.

236
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,880
The process of making
the stars is granulation.

237
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,560
Gunpowder dissolved in water
is used as glue,

238
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
and gunpowder is sprinkled on top.

239
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,160
The process is repeated many times.

240
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,760
They start as
1-millimetre granules,

241
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,920
we sprinkle gunpowder on top,
and they gradually grow bigger.

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,560
Does it take long
to make them this big?

243
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,560
It takes one month.

244
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,080
They're gone in six or seven
seconds.

245
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,560
So short-lived.

246
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
The stars made are stuffed
in a container called Tamagawa,

247
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,600
layers of craft paper are stuck
on top to finish it.

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,840
By the way, this is my wife.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Wow, this is your wife?

250
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,400
How did he propose to you?

251
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,960
He didn't propose.

252
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,360
He didn't launch any fireworks?

253
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
Didn't he talk about a big finale
and whatnot?

254
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,880
I have an older brother.
When I saw him do that,

255
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,400
I thought it was cringy.

256
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,720
Today, Imoto will do Tamagome,
loading the shell with stars.

257
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,000
- This is a number 3 shell?
- Yes.

258
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,520
It flies to about 100 metres
up in the air,

259
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,480
its diameter is 90 metres
when it explodes.

260
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,280
A diameter of 90 metres.

261
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,800
- The one you'll stuff today
- Yes?

262
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,960
is a number 10 shell.

263
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,120
- What?
- It's called Shakudama,

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
the diameter is 30 centimetres.

265
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,680
When it explodes,
it has a diameter of 300 metres.

266
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
It's launched in the second half

267
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,600
- to liven up the atmosphere?
- Yes.

268
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,440
Only number 5 shells
have been launched at Sumida River.

269
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,640
- Really?
- Yes.

270
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a city, there wasn't enough
safety distance,

271
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,920
so they can't launch big fireworks.

272
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Line up the finished stars inside
the Tamagawa without overlapping.

273
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,640
Is this okay?

274
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,080
Yes, perfect.

275
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,040
What about Mr Anzue?
He can do it too.

276
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,800
This is Mr Anzue who has been
a fireworks master for four years.

277
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,160
He stuffs a shell for the first time
today with Imoto.

278
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,560
Does it look okay?

279
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,240
It's also Mr Anzue's first time
making this.

280
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,440
When the shell
is 80 percent full of stars,

281
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
put a smaller Tamagawa shell in,

282
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,600
stuff the stars further
and leave no gap.

283
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,200
If you don't line them well here,

284
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,240
when it explodes, you'll see a seam.

285
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
There'll be a line.

286
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,680
But the height isn't uniform.

287
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,240
Mr Saito's is generally uniform.

288
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,760
Anzue's is uneven too.

289
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,440
Anzue needs to improve.

290
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,360
He has to start making an effort.

291
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,960
It's assumed that
making fireworks is bold,

292
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
but in fact, it's rather delicate.

293
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
Then we'll put Wariyaku,

294
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,640
that is the gunpowder that
scatters the stars in the centre.

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh, no... Again.

296
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,240
It has the sonority of sound.

297
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,360
It's nice. Listen to it.
It's when fireworks makers work.

298
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Isn't it the sonority of sound?

299
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Totally.

300
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
- The sound is nice.
- It's nice.

301
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
The Quest isn't over yet. Not yet.

302
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,040
Wrap the Wariyaku carefully
in Washi paper,

303
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,200
and half of it is finally finished.

304
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,160
This is half?

305
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Then, when the other half
of the shell is finished,

306
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,640
they'll finally be put together.

307
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,320
We'll put them together
at this angle.

308
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,680
- In one go?
- Yes.

309
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
It makes me very nervous.

310
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,640
I'm getting nervous too.

311
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
From this state...

312
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,840
If the content spills,
we have to start from scratch again.

313
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,080
Anzue will try first.

314
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Anzue.

315
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,160
- Okay.
- I'm so nervous.

316
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Can Anzue do it?

317
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,800
I'll do it.

318
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,160
- Oh, no.
- Anzue, you can do it!

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,440
Anzue!

320
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,000
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

321
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,600
They don't line up.

322
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,240
Oh, no.

323
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,400
Beat it and fix the position.

324
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
Can it be fixed?

325
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,040
It's okay.

326
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
Can this be used?

327
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,960
Anzue!

328
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Mr Saito mends it
and somehow finished it.

329
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,280
Next, it's Imoto's turn.

330
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
I'm scared.

331
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,480
- They're heavy.
- They are.

332
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't hold them any longer.
I'll do it!

333
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Ready, go.

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,040
Well done.

335
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,760
Anzue, sorry!

336
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,720
Imoto did rather well by imitation.

337
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,080
Okay.

338
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
She looks smug.

339
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,480
This time, she'll do one more thing.

340
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,560
It's the firework Imoto designs.

341
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
This is me.

342
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
- I think we can see this pattern.
- You can make it?

343
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,280
Shaped fireworks of pictures
or symbols are called Katamono,

344
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,600
they're made in a way totally
different from usual fireworks.

345
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
On a firework shell
with Wariyaku placed inside,

346
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,960
draft the picture of the firework
you want to launch.

347
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,040
Glue the stars according
to the picture.

348
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
Your brows are connected.

349
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
I guess so.

350
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,360
Unlike usual fireworks which are
round no matter where you look from,

351
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Katamono Firework isn't guaranteed
to face forward.

352
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Whether we'll see it as Imoto or not

353
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,800
will totally depend on luck.

354
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,080
This is done.

355
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,400
I've done it.

356
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,040
60 layers of craft paper are pasted
on the fireworks made.

357
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,200
By making the firework shell tough,

358
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,680
it'll create a strong pressure,
and it'll explode as a circle.

359
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,440
The firework Imoto made will be
launched five days later.

360
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,960
It costs 70,000 yen to launch
one big number 10 firework.

361
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,760
Yes, it costs about 70,000 yen.

362
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,280
- We want a lot if possible.
- Thank you.

363
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,720
We have to talk
to our show's producer.

364
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,480
While the craftspersons are working,

365
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,400
we'll report about
Akita's traditional performance art.

366
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Wow, impressive! What's that?

367
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,120
Wow, what's this?

368
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,720
Huge lanterns are hung on a pole,

369
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,880
he's supporting the pole
with his forehead.

370
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,920
This is Akita's traditional
performance art, Kanto.

371
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,480
The pole on which the lanterns are
hung can be as long as 18 metres.

372
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
It is perfectly balanced,

373
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
and the amazing feat has been
passed down since the Edo period.

374
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,560
It's bent so much!

375
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
Amazing!

376
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,840
Every August,
to pray for abundant harvest,

377
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,120
around 280 poles bearing lanterns

378
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,880
are featured
in the Akita Kanto Festival.

379
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,280
The scene is praised as the lights

380
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,640
of ears of rice
that decorate summer.

381
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,480
Now, Imoto will try it too.

382
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,840
This is a Kanto of a size
called Chuwaka,

383
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,080
which is held by middle school
students in the festival.

384
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,200
Ready, go.

385
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,440
Oh, no.

386
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
This is bad.

387
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,240
There's no way I can do it.

388
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,240
It looks light, right?

389
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,160
It's heavy if you hold it.

390
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,120
It looks easy
when the performers hold it,

391
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,360
but it weighs 30 kilograms.

392
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,680
You can't do it only by strength.

393
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,040
Four parts strength,
six parts skill.

394
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,520
Skill is more important?

395
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,640
The balance is more important.

396
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
Proving it,

397
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,600
the festival executive committee's
president is 71 years old,

398
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,520
but his performance doesn't look it.

399
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,360
It's impressive.

400
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,920
Imoto is influenced by him,

401
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,160
her talent suddenly bloomed.

402
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,760
Hold it up quickly if possible.

403
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,760
Okay. Keep holding it up.

404
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,560
- Hold it up.
- Suddenly?

405
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,800
Impressive!

406
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
I can't...

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
Dokkoisho, dokkoisho.

408
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,840
Dokkoisho, dokkoisho.

409
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,640
- Sorry, help me.
- Watch out.

410
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
I could do it, surprisingly.

411
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,640
Try to do an even more difficult
performance, then.

412
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
I think I know what this is.

413
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,360
- This is a gym wheel.
- Gym wheel.

414
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,040
Rhonrad uses this wheel to perform
various techniques,

415
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
it's a sport that originated
in Germany.

416
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,200
Scary!

417
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,880
Mr Yasuhiko Takahashi here

418
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,680
is the current world champion
of Rhonrad.

419
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,840
His body is strong.

420
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Also, he was the world champion
not just once, but three times,

421
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,560
and he's the world's
number 1 Rhonrad athlete.

422
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,040
Awesome!

423
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,520
Wow, impressive!

424
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,360
How does he do it?

425
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,840
He absolutely wins. The champion.

426
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
You do it gracefully,

427
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,760
but you use a lot of muscles
to do this, right?

428
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,680
That's right.

429
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,400
I use many muscles.

430
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,440
As usual, Imoto tries it, but...

431
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,000
- Oh, no.
- I'll let go.

432
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,720
She can't do it at all.

433
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,440
Please watch the performance of only
the techniques Imoto can do.

434
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
You did it.

435
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,000
It's too early.

436
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,840
I practised a bit.

437
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
Here she is.

438
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,960
So slow.

439
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,920
This is impressive.

440
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,880
You only ran on the ground.

441
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
The reassuring spin.

442
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,840
This is impressive!

443
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,880
Amazing!

444
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,840
Impressive.

445
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,760
Gosh, the form...

446
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,760
I'm so embarrassed!

447
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
Embarrassed.

448
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,960
Lastly, a large spin
by Mr Takahashi.

449
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,400
This is tough in its own way.

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,960
The strength.

451
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,080
She has to endure it.

452
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,880
There's a bit of comedy added.

453
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
On the other hand,
it's the launching of fireworks.

454
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,520
We managed to get
the production cost

455
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,960
for the Special Fireworks Festival
of The Quest,

456
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
and secured an 800,000 yen budget.

457
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,240
Thank you.

458
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,640
They are the instructions
for each launch.

459
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
- So many are written.
- That's right.

460
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,360
To sum up,

461
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,080
- one square is one firework, right?
- Yes.

462
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,600
We'll launch a lot.

463
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,440
It's about 300 to 400 fireworks.

464
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
It's more than the number launched
at my hometown's fireworks festival!

465
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
This is the gunpowder for launching.

466
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,080
- We'll put it underneath?
- Yes.

467
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,640
Put it at the bottom,

468
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,360
and put the shell on top.

469
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,680
- That's all?
- Yes.

470
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,320
This amount of gunpowder will send
it up to 300 metres in the air.

471
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,520
In the past, a fire source was
placed in by hand to launch it.

472
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Nowadays, we use an electric fuse.

473
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,560
When the current flows,
there will be a spark at the tip.

474
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,280
Finally, they'll launch
the fireworks.

475
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,360
The Special Fireworks Festival
of The Quest starts now.

476
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,280
One!

477
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,280
- Light it!
- Light it!

478
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,720
Beautiful!

479
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
Wow, nice!

480
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,680
Wow, impressive! What's this?

481
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,440
It's amazing, wow!

482
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,640
- This is a fireworks festival.
- Amazing!

483
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,800
Amazing!

484
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,000
How much did
the opening just now cost?

485
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,200
The amount?

486
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,680
- About 200,000 yen.
- Ask how many fireworks.

487
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Instead of money.

488
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,520
It's ephemeral.

489
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,520
Well, then,

490
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,680
- let's launch the Imoto Smile
- Finally.

491
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
- we loaded the other day.
- Please.

492
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,480
Ignite Imoto Smile.

493
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,920
First, it's Imoto's face
loaded by Mr Saito.

494
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
"Imoto Smile by Mr Saito"

495
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,840
- Good! Good! Good!
- It's perfect!

496
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,800
You saw it?

497
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,200
It was great.

498
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Its brows were connected.

499
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,360
They were. They were connected,
but it's well made!

500
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,800
What about the face Imoto made?

501
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,440
"Imoto Smile by Imoto"

502
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,920
That was so Imoto Smile!

503
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,360
Its brows were also connected.

504
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Yes, they were.

505
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,800
- Anzue's.
- Mr Anzue's!

506
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,840
- Mr Anzue's Imoto Smile.
- Yes.

507
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,200
"Imoto Smile by Anzue"

508
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,400
It's the side?

509
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,440
It faced the side!

510
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
- They're different.
- Are you kidding me?

511
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,520
- Finally, the Shakudama.
- Here it is.

512
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,680
- The Shakudama I made.
- Yours. Okay.

513
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,400
The sound is different.

514
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
"Shakudama by Mr Saito"

515
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Beautiful!

516
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,800
Beautiful.

517
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
It's huge!

518
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,600
"Imoto"

519
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,640
This is how big it is
compared to a person's size.

520
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,840
It's like the ground rumbled!
Is this okay?

521
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,720
Next, it's Anzue's.

522
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,960
- His first.
- His first Shakudama.

523
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,560
- Here we go, Mr Anzue.
- Okay.

524
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,240
Your first Shakudama.

525
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,880
"Shakudama by Anzue"

526
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,600
Wonderful! It changes colour!

527
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,080
How do you feel now?

528
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,680
I'll continue to do my best to load
fireworks even better than this.

529
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
It was beautiful.

530
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,360
To me, it looked the same
as Mr Saito's.

531
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,720
Mine was rounder.

532
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Oh, was it?

533
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Well...

534
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,720
Fireworks explode into a circle
no matter where you see it from.

535
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,000
That's where fireworks masters
show off their skills.

536
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
When we compare them,
it's as you can see.

537
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,040
"By Mr Saito, by Anzue"

538
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,960
Indeed.

539
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,240
Finally, they'll launch
Imoto's Shakudama.

540
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,960
Next, ignite...

541
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,400
the Silvery Purple Brocade Profusion
I made.

542
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,760
It was so beautiful.

543
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
It was great!

544
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,240
It was very round.

545
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
Maybe it was better than ours.

546
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,360
Yes, somehow, I feel that it was
as well.

547
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,760
I think it was the roundest.

548
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,480
Lastly, it's a Star Mine that costed
all the remaining budget.

549
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,560
Ignite!

550
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,320
It's coming.

551
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
Amazing.

552
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,840
Amazing.

553
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,440
Beautiful! Amazing!

554
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,120
Wow, beautiful!

555
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,560
It's so beautiful! Amazing!

556
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,720
Is this okay?

557
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,400
Is the budget okay?

558
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,640
Wait, is our budget okay?

559
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,840
- Wow, amazing!
- Don't ask about the budget.

560
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,080
They're drooping!

561
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,600
It's enough. Wow, amazing!

562
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,640
This is bad! Mr Saito!

563
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,400
That's the end.

564
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,840
Amazing!

565
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
The last one is your favourite,
Nishiki Kamuro, Ms Imoto.

566
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,360
The drooping one.

567
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,240
Didn't we launch too many?

568
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

569
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,960
Is our budget sufficient?

570
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,800
I got scared at the end,

571
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,960
we kept launching, right?

572
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,160
What do you think this time,
Mr Anzue?

573
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,080
The number 10 firework shell I made

574
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,040
- looked small.
- What?

575
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,960
So you were happy,
but you weren't totally satisfied?

576
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,280
There's much room for improvement.

577
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,160
Maybe some people
will become Mr Anzue's fans.

578
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
If anyone asks Anzue
to make fireworks,

579
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,920
we'll launch his fireworks.

580
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
Really?

581
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,600
That's the 15th prefecture,

582
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,640
Akita Prefecture conquered.

583
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,680
I thought it was great and was
impressed across the screen,

584
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,840
but Ms Imoto
only talked about money.

585
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,000
"How much is this? Is it okay?
Is our budget sufficient?"

586
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,520
Just enjoy it quietly.

587
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Mr Anzue also made his debut.

588
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,240
Yes, the gentleman was very pure.

589
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,360
Nice, Anzue!

590
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
- Anzue is nice.
- I like his name too.

591
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,760
- You want to say, "Anzue!"
- Anzue!

592
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,080
Anzue.

593
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,720
The next part is this.

594
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
"The Quest" Calendar Project!

595
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,440
This time, to take a photo with
a certain kind of rare animal,

596
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,400
I went to the sea in Izu.

597
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,680
Izu.

598
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,880
I exposed the secrets
of Izu's diving industry!

599
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,600
Secrets?

600
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,400
- We don't need that!
- But...

601
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,720
Don't expose them!

602
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,040
Members of The Quest go to various
places in the world every month

603
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,320
to take beautiful photos.

604
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,760
They aim to collect the photos
to complete the 2022 calendar.

605
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,680
This is
"The Quest" Calendar Project.

606
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,960
This time,
we'll go to a sea in Japan,

607
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,080
and try to take photos
of a kind of rare animal.

608
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,480
A rare animal?

609
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
It's sunfish.

610
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,920
Sunfish.

611
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,760
The maximum length of
the giant sunfish is 3 metres.

612
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,120
It is popular at aquariums because
of its lovely appearance,

613
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,720
but it is rare to see them
swimming in the ocean.

614
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
In the past, in The Quest,

615
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,160
Imoto had been to a sea
in Indonesia to look for them,

616
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,480
but couldn't find any.

617
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,520
In the end, she went to a place
in Chiba called Manbo Land,

618
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
- and swam with them.
- I see.

619
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
You recovered it that way...

620
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,800
It's a cringy way to end,
but well...

621
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
What The Quest left behind

622
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,920
will be recovered by
the sea traveller, Oceans Kaneko.

623
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,720
Ocean sunfish have been sighted at
a place from time to time recently,

624
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,760
that is the Izu Peninsula in winter.

625
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,680
So this time, we'll travel around
the sea in Izu

626
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
to look for sunfish.

627
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,120
Let's carry out the Izu
Ocean Sunfish Great Operation.

628
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,560
Oceans Kaneko has come
to the sea in Izu!

629
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,640
Chacha manbo, chacha manbo!

630
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,880
He has come to the southern tip
of Izu Peninsula, Minamiizu Town.

631
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,840
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

632
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
Nice to meet you.

633
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,880
His guide is an experienced diver,
Junji Suda.

634
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,720
He had sighted sunfish many times
in the past.

635
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,720
Nice.

636
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,760
But lately...

637
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,400
- Twice in three months.
- What?

638
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
That's so few.

639
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,520
Sunfish likes cold water,

640
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,520
so they appear in the area
of the sea in Izu during winter.

641
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,400
But in that time period,

642
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,920
they don't always stay
at the same place,

643
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,560
and it's said that they swim
around along the coast.

644
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,440
But there are places where you have
many reports of sighting, right?

645
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,720
There are several places.

646
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,600
Let's use our usual strategy.

647
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,320
We'll sail a boat,

648
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,280
and dive while we're moving.

649
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,520
I want to do that,

650
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,720
but we can't.

651
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,680
- What?
- Yes.

652
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,400
Why is that?

653
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,480
I heard music.

654
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,840
The thing that is in the way
of our search

655
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,280
is the secret hidden
in Izu's diving industry.

656
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,360
Here it goes.

657
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,840
As one of the best diving spots
in Japan,

658
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,880
there are many points
that surround the peninsula,

659
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,880
but shops that can dive at
each point are specified,

660
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,240
and other people aren't allowed
to step into the area.

661
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,240
This is their unspoken rule.

662
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,680
Like, this point is this shop's,
that point is that shop's.

663
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,000
Is there any point you want?

664
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,840
There are places I'd like to go to.

665
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,000
Do you hand them over
to other people?

666
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,280
We don't do that.

667
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,360
- You all have your territories.
- Yes.

668
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
This is like
the Warring States period,

669
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
- like battling over territories.
- Yes.

670
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,880
On the stage of Izu's sea where
invisible boundaries are put up,

671
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,520
a fierce battle has finally started.

672
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,120
The font.

673
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,120
That's enough.

674
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,360
"Project Q, Izu Sunfish Operation"

675
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,680
A unwritten agreement
in Izu's diving industry,

676
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,360
a non-aggression pact of points.

677
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,640
The territory of the shop
where Suda works

678
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
is 15 minutes away
from the port by boat,

679
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
at the sea of Mikomoto Island.

680
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,000
It's one of the best diving spots
in Izu.

681
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,040
If it's one of Izu's best,
that means it's one of Japan's best.

682
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,680
That's right, I shouldn't be
the one to say it, though.

683
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,920
It is the southernmost point
of Izu Peninsula.

684
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,720
The Kuroshio Current
relatively comes easily,

685
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,720
so small fishes gather there,

686
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,440
and big fishes go there
to hunt them.

687
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,560
Suda has Mikomoto Island,

688
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,960
so he is the winner
in Izu's diving industry.

689
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,240
The huge cruise that has a capacity
of 62 passengers is the proof.

690
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,240
- We're here.
- We're here?

691
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,920
Yes, this is Mikomoto Island.

692
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,080
No plant grows there.

693
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,960
On the sea
in the winner's territory,

694
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,040
they go scouting.

695
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,800
Amazing!

696
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,800
I see a large school of fish
right away. That's a lot.

697
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
The school of fish blocking his
sight is Japan's endemic species,

698
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,480
yellowstriped butterfish.

699
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,720
People call Mikomoto Island
the Paradise of School of Fish.

700
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,040
Various species of small fish
are shoaling everywhere.

701
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,200
A huge one is coming.

702
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,120
Oh, greater amberjack!

703
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
They're hunting these fish.

704
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,400
Usually, greater amberjack
is about 1 metre long,

705
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,320
but at Mikomoto Island,

706
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,120
individuals that are nearly
2 metres long have been sighted,

707
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
so it is obvious how abundant
this area of the sea is.

708
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,440
The sea is amazing.

709
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,720
Izu is huge.

710
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,120
With that momentum,
they go search for sunfish.

711
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,040
Come out, sunfish.

712
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,080
Oh, sunfish!

713
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,280
The chance of seeing sunfish
in Izu's mid-winter

714
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,640
will be several days
during spring tide.

715
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Riding the rising current
from the deep sea,

716
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,600
the sunfish' favourite food,
squid and jellyfish, will surface.

717
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,680
It is said that sunfish come
to shallow waters to hunt them.

718
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,960
The chance will be the coming
four days starting today.

719
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,160
There's no sunfish.

720
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,840
There are small fish, though.

721
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,080
They did not find any sunfish
this day,

722
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,240
but Kaneko witnessed a phenomenon
that is rare in the world.

723
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,400
Wow, impressive!

724
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,480
That's a huge number
of hammerhead sharks!

725
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,520
They're very close. I'm impressed.

726
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,160
All divers long to see
the swarm of hammerhead sharks,

727
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,320
that is a Hammerhead River.

728
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,440
Impressive!

729
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,840
In the past,

730
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,360
Kaneko went to the sea of
Costa Rica in Central America

731
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,240
to try to film this,

732
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,040
but he couldn't see this sight.

733
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,480
Hurray!

734
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,520
The hammerhead sharks
are impressive!

735
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,000
Now, he will certainly get
many enquiries from customers.

736
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,480
Even if sunfish come after this,

737
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I think it won't be as good as this.

738
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,760
Suda couldn't stop laughing.

739
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
It isn't about money. Stop it!

740
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,960
- Stop it.
- I'm sorry.

741
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,560
They did not encounter any sunfish
on the first day,

742
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,320
so they followed Izu's rule
and arranged another guide.

743
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,080
They'll go there by car tonight.

744
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,880
Along the way,

745
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,720
they talk about the happy things
that happened to Kaneko lately.

746
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,080
Last time in The Quest,

747
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,520
you introduced
Kaneko Takatoshi channel, right?

748
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,720
Hello, I am Takatoshi Kaneko.

749
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,760
At that time, I had 500 subscribers,

750
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,760
but Kaneko Takatoshi channel...

751
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,640
has over 10,000 subscribers now!

752
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,040
Thank you.

753
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,040
What videos have you been
uploading recently?

754
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,560
I live streamed when I cooked,

755
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,640
and my happy birthday the other day.

756
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,360
Daddy, happy birthday!

757
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,480
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

758
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,680
Thank you!

759
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,520
How long is the video?

760
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,520
About less than an hour.

761
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,600
You show your viewers that
for an hour?

762
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,400
What do you mean?

763
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,560
Kaneko Family's home video
is left there to play.

764
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,880
The number of subscribers reduced
by 2,000 soon after that.

765
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,920
Reduced!

766
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,920
My father is very kind...

767
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,880
"Daddy Taka's 43rd birthday party"

768
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,240
Our family is proud of him.

769
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,600
Kaneko Takatoshi channel.

770
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,720
Day two of searching.

771
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,520
Our guide today is located in
the eastern part of Izu Peninsula,

772
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,400
Ito Diving Service's Yoshio Sawachi.

773
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,720
His website says this is a sea
where sunfish show up, but...

774
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,640
But...

775
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,000
Have you seen sunfish this year?

776
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,520
- I haven't seen any this year.
- What?

777
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,680
Are you kidding me?

778
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,480
It's still mid-February now, but...

779
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,760
Yes, maybe today will be
the first time we see them.

780
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,800
The boat's size also makes us worry.

781
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,640
It isn't about the size.

782
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,280
The search starts.

783
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,240
He's helping us.

784
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,240
There are a lot of small fish.

785
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,200
It's beautiful.

786
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,800
Here I am.

787
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,280
A swarming school of golden sweeper.

788
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,720
People call it Silver Flash.

789
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
The sight is beautiful,

790
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,680
but seeing this today isn't
worth being happy about.

791
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
Is that so?

792
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,880
The sunfish we are searching for

793
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,200
likes the temperature of water
to be under 15 degrees Celsius.

794
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,120
But in front of our eyes,
besides golden sweepers,

795
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,080
fish that aren't usually seen
in cold season are shoaling.

796
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,240
I see.

797
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,120
The temperature of water
is two degrees higher than usual.

798
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,040
Sawachi made a confession

799
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
of such important information
after they dived.

800
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,120
He says it in a nasty way.

801
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,040
The temperature of the water
is a bit high.

802
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,960
- It's high?
- That's nasty.

803
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,280
But I think they're
just around the corner.

804
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,960
Already...

805
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,360
Where is around the corner?

806
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,120
Really... Edit it again!

807
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,240
There are invisible boundaries
in the sea of Izu,

808
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,240
but there is a way to break them.

809
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,120
Hello, good evening.

810
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,240
I'm Oceans Kaneko.

811
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,720
Guides gather for a remote meeting
without crossing boundaries.

812
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,240
Has anyone been informed
of the sighting of sunfish lately?

813
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Oh, Mr Kanazashi!

814
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,880
Kanazashi, who looks scary,

815
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,560
is a diver in Shobuzawa, East Izu.

816
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,880
- You saw them?
- Scary?

817
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
I didn't see them,

818
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,440
but there are fixed nets
at the coast of Shobuzawa,

819
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,520
they often get caught in the nets.

820
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,760
Also, in Futo, East Izu...

821
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,400
There are also fixed nets
off the coast of Futo,

822
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,720
and three were caught there
last week.

823
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,240
That means

824
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,720
there's a chance I will see
a sunfish?

825
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,240
- Just a chance, though.
- A chance.

826
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,480
What should I do?
I only have two days left.

827
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,680
Which one is the best point
to start?

828
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,080
In East Izu.

829
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,240
It's a huge responsibility.

830
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,760
Nobody... nobody is confident.

831
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
In fact,
the sea in East Izu is often rough,

832
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,960
so they can't even put out a ship.

833
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,640
Tago is in West Izu, right?

834
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,200
Yes, it's West Izu.

835
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,040
How will Tago be
in the next two days?

836
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,680
I think the condition will be good.

837
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,120
Is there a chance
I'll see a sunfish?

838
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,360
No.

839
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,920
"Project Q, Izu Sunfish Operation"

840
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,160
That's enough.

841
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,960
Day three of the search.

842
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,440
They came to the small port city
of Futo.

843
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,080
Is that the fixed net?

844
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,840
Yes, the fixed net I told you
about yesterday.

845
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,760
I see.

846
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,720
It's the fixed net that caught
three sunfish last week.

847
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,800
Today, around this area...

848
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
We'll dive and look for sunfish.

849
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
Search for them.

850
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,120
Sunfish is an animal
that is usually found alone,

851
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
if several appeared here,

852
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,800
maybe this is where they find food.

853
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,960
But contrary to our expectation,

854
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,200
no matter how long they dived,
their presence isn't felt.

855
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,200
Have you seen a sunfish?

856
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
"Japanese bullhead shark"

857
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,480
I'd like to see sunfish.

858
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,160
Diving in the freezing cold winter.

859
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,720
- Hot spring?
- Hot spring.

860
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,640
Hot spring!

861
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,160
The divers brought hot spring water
from near the port on board,

862
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,920
and make their bodies warm.

863
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,800
It makes me feel your kindness.

864
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,720
You pour warm water
on each other's backs.

865
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,080
The surrounding people tease him,

866
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,720
but there's already someone
in Odani's mind.

867
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,080
Mr Odani! Today is Valentine's Day.

868
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,760
Happy Valentine's Day.

869
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
How about Ms Hayashi?

870
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,240
Ms Hayashi!

871
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,400
When we filmed abroad,

872
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,040
you gave me a present
on my birthday.

873
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,520
What the heck?

874
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,000
Ms Hayashi!

875
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,440
He looks happy! He looks happy.

876
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,760
It's a heart shape

877
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,720
handmade chocolate
with his name written on it.

878
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,280
I don't remember the last time
I received chocolate.

879
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,640
What? Really?

880
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
Odani thought,

881
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,920
"Could she be serious about me?"

882
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,440
This is yours, Mr Kaneko.
Thank you as always.

883
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,400
Happy Valentine's Day.

884
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,640
What?

885
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,440
Okay, Happy Valentine's Day!

886
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
Gosh...

887
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,840
What the heck?

888
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,040
Day four of the search.

889
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,240
There has been an out-of-season
heavy rain since morning.

890
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,240
Oh, no.

891
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,880
To make things worse,
the strong wind makes the sea rough.

892
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
This is bad.

893
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,080
They put out a boat, but...

894
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,800
We'll stop here today.

895
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,760
- We'll end here today?
- It's dangerous.

896
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,920
That's right.

897
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,440
Their four-day challenge failed,

898
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,680
but there's no way
they can give up completely.

899
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,080
The next spring tide
will be in late February.

900
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,280
Late February?

901
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,440
I will be available.

902
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,400
We know.

903
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,200
Then, in late February.

904
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,520
The last guide we turned to was...

905
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,360
Sawachi and his little boat.

906
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,440
Compared to last time,

907
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,880
the temperature of the sea
in Ito dropped,

908
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,280
- and the condition improved.
- I see.

909
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,400
It's been a long time since we
last met. I'm looking forward to it.

910
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,760
Looking forward to it.

911
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,960
What?

912
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,440
Ms Ishihara, why are you here?

913
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,080
- I've come to help.
- You came to help.

914
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,320
The boundary of Izu's sea
has just been broken.

915
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,520
Has this happened before?

916
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,920
I don't think so.

917
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,120
Amazing!

918
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,120
Isn't it amazing?

919
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,920
Ishihara wasn't the only one
who showed us her passion.

920
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,320
Mr Kaneko.

921
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,320
I'll go sailing for the first time
in a while to look for sunfish.

922
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I'll do my best!

923
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,360
I'll go to look for them too!

924
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,080
Off I go.

925
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,120
Divers at various places in Izu

926
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,320
go to their own area of the sea.

927
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,160
Ms Ishihara is also making
desperate effort to search.

928
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,960
Yamada in Atami

929
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,480
searches at the point
of a sunken ship.

930
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,440
In the past, sunfish have been seen
here many times.

931
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,400
At the same time in Osezaki,

932
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,160
Maki found wood like this at
the Torii gate at the sea's bottom.

933
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,520
If it's like this,

934
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,360
it doesn't matter who it is,

935
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,680
so if you see a sunfish,

936
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,000
please film it.

937
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,520
- Okay.
- Okay, understood.

938
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,960
Thank you.

939
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,000
In Shobuzawa,
Kanazashi with a scary face

940
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,120
arranged an underwater
photographer himself.

941
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,920
The chance will come
only for a second,

942
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,240
we cannot afford to miss it.

943
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,480
Please. Let a miracle happen.

944
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
There is only the slightest chance.

945
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,280
Even so, everyone continues to try.

946
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,840
A total of 11 people,

947
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,440
and a total of 100 diving sessions.

948
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,520
The effort finally pays off.

949
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,800
The lucky one is...

950
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,640
Okay, this time,
I will go to film the sunfish!

951
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,200
- Please!
- Amazing.

952
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,280
It's Kaneko, Sawachi and Ishihara
searching in Ito.

953
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,320
The water is very clear.

954
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,200
It was when they used a rope
to go to the bottom of the sea.

955
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,480
Oh, sunfish!

956
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,080
There's a sunfish!
There's a sunfish!

957
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,240
Sunfish!

958
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,480
There's a sunfish!

959
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,640
Oh, my gosh! A miracle!

960
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,160
Miracle! Miracle!

961
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,040
There's a sunfish.

962
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,400
A sunfish suddenly appeared
in front of his eyes.

963
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,600
It is about 1 metre long,

964
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,560
and it certainly isn't big,

965
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,000
but it has a presence.

966
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,840
It's cute, and its eyes are big.

967
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,240
It sways its fins vertically.

968
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,240
The sunfish uses its dorsal fin
and rear fin to swim leisurely.

969
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,280
How lovely it is.

970
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,200
So cute.

971
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,960
It does not move
even when a human is nearby,

972
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,360
and leisurely swims
together with him.

973
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,520
Thank you.

974
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,040
Thank you, the god of the sea.

975
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,960
Amazing!

976
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,760
Kaneko wasn't the only one
who had a happy moment.

977
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,440
This is filmed by Kanazashi
in Shobuzawa.

978
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,880
He caught a sunfish swimming
in the transparent blue sea.

979
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,480
Amazing!

980
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,640
In Jogasaki,
Yakita also saw a sunfish...

981
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,880
swimming together and successfully
filmed this rare sight.

982
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,240
Hurray! The Ocean Sunfish
Great Operation is successful!

983
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,840
Oh, it has gone far away.

984
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,960
The sunfish showed up in front
of us for only two minutes.

985
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,840
Even so, the time was like a dream.

986
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,400
Mr Sawachi!

987
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,520
What a surprise! I was surprised.

988
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,680
He uploaded so many photos
of the sunfish on his website,

989
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,360
but Sawachi was the one
who's the most surprised.

990
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,280
That's nasty.

991
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,480
We could do this because everyone
in Izu worked together.

992
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,640
We made it!

993
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,000
So the photo to be used
for the calendar

994
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,600
will be this one, which features
Kaneko and the sunfish.

995
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,000
Actually, the Hammerhead River

996
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,440
is more suitable to be put
into the calendar,

997
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,240
but we got too many shops involved,

998
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,800
so we're forced to choose this.

999
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,080
That's all for the Izu
Ocean Sunfish Great Operation.

1000
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,280
Isn't the narration
even nastier than usual?

1001
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,800
And they made Mr Tomorowo read it.

1002
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,200
Exactly!

1003
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,680
Mr Tomorowo,
you can turn down the job.

1004
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,960
You can say,
"No, I can't do this narration."

1005
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,600
Mr Tomorowo, it'll hurt you too.
