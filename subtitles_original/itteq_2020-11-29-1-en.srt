1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,680
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,200
First up is a popular segment,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,920
Degawa travel guidebook.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,720
It will take place
in Yaeyama Islands,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,560
which are 400 km away from
the Okinawa mainland.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,240
Degawa has visited
this area several times,

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,800
and he boasts
that it's like a backyard to him.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,880
Ishigaki Island,

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,800
Taketomi Island, Iriomote Island,

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,840
Kohama Island,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,760
and Kuroshima Island.
That area is known for

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,160
its beautiful ocean
and beautiful islands.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,720
There's a lot of them.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,960
He proudly proclaims
what is common knowledge.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,800
Why do you go there?

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,120
It's because I like it.

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,840
Only reason I go to the island is

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,960
because I love it.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,120
When a mountain climber is asked
why they climb a mountain,

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,080
"Because it's there."

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Why do people go to an island?

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,400
It's because they love it.

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,680
Well, but with this example,
it should be "Because it's there."

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,080
His travel companion is Madam Dewi.

25
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,040
Why would you use this picture?

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
I would like you to take a picture
of Madam Dewi for a calendar.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,640
I see. I see.

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,920
It won't just be a calendar.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,360
It's going to be a collection
of photographs.

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,160
The last collection of photographs
before her death.

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,520
Dewi and Degawa's trip.

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,120
How will the calendar turn out?

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,280
"This program was broadcast
29 November 2020"

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,720
The Quest has started. Tonight,
we have Degawa travel guidebook

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,840
and Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Yeah!

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
So we have Degawa travel guidebook.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
So, Madam, how was it to go
on location with him?

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
Tetsuro said it's like his backyard,

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,080
but there were so many things
he didn't know.

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,560
- You shock me! Come on!
- He's just like me.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
You immediately betray me on camera.

43
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,240
You shock me!

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,720
I see.

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,120
This is wonderful.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,240
You're fighting. It's cute.

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,920
It's going to be a collection of
photographs. Look, this one too.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,160
Hand power.

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
Hand power. Thanks.

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,120
I can't even button one.

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Help.

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
1,950 kilometres away from Tokyo.

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Madam Dewi and Degawa's trip...

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,840
Degawa travel guidebook
in Yaeyama Islands.

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,320
We are here

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
in Ishigaki!

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Wonderful!

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Ishigaki Islands, the entrance
to the Yaeyama Islands.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Their trip starts on the westernmost
tip of Ishigaki Island,

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,080
Uganzaki, with its beautiful
white lighthouse and cliffs.

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,200
What is this place?
Is it known for suicides?

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,360
No!

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,320
Stop it! That's horrible.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
Shut up!

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
"Ha ha ha"

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,320
- She's laughing.
- It's a splendid view here.

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,840
Yes, it is magnificent.

68
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,640
I really want to show it,
but you stand out more.

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,800
Madam,

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,160
you sure don't disappoint me.

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
You're fluttering away again today.

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm fluttering. Yes, I am.

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
I mean...

74
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,960
This time, Degawa will take
pictures in Yaeyama Islands

75
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,880
for the calendar.

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
That's amazing.

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,840
In addition, he'll challenge
using the selfie stick.

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,520
What is this? It says SOS.

79
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,520
Emergency SOS? What is that?

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
How do you press the shutter?

81
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,920
This? Two minutes later?
One minute later?

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,080
Now, let's go get a picture
for the calendar!

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
First up is Degawa's recommendation,

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,200
a miraculous beach where a boat
seems to float in the air.

85
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
It can only be seen in water
that's highly transparent.

86
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,960
We actually went searching
for similar scenery...

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,200
We have to walk for 15 minutes?

88
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,360
How about we go, "Wow, beautiful!"
and pretend like we saw it.

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,320
"Pretend like we saw it"

90
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,120
What is this?

91
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,720
The conditions weren't met,
and they failed.

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
So I thought about it.

93
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,760
If I think about it,

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,840
there's no need to go abroad

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,080
because Japan has such a place!

96
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,640
- Really?
- Yes.

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,560
That place is here, the Kabira Bay.

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,960
We're almost there.

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,840
- First, they'll go to Kabira Bay.
- They're such good friends.

100
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Madam, please take
your eye mask off.

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,760
Ah! I see.

102
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,480
- It's wonderful.
- It's beautiful.

103
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,320
One of the magnificent views
of Ishigaki Island, Kabira Bay.

104
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,400
Michelin for travel rated this place
three stars.

105
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,720
It's a place you'd want to visit
at least once.

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,400
- It's beautiful.
- Isn't it really beautiful?

107
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,400
I like the islands too.

108
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,640
- I think we can be hopeful here.
- I agree.

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
Captain, you know how they have
a boat in the air

110
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,840
on a postcard and stuff?

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920
I would appreciate it if you
could take us to that spot.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,440
Right, the sunlight
has to reflect on the sand

113
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,600
to create a shadow for it
to look like the boat is in the air.

114
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
The sandy spots are desirable.

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,640
If we stop around there, it won't
look like the boat is in the air?

116
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
How about here?

117
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,600
- I see.
- I think it's good.

118
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,120
Captain, I think it's good.

119
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,120
- Stop! Stop!
- Drone can stop too.

120
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,160
Yes.

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
The staff will film them from afar.

122
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,760
Were they successful in taking
a picture of a floating boat?

123
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,200
Ah, but it's pretty.

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
It's beautiful.
It's really beautiful.

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,560
Madam, I can't see anything at all.

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,280
Ah! That's wonderful.

127
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Yes, it's great. Stop it.

128
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320
This one. This one is great!

129
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,440
Degawa travel guidebook.
Next, a meal.

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,720
It's a steakhouse
that may be the best in Japan.

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
Oh, you exaggerate everything.

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,960
- No! No!
- Best in Japan? Please!

133
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
Those who know, know,
but those who don't, don't know.

134
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,960
That is usually the case.

135
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,400
That restaurant is located on
the eighth floor of this building.

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,760
Steak &amp; Restaurant PAPOiYA.

137
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,280
Chef Ozawa is the owner chef.

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,840
- I'll have my usual.
- Your usual?

139
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,080
Which one is your usual one?

140
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
It's filet steak.

141
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,960
Just trust me on this one.

142
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,840
I want you to trust me.

143
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Then I'll have that too.

144
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,560
Wonderful. You're very compliant.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,400
This is the filet steak
of Ishigaki beef

146
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,200
that Degawa says
is the best in Japan.

147
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,800
They'll have it medium rare
with beautiful red meat.

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
- That looks delicious.
- Please enjoy your first bite

149
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
without anything.

150
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,360
Please add some salt
for your second bite.

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
After that, please enjoy it
whatever way you like.

152
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,560
Madam has enjoyed delicious steaks
all over the world.

153
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
What is her opinion?

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
It's delicious.

155
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm glad.

156
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,280
Her face is beaming with a smile.

157
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,320
She never reads between the lines.

158
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,040
You know, she's this...

159
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,640
She'll say whatever
she wants to say.

160
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,320
I'm so glad. That smile is sincere.

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
She can't fake her smile.

162
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,160
Seriously.

163
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Since they're here,
I think I'll try these sauces.

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,560
Please.

165
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
How does it taste with sauce?

166
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Oh...

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
I guess she doesn't need the sauce.

168
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Exactly.

169
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Degawa travel guidebook,
tonight's lodging is...

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
here.

171
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,360
This traditional, old-fashioned
Okinawan house with a red roof

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,320
has been converted into an inn.
It's a villa.

173
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,200
- This is great.
- That's cute.

174
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,960
Living and dining rooms are right
there after you enter the house,

175
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,360
and on both sides
are two Japanese rooms.

176
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,760
You take one,
and I'll take the other.

177
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,160
Huh?

178
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,400
What? What's wrong, Madam?

179
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
She's not saying anything.

180
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
And when she sees the bathroom...

181
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
There's a tub that's there.

182
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,760
What? the tub is just there?

183
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,160
You can stay here.

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm going to a hotel.

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
Madam, we are both staying here.

186
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Emergency meeting!

187
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,720
I got this place for you to get
the full Ishigaki Island experience,

188
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,640
with this typical
Ishigaki-style inn.

189
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,760
No, thank you.

190
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,280
The exterior is great.
It seems clean, and it's very nice.

191
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,440
I think this place is great

192
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,440
- for students to come in a group.
- Right, I agree.

193
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,400
Madam, do you really prefer
to stay at a hotel?

194
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Really seriously.

195
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,480
On the second day, they leave
Ishigaki Island for Taketomi Island.

196
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,960
It's six kilometres away
and 10 minutes on a ferry.

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,800
While they wait for departure,
they'll go to Degawa's usual spot.

198
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Degawa's travel guide style
is to eat something sweet here.

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
It's delicious.
It's really delicious.

200
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,720
- Thank you very much.
- Then...

201
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,360
This is cute too.

202
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, no! She'll take it.

203
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
She'll take it?

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,600
Could you sell it to me
for 1,000 yen?

205
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,880
Dewi's travel guide style is to buy
whatever she likes immediately.

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,040
- Madam, really?
- Yes.

207
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,040
- No, that's fine.
- No, no.

208
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
- No, no, you better take it.
- It's fine.

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
For sure.

210
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,760
It actually costs 3,000 yen,
you know.

211
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
Honestly.

212
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh, should I give you more?
Should I give you 2,000 yen?

213
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,920
No, it's fine.

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
Then they finally head over
to the ferry station.

215
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,600
- What is that a statue of?
- Cute.

216
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,320
Ah, I'm impressed that you noticed.

217
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,640
Former WBA light flyweight champion,

218
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,120
a living legend of Ishigaki Island,
the statue of Yoko Gushiken.

219
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,920
They get a picture for memories too.

220
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,600
Ah! That fighting pose is great.

221
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,760
You're fighting! That's cute.

222
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,680
It's cute.

223
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,000
- That's great.
- She's cute.

224
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,840
I don't know why, but it seems
like a really good calendar.

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,880
That was super good!

226
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,760
And the Taketomi Island
that Degawa adores is this.

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
The circumference of the island
is nine kilometres.

228
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Its population is 350.

229
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,520
However, they get
500,000 tourists annually.

230
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,120
The most common way to enjoy
the island is to rent a bicycle.

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,520
I always go to this bicycle shop

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,880
whenever I come here.

233
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,400
And I call the lady of the shop
my Taketomi mum.

234
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,040
What she always says to me is

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,960
not "Welcome"

236
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,160
but "Welcome home."

237
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
There you go again!

238
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,040
- Isn't that great?
- Are you serious?

239
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
I can't help but come because
I want her to say, "Welcome home."

240
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,120
That bicycle shop
he's talking about is this.

241
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Tomori rent-a-cycle.

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,760
Hello.

243
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
Hello.

244
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
- Hello.
- Hello, excuse me.

245
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,520
Is Mum here?

246
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
She's not here right now.

247
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
She's at home?

248
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,200
- I think so.
- I see.

249
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
- Then I'll go see her at the house.
- Okay.

250
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,480
- What? You know her home?
- Yes.

251
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
Mum's home is five minutes on foot.

252
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,600
This is Mum's home,
with those cute flowers.

253
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Now, will his Taketomi Mum
say, "Welcome home," to him?

254
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Mum.

255
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
- Oh!
- Mum!

256
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,880
"Taketomi Mum, Tami Tomori"

257
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,800
Welcome home.

258
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,440
See? She said, "Welcome home."
Did you hear that, Madam?

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
Welcome home.

260
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
This is Madam Dewi,
my special guest.

261
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,360
I don't know why...
It seems like a different show now.

262
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,880
Madam here is 80 years old.

263
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm the same age!

264
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,560
Then I'll get a picture
of Mum and Madam together.

265
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,560
- We will keep our distance.
- You keep your distance.

266
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,760
It's no longer "The Quest"
but "Kazoku ni Kanpai."

267
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,040
"Kazoku ni Kanpai (NHK)"

268
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Madam, you learned how to ride
a bike on The Quest before.

269
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
Right. I forgot it already.

270
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
- What?
- To get on it at first is...

271
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,680
- I need you to hold it.
- Please be careful.

272
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
Okay, I'll hold it.

273
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,600
Now, will the Madam remember
how to ride a bike?

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
Oh, no!

275
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,840
I'm going to let go now.

276
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,200
- Okay, let go.
- Yes.

277
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,240
Good job!

278
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
All right!
I'm going to chase her now!

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
I'm going straight.

280
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,160
Madam can't stop,
so she's going to keep on going.

281
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
"Ha ha ha"

282
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,080
She can't stop once she gets going.
That's her life.

283
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,120
Excuse me, did you see Madam Dewi?

284
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
She went that way?

285
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Thank you!

286
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
There she is!

287
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,920
- Madam!
- Degawa finally caught up with her.

288
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,440
One word?

289
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
TV.

290
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,000
Then...

291
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,760
Madam, I see something.

292
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
I prefer that over a bike.

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
- Let's go on that.
- Buffalo.

294
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,280
So now they ride
on a buffalo carriage.

295
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,640
This is pretty too.

296
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,520
They search for scenery
suitable for a calendar.

297
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
- This is pretty.
- This is pretty.

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,920
Those flowers...

299
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,960
Mizutani, what do I do?
Those flowers

300
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,080
are hard to take...

301
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
How do I focus on Madam?

302
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,400
You just touch it a little.

303
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,960
As long as you see a yellow square.

304
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
You totally suck.

305
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,680
Now, here's a collection of photos
taken on Taketomi Island.

306
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,880
First, Madam tries Yaeyama Soba,
a recommendation by Degawa,

307
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,640
for the first time.

308
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,040
How do you like it?

309
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,320
The whole family is watching you.

310
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
It's delicious. It's very light.

311
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
- The soup is very nice.
- Yes, it is.

312
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,120
A man is watching Madam Dewi eat.

313
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,400
"What is she going to say?"

314
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,000
He looks concerned.

315
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,160
A fresh pineapple juice that Degawa
says is the best in the world.

316
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
That looks delicious.

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
That's great.

318
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,200
Isn't it delicious?

319
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,640
It's delicious. I'll compliment you.

320
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Shall we get the shot
of you drinking it?

321
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,720
This is definitely not
calendar material.

322
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,280
Look at this old man and old lady,

323
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,280
drinking pineapple juice.
Who would want a calendar like that?

324
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,720
And boarding
at Taketomi Island is...

325
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,680
This is it.

326
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,640
- I see.
- Hello.

327
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
I've been expecting you.

328
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,400
Hoshinoya Taketomi Island.

329
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,960
It's a high-end resort
with a traditional-style settlement

330
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,840
in a lot that's
approximately 20,000 tsubo in size.

331
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,200
Mr Degawa, welcome home.

332
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, it's so touching.

333
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,880
Stop lying!
You're making her say it!

334
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,840
No, I'm not making her say it!

335
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,800
I think "Welcome back" is good.

336
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,160
"Welcome home" is a bit...

337
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,600
That's what's heart-warming
about it.

338
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,760
The room they'll stay in is a villa
with traditional architecture.

339
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,520
It costs 11,000 yen per night.

340
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,160
- The bathroom...
- Isn't this bathroom cute?

341
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
It's cute.

342
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
They get lots of couples here?

343
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,800
- They were all couples.
- You're right.

344
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,640
We are like a couple too.

345
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,840
Lovebirds?

346
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,560
And the last calendar photograph
they aim for in Taketomi Island is

347
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,440
a sunset on the west pier.

348
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,240
A great view of Iriomote Island
can be seen from the pier.

349
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,840
It's an Instagenic spot
of Taketomi Island.

350
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,320
I've been to Taketomi a lot,

351
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,360
but I haven't seen the sunset
on the west pier.

352
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,240
- I see.
- So I wanted to go as well.

353
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
But, you know, sunsets

354
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,160
happen every day.
They happen 365 times

355
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,280
on 365 days a year. You can see
the sunset all over the world.

356
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,280
It's nothing rare.

357
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
That?

358
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,560
I'm shocked. I thought you
would say it has 365 colours,

359
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,600
365 faces. I thought it was going
to be a good story,

360
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,280
but, surprisingly,
it was the opposite.

361
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,080
- Ah, but it's great.
- It's great.

362
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,320
It's nice.

363
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,720
Ah! It's like a mirror.
It's very still.

364
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,720
This is magnificent.

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,920
Madam,

366
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,520
we might not belong here.

367
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,520
You're right.

368
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
It's full of couples!

369
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,200
Why don't you two become a couple?

370
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
I see.

371
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
That was a wonderful idea just now.

372
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,480
So...

373
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,320
They take a picture
with the feel of a couple.

374
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,520
It's wonderful.

375
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,720
- See?
- It's pretty.

376
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,920
I went too far.

377
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
What is this?

378
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,160
I only touched it a bit,
and it went off.

379
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,640
I know.

380
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,440
Convenience is an inconvenience.

381
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,520
They took pictures
with different poses

382
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,000
until the sun set completely.

383
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,720
This is great.

384
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,800
- Oh, this one is pretty too.
- It's pretty.

385
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,000
This is cool.

386
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
This is no joke, Madam.

387
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
It's going to be a photo collection.

388
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,680
How about we use our pictures
for all 12 months?

389
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,040
- Good work.
- To Taketomi's night.

390
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,720
- Magnificent dinner.
- What is this?

391
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,240
Hot pot with Ishigaki beef, pork,

392
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,560
and seasonal vegetables,
Shabushabu style.

393
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,000
Their speciality is this vegetable,
Peucedanum.

394
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,400
When you eat a bunch,
your life extends by a day.

395
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,480
- There.
- However...

396
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,000
Longevity, there.

397
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,640
Some meat too.

398
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,920
Meat over greens!

399
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
You go ahead and have some pork.

400
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
There she goes again.

401
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,400
I really do question your human
nature when you say stuff like that.

402
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,440
- I gave you plenty of meat.
- You have.

403
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,160
I just got a little bit. One-third.

404
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
- It's not just a little bit.
- I gave you two-thirds.

405
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
- I gave you two-thirds.
- I gave you meat too.

406
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,840
She's 80 years old,
but she still argues over meat.

407
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,520
That's the best secret
behind longevity.

408
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I think so too.

409
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,120
To finish the trip,
they head to Kohama Island,

410
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,960
the belly button of Yaeyama Islands.

411
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,120
The photograph they aim for is...

412
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,680
We'll go to phantom island.

413
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,080
- Phantom island?
- Yes.

414
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,680
Those who know, know this island,
and those who don't, don't.

415
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,400
You say it like you've seen it,
but it's your first time too, right?

416
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,600
Yes, it is.

417
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,200
It's about 30 minutes by boat
to the island.

418
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,120
Captain, are you a little worried
about the weather?

419
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,960
Yes, it looks like it's going
to rain today. So it's hard.

420
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Say we go there,

421
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,760
but what if it's a boring island?
What are you going to do about it?

422
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,800
If you aren't pleased with it,
then please scold me.

423
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,160
And the moment the camera
stops rolling, I'll scold the staff.

424
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,000
Just like the captain said, both
the weather and the sea are rough.

425
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,320
And Madam starts to lose her temper.

426
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Oh, no!

427
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,920
Look at those waves!

428
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,360
Did you location-hunt properly
beforehand?

429
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,680
Did you take a boat like this?

430
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,280
And 10 minutes later...

431
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,120
It could be seen towards
the right side.

432
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,920
We see it now, Madam!

433
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,000
Which one?

434
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
Is it that white place?

435
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,320
That's not an island.

436
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,600
It's not an island?

437
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh, no. Oh, no.

438
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,200
This?

439
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,920
Are you ridiculing me?

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,640
Your calendar is the main thing,
right?

441
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,240
If you would stand there...

442
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,120
and we take a picture of you
from afar, I think it'll be great.

443
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,560
- Like she's standing in the sea.
- I mean...

444
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,200
What?

445
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,440
However, Madam seems hesitant,
but something changes her mind.

446
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,800
It was the mermaid costume.
We were so certain she'd scold us.

447
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,440
- Mermaid?
- I think you'd be a great mermaid.

448
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,040
Oh, how pretty.

449
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,600
If I put on this costume, it might
make the photograph interesting.

450
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,240
She is able to do anything
for a laugh.

451
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
That's what's magnificent
about Madam.

452
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,760
Amazing!

453
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,520
The staff leaves the two of them
on the island and backs off.

454
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,680
Then...

455
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,760
miraculously, the sun shows up!

456
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,080
"Miracle"

457
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,400
Please take a look.
This truly is the phantom island.

458
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,600
Also known as South Barasu Island.

459
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,840
Coral pieces were gathered
by the current

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
to create this island.

461
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,480
Wow! It's beautiful!
The sun came out!

462
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,360
Yes! Miracles do happen!

463
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,480
Dewi and Tetsuro
make miracles happen!

464
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,320
- The island is getting smaller.
- It really is.

465
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,720
That's fast.

466
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,280
We take a calendar picture before
they become seaweed themselves.

467
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
- Pretty!
- This is nice.

468
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,200
This is the calendar shot!

469
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
Help!

470
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
This island is soon gone!

471
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,520
Rescue me first.

472
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,480
Degawa travel guidebook.

473
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,800
Calendar project is a success!

474
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,280
Madam and Tetsuro, great work!

475
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,400
That was wonderful.

476
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
There's something wrong
with this director.

477
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,120
He barges in
while I'm taking a bath.

478
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,960
It was total chaos,

479
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,600
but those scenes weren't there.

480
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,040
- Director!
- Again!

481
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,040
He's done it again.

482
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,280
I think that was edited out
because her chest was exposed

483
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,800
when she went,
"Cut it out, Tetsuro!"

484
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,080
They were exposed?

485
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,520
You just put those round things
on there.

486
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,920
- Those round things?
- Does that work?

487
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,240
Coming up next,
Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

488
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,800
Yeah!

489
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,120
Nakaoka, where did you go this time?

490
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,840
I went to Kumamoto,
where you are from.

491
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,480
Previously, you took back my title
as the first-class comedian.

492
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,640
He tried to be cool.

493
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,960
Because I tried
to act a little cool.

494
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,320
He was trying to act cool in front
of those female volleyball players.

495
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,960
He was trying to act cool.

496
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,160
- Your status was stripped.
- Right.

497
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,720
So this time, I'm going to try
to get that status back.

498
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I did my best.

499
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,560
Then I'm going to watch
with my eyes wide open.

500
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Okay!

501
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,040
The world has several YouTubers
that film and upload funny videos.

502
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
With this project,
we go on location with them

503
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,280
and aim to make a video that makes
the whole world laugh.

504
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,880
It's called...

505
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,760
QTube.

506
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,440
Hello! Lotti Nakaoka here!

507
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm here in Aso, Kumamoto,
right now.

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,520
Now, can you guess what I'm doing
right now?

509
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,480
- What is with this angle?
- He's walking.

510
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,480
"Promoting Kumamoto's sights"

511
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
Is he on Mount Aso?

512
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,840
- He's walking the summit.
- The correct answer is...

513
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,640
I'm enjoying
a Japanese plume grass maze.

514
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,040
Aso's somma is the number one site
for Japanese plume grass.

515
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,120
Japanese plume grass maze

516
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
is a seasonal feature of autumn.

517
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,920
First, he'll use this maze
for a challenge.

518
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,880
There's a B course that's 150 m
long. Can you finish it in a minute?

519
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,560
150 m in a minute is a sure thing.

520
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,720
By the way, if you can't reach
the goal in a minute,

521
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,600
this will be flying
out of your back.

522
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,800
That's scary. What is that?

523
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,320
What is this?
It's a PET bottle. It's hot.

524
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,920
It's hot.

525
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,360
It's a backpack-style super-hot
PET bottle rocket.

526
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,280
I honestly don't want
this hot water on me,

527
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,920
but then again, I sense the passion

528
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,240
of the staff...

529
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,120
- who made this.
- It is a nice feeling.

530
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,760
Nakaoka's super-hot PET
bottle rocket. What will happen?

531
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
This is scary.

532
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,320
The rocket will be launched by
the staff who will run behind him.

533
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,480
If you go too far from me,
the rocket may launch from tension.

534
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,280
So make sure to keep
within two metres of me.

535
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,480
Can't you control that part?

536
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,160
- That would be irritating.
- Start!

537
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,040
Oh, boy... Go for it.

538
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,840
This is so annoying.

539
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, the path is split.

540
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,120
Which way? Oh, no! I don't know.

541
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh, no! A dead end.

542
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,280
- It's a dead end!
- Oh, no!

543
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,520
30 more seconds left,
but an incident happens.

544
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,840
- What happened?
- Which way?

545
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,440
This way?

546
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
It's hot!

547
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,160
The staff couldn't keep up with
Nakaoka, who suddenly turned,

548
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,040
and the rocket misfired!

549
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,200
It's hot!

550
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm sorry. That was a misfire.

551
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,080
Don't misfire!

552
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,440
It's because you're holding
a camera as well.

553
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,280
Have someone else launch the rocket.

554
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,720
He's super annoyed. That's great.

555
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
Second attempt.

556
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,280
Ready, start!

557
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
- This way!
- Go for it!

558
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,120
It's hot! You idiot!

559
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,160
It's hot!

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,640
- Third attempt.
- Start!

561
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,640
Okay!

562
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
It's hot!

563
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,680
How many times
are you going to do this?

564
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,720
There's a limit
to trial and error, you know!

565
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,320
That is when...

566
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,160
Nakaoka, stop!
There's a bee on your back.

567
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,640
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

568
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,960
Get rid of it!

569
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,520
It's better not to move.

570
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,600
It left. It left.

571
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,080
Let's run!

572
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,320
Bees will chase you
once they select you as a target.

573
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,520
What is this?

574
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,800
What is this?

575
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,920
What is this?

576
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm done with this!

577
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,960
What?

578
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,000
You have lots of hot water ready.

579
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,960
How much were you planning to do?

580
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,520
Next up is a silly video.

581
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,040
Nakaoka ripping tight shirt.

582
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
When he first started QTube,
he was thinner.

583
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,720
Let's use his costume
from back then!

584
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,720
- He was thinner!
- Totally different.

585
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,600
I don't really want to come out.

586
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,800
- What?
- How much weight did he gain?

587
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,840
- Oh?
- It's super tight.

588
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,880
Oh, that doesn't look good.

589
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm seriously depressed here.

590
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
Oh, my...

591
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
I can't even button one.

592
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,760
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

593
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
- Ready...
- Okay.

594
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,000
Go!

595
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,720
Oh! I did it!

596
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,240
Instant.

597
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
- I did it.
- That's incredible.

598
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,160
- He's laughing.
- This is actually sad.

599
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,800
Nakaoka is depressed...

600
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,240
- It's heartbreaking.
- He's gained 15 kg

601
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,960
in the past eight years.

602
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,880
"Currently weighs 80 kilogrammes"

603
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,400
I see.

604
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,280
- He's completely different.
- Time is...

605
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,680
very cruel.

606
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,480
Stop it!

607
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,920
Next, a collaboration
with Kumamoto's super kid!

608
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
- Oh?
- That looks great.

609
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,320
- I don't need that footage.
- I see.

610
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
- I'm Hinata Uchida.
- She's cute.

611
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,840
This is Hinata Uchida, and she's 11.

612
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,520
She's good at
long skateboard dancing.

613
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,800
Dancing?

614
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,040
That's incredible.

615
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,600
They dance to music
on a skateboard,

616
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,360
and they compete on composition
and difficulty of skills.

617
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,160
That's amazing.

618
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
Amazing.

619
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,560
Hinata is the overall
female champion of Japan.

620
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,720
Hinata, I'm ready.

621
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,720
Okay...

622
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,640
- What?
- Well, it's just...

623
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,240
It's perfect.

624
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,160
She chose her words.

625
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,960
It is extremely hard to balance
while dancing on the board

626
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,560
when you actually try it.

627
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,080
I'm sure this is super hard.

628
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,160
- Ouch!
- Oh, that hurts.

629
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,960
He's put on every possible piece
of protective gear, but...

630
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,520
Oh, I didn't have
this one on correctly.

631
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,880
Ouch...

632
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,520
Now, please take a look at him
after five hours of practice.

633
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,560
Oh?

634
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
He has great speed!

635
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,440
Woo-hoo!

636
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,680
First is switch step, where you
switch the front and back feet

637
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,800
and change the direction
of the body.

638
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,320
- She's good.
- That is cool.

639
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,560
How is it?

640
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Ah...

641
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,760
It's awkward,
but he manages to do it.

642
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
He did it.

643
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,040
Next, feet are crossed over quickly
to do this step.

644
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,240
She's really good.

645
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,600
All right! Okay!

646
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,280
- How about this one?
- Oh?

647
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,480
Go!

648
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,800
Yes!

649
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
These are the only skills
he managed to do.

650
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
Now, please watch Hinata's
magnificent skills.

651
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
Thank you very much.

652
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,240
That is so cool.

653
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,280
- That is so cool.
- What is this?

654
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
What is this?

655
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
What was your dream again?

656
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
A patisserie.

657
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,640
A patisserie.

658
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,480
- Isn't this her dream?
- It's surprising, right?

659
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,960
Don't you want to be
in the Olympics?

660
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,800
No, the Olympics are a bit scary.

661
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,840
Why?

662
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
There will be lots of people there.

663
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,680
- You don't like to be in public?
- No.

664
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,800
Why don't you ask the star for
advice on not getting nervous?

665
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,960
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

666
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,320
You get used to it.

667
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,480
She's laughing.

668
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,120
Next, the super kids of the world.

669
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,000
Virtual QTube with Dandan in China.

670
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,720
He balances on the board
placed on a cylinder,

671
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,600
and he stacks a plate
on top of his head.

672
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,840
No way.

673
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,960
- No way!
- This is incredible.

674
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,920
This is no joke.

675
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
From your outfit
and from what you do,

676
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,800
I think you're part of
an acrobatics group.

677
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,440
Yes, I am.

678
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,680
Of course he is. Of course.

679
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,160
It's a success for Nakaoka
if he stacks two plates.

680
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,120
First, he'll balance and stabilise
on the board.

681
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,080
Wait. Wait.

682
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,680
This part is fixed.

683
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,160
- I see.
- Let's do this.

684
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,080
I'm going for it.

685
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Ouch.

686
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,480
- That would hurt.
- That hurts.

687
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,800
This is super hard.

688
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,600
He is not even close
after two hours.

689
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,520
"One hour later"

690
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,080
"Two hours later"

691
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,920
Ouch!

692
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Then Dandan, who's been
watching him, has a tip.

693
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,520
- Dandan has advice for you.
- Yes.

694
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,160
The bowl you put on the board
should be facing down.

695
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,960
- Like so?
- Yes.

696
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,360
That's how it's done?

697
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,240
You should have said that sooner.

698
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,760
But with this advice,
the bowl's projection is consistent.

699
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,640
I need to watch it.

700
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,160
Here's his 156th challenge.

701
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
That's amazing.

702
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,360
- Is it good?
- I think he did it.

703
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,040
- That's great!
- It's looking good. There you go!

704
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,840
Wow!

705
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,280
Nakaoka was successful!

706
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
Yes! Yes!

707
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,320
What did you think?

708
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,760
"Lotti Nakaoka's
QTube in Kumamoto"

709
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,800
Practise some more.

710
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,040
Why?

711
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,000
He's strict.

712
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,040
Next is an amazing technique video
from Kumamoto.

713
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,360
It was submitted by Jun Noda, ranked
second in vaulting box in Japan.

714
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,960
This is the trick.

715
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,040
When you play this in reverse...

716
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,160
"Playing in reverse"

717
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,360
Let's have Nakaoka do
this reverse jumping too!

718
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,040
Here!

719
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,040
Go for it!

720
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,920
First, he'll do
a regular forward jump.

721
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,640
He barely manages
to do a forward jump.

722
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,440
Now, can he go in reverse?

723
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,720
- Go!
- Go for it!

724
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,560
This is super hard.

725
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,840
Nakaoka's jumping ability
is hopeless.

726
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,960
We have one
for elementary school kids.

727
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
- You do?
- Yes.

728
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,200
What will you do?
Will you jump the big one,

729
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,360
or will you eat your pride
and use a small one?

730
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,920
Right. If I choose this immediately,

731
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,240
I feel as though
I'm lowering my standards,

732
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,600
and I hate that.

733
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,120
Even if I use this,
if I manage to float on here,

734
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,120
I don't think people will notice
the difference in size.

735
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,600
"Suggests to switch"

736
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,880
So let's not say anything
and pick this one.

737
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,400
- We won't show them we switched it?
- Nope.

738
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
They won't know.

739
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,760
They're so similar.

740
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,240
- Here I go.
- What a nasty professional.

741
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,280
It's obviously smaller.

742
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,440
Oh?

743
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,280
Nope.

744
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,440
Cute.

745
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,880
Next is a popular challenge video.

746
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,240
CDs are placed between
four stacked bottles.

747
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,840
A CD is removed by a roundhouse kick
without knocking over the bottles.

748
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,480
He'll try to remove two CDs.

749
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
I see.

750
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh?

751
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,760
- Where is this?
- It's someone's yard...

752
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,960
So cute.

753
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,960
Hello.

754
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,320
Thank you.

755
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,560
Hand power.

756
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
- Hand power.
- So cute!

757
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,400
Nakaoka's roundhouse kick,
removing CDs.

758
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,560
So cute.

759
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
It's hard to judge the distance
of a roundhouse kick,

760
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,880
and only half of a CD
is available to be kicked.

761
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,080
Gurenge.

762
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,600
Will he succeed in one kick?

763
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,480
Yes!

764
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,200
Miraculous kick on the lower stack.

765
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,040
- Yes!
- It didn't move at all.

766
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Wasn't that amazing?
It's not even shaking.

767
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,760
I'll get this one next.

768
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,680
Next, the upper level.

769
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,000
However...

770
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,240
Ah, darn it.

771
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,920
That was close.

772
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,520
He was off to a good start,

773
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,280
but what was unexpected was...

774
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,320
What?

775
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,000
that the set-up
takes a very long time.

776
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,920
It's tilted this way.

777
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,040
- It's dark already.
- It's dark.

778
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,280
It is.

779
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,640
It got dark while they were trying
to stack it up straight.

780
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,480
I'll get it in one shot.

781
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
Okay.

782
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,960
It's getting late,
so this is his last chance.

783
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,760
- Okay.
- Will he succeed?

784
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,560
Here I go.

785
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,120
Ha!

786
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,200
Ouch.

787
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,560
A heavy blow to his heel.

788
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,600
Ouch!

789
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,760
That hurt.

790
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,840
It seriously hurts.

791
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,480
He sure is a first-class comedian.

792
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,280
Finally, he'll challenge doing
an impressive Olympic skill.

793
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,520
Finally, he'll challenge doing
an impressive Olympic skill.

794
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,160
They came to Aqua Dome Kumamoto.

795
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
He will be assisted by...

796
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
Are you my instructor?

797
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,200
I'm the mysterious masked
water polo player.

798
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,120
I'm Maskman W.

799
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,640
What's with this get-up?

800
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,480
His work doesn't know about this.
It's cumbersome to hide his face,

801
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,400
but he's an amazing player
who once represented Japan.

802
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,280
He'll challenge doing a skip shot.

803
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,520
This is the shot.

804
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,720
Wow, that's amazing.

805
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,680
He jumps high in a deep pool.

806
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,400
The ball is bounced once off
the water's surface to make a goal.

807
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,200
Nakaoka is to master this

808
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,640
and hit the target above the goal
to call it a success.

809
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,600
Oh? Is that Kumamon?

810
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,280
What do we practise first?

811
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
We'll practise egg beater kicks.

812
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,080
- Egg beater kicks?
- Treading water.

813
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,360
Water polo is played in a deep pool
where the feet won't reach.

814
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,800
So unless you can tread in water,
it can't be done.

815
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,160
How many seconds can I go on for?

816
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,880
Here I go.

817
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,920
Nakaoka once did
synchronised swimming on QTube.

818
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,200
How is his skill?

819
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
This looks gross.

820
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,040
Instructor...

821
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,120
help me...

822
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,400
Help!

823
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,320
He is at his limits in a minute.

824
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,600
Help me!

825
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
No! This is no joke. Help.

826
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,080
However, the Maskman
corners Nakaoka.

827
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,040
Maskman!

828
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
Instructor! The board!

829
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,600
What did you do that for?

830
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,880
Seriously!

831
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,360
- Oh, no!
- Seriously.

832
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,600
You guys better quit it!

833
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,280
You know, this instructor...

834
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
when I tried to reach for this,

835
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
he flipped it like that.

836
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
So then I thought I would go here,

837
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,080
and when I tried to approach it,

838
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,800
he pulled my hand.

839
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,800
You know, instructor...

840
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,840
I can't do this
unless he apologises to me for it.

841
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,600
I want you to push your limits.

842
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,520
Huh?

843
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Unless you go beyond your limits,

844
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,640
you won't be able to do it.

845
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,600
Then the Maskman gives a present
to Nakaoka to get him hyped up.

846
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,840
Mysterious water polo player
Maskman N!

847
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,560
Maskman W.

848
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
The two of us are

849
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,800
water polo brothers!

850
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,160
Maskman N!

851
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,600
He tries to tread water again.

852
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,120
Can you breathe like that?

853
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,760
Wait!

854
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
Wait.

855
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,120
It's really hard to do with this.

856
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,040
It's really hard to do this.

857
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,360
His mask doesn't have
the bottom part.

858
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,800
My hole is this small.

859
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,680
The water comes right in.

860
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160
And the water that came in

861
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,080
comes right into my mouth
without exception.

862
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,040
Next, he'll practise
shooting the ball.

863
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,520
Let's do this.

864
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,960
He'll first use a flotation ring
to get the hang of it.

865
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,920
- Here I go!
- Then...

866
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,360
It doesn't have much height,
but he is successful in bouncing it.

867
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
I can do it.

868
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,000
On the other hand,
Maskman's power is...

869
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,400
- Okay!
- Here I go!

870
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,560
What? From there?

871
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,320
That's impossible.

872
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,440
He can easily score a goal
from 25 metres away.

873
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,360
If you throw it from here,
then it gets too low,

874
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,680
so if you could release the ball
at a higher point...

875
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,440
Then...

876
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,080
He can do it.

877
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
I hit it!

878
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,560
Yes!

879
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,360
It was a nice shot
that hit the goalpost.

880
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,680
That was good.

881
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,000
Yes!

882
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,840
However, without a flotation ring,
it's a whole nother story.

883
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Here I go!

884
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Not even close.

885
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,160
Not even close.

886
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,000
Seriously?

887
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,040
It's hard to float

888
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,200
in a pool when your feet
can't reach the bottom.

889
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,360
This is no joke.

890
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,800
It's completely different.

891
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,480
Completely different.

892
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,560
Now, a surprise for Nakaoka,
who's feeling down.

893
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,280
He eats bread a lot lately.

894
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,520
Actually...

895
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,320
Kumamon came to cheer him up
as a surprise.

896
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,880
- Is it hard?
- It's hard.

897
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,160
I don't know what kind of bread
this is, but it's super delicious.

898
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,360
It's so good
I don't want to finish it all.

899
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,200
It must be good.

900
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,240
Look back.

901
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,360
- Thank you, but
- Look behind you.

902
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,040
now that I've eaten this...

903
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,640
Wow, you scared me! What?

904
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,520
What? What's going on?

905
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,920
It's Kumamon!

906
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,560
He's been here since you had
half of your doughnut.

907
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,520
What?

908
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,080
Now he'll film a funny video
with Kumamon.

909
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,960
Let's film QTube!

910
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,400
- Woo-hoo!
- Oh! He got me!

911
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,800
Gigantic rubber release jump.

912
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,120
What? He'll do it?

913
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,480
On a count of three, a gigantic
rubber band will be released.

914
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
Can they avoid it by jumping?

915
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,680
Can Kumamon do it?

916
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
Three, two,

917
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,920
then you should jump around 1.5.

918
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,400
Let's do this.

919
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,520
Nakaoka and Kumamon's
rubber band release jump.

920
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
- Ready?
- Yes.

921
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,280
Three,

922
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,400
two,

923
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,400
one.

924
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,440
Go!

925
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,040
Kumamon, you jumped too soon.

926
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,440
- He's already on the ground.
- He jumps quite high.

927
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,200
It hit Kumamon good.

928
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,720
You jumped way too early.

929
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,600
- Thank you very much.
- That's it?

930
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,120
I feel so much better! Thank you!

931
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,080
Thank you!

932
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,120
Thank you.

933
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,080
I'm so glad.

934
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,960
Now, the main event. Will he hit
the Kumamon target with a skip shot?

935
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,200
His first shot.

936
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,720
Okay!

937
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,920
Okay!

938
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,120
It's not good at all.

939
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,200
What Nakaoka lacks is the height
when he throws the ball.

940
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,680
No matter how many times he tries,
he doesn't have the angle

941
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,480
to let the ball bounce.

942
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,280
My physical strength...

943
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,360
I'm sorry... I need a break.

944
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
He's physically exhausted.

945
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,560
Then...

946
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,720
Maskman, do you have a ball
that bounces more?

947
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,880
I do,

948
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,840
but it won't be
a ball for water polo.

949
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,360
It'll be a ball
for playing dodgeball.

950
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,720
Dodgeball...

951
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,920
I see.

952
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,440
You can't tell.

953
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,640
There he goes again!
It's his second time.

954
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,800
How would you explain it?

955
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
Oh, we won't explain it.

956
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
"We won't explain it"

957
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,480
It's fine.

958
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,320
- Do you want to try and see?
- Yes, let's try it.

959
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,480
Please be happy if I hit it.

960
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,320
- You got it.
- This is incredible too.

961
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,840
- Here I go!
- He threw a dodgeball...

962
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Go!

963
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,760
- Wow!
- Yes!

964
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,680
Yes!

965
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,680
There it is!

966
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,560
- That's incredible, right?
- It is.

967
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,800
Yes!

968
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,280
That was hard.

969
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,360
Oh?

970
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,200
He doesn't seem pleased.

971
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,920
How is that?
Is that considered okay?

972
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,800
Don't you still have some more time?

973
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,120
About 15 minutes.

974
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,280
- I got it.
- It's short.

975
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,880
I'll put everything
into those 15 minutes.

976
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,640
Nakaoka decides to redo it.

977
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,600
I just can't say, "Yes! I did it!"
and mean it.

978
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,720
It was changed.

979
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,160
I just can't say it.

980
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,240
I'm more motivated than ever.

981
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,240
- Are you?
- Yes.

982
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm embarrassed that I did that.

983
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,160
I'm going to make this one.

984
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,560
I'm so ashamed about what I did.

985
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,600
There's not much time left
on location.

986
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,560
Will Nakaoka make the goal?

987
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,600
I'll try to go up higher.

988
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,880
Go!

989
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Oh?

990
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,280
I'm done!

991
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,920
"I'm done"

992
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,040
It's impossible.

993
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,520
Nakaoka, are you serious?

994
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,400
Everything you've done
goes down the drain.

995
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,320
What a horrible look.

996
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,040
I have the right to quit.

997
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,440
That's it for Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

998
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,920
You now, I would say this one
was pathetic.

999
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,880
With the vaulting box
and with the ball...

1000
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,280
He finished with a stuffy nose.
"I have the right to quit."

1001
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,000
Oshima, what did you think?

1002
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,680
I would say it was pathetic too.

1003
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
Right?

1004
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,320
How his eyes get so small when
he has that horrible expression...

1005
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,720
- His eyes get really small.
- They're small.

1006
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,480
- It's annoying, right?
- Those eyes!

1007
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,200
Well, you know, for this part,

1008
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,760
I really want all of you performers
to be on my side.

1009
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,320
Wait! I did it several times!

1010
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,520
You know, that water polo segment

1011
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,320
is short,
but I spent like two whole days.

1012
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,160
I was in the pool the whole time
to practise.

1013
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,360
It's not just a few hours.
I did it for two days.

1014
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,520
My body was all messed up
from the start on the second day.

1015
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,000
But it was edited
like I hadn't done anything.

1016
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,360
- That's editing's fault.
- Are you kidding me?

1017
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,480
But then you guys are saying,
"It was pathetic," too?

1018
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,880
What is the point of me
being here, then?

1019
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,480
No, no. We can't tell
with all that editing.

1020
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,160
We can't tell you were doing it
for two days.

1021
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,120
And that instructor would throw
the floatation ring,

1022
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,480
and when he pulled me back,
I was really at my limits.

1023
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,760
But you shouldn't lose it, though.

1024
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,440
- You're right.
- Right.

1025
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,040
Yes.

1026
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,560
I shouldn't lose it.

1027
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,760
Mentally,
I know I shouldn't lose it,

1028
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,400
but I lost it.

1029
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,320
You guys better quit it!

1030
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,320
- You can't lose it there.
- Nope.

1031
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,520
There, you should be saying,
"Stop it," to them,

1032
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,680
but you thank them in your heart.

1033
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,480
That's the way to do it.

1034
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,600
He's first-class.
This is first-class.

1035
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,600
Right...

1036
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,720
What you've done is third-class.

1037
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,280
"Quit it!" is third-class.

1038
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,080
Darn it!
