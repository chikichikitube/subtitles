1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,200
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,520
Today's first challenge is...

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,720
A man's challenge series.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,200
What is it this time?

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,360
This time,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
it's "marshmallow catch," again.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,640
What?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,080
- Again?
- Once again.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,920
Degawa once managed to catch
a marshmallow at 170km/h,

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
which is the fastest speed
in the world.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,800
In addition, he successfully
caught it from 52m away,

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,280
the longest distance in the world.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,160
Currently, he holds two unofficial
"marshmallow catch" records.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,520
However, when he attempted
to catch it from a 100m drop

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,760
for his third title,

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,200
he failed miserably.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,560
He was unable to become
the triple record holder.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,080
This time, he'll retry it
from that height again.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,000
Quite frankly, it's difficult.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,840
At the end, I had like 10 other
people help me out,

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,720
and even then,
we weren't able to catch it.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,880
However, a powerful corporation
stepped up to assist this challenge.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,400
It's Kashiyama Vacuum Solutions
in Saku, Nagano.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
Yes, it's the company that
manufactures the vacuum pump

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,400
that pitched at a speed
of 271km/h at Imoto last year.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,320
This pump is used to shoot
the marshmallow 100m up in the air.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,240
And this time,

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,840
a new Degawa girl
will be participating.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
What? You mean other than
those three?

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,520
- Yes.
- What's going on?

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,560
We need a breath of fresh air.

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
Do those three know about this?

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,040
No.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,160
- They don't know?
- No.

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,000
- No, no, no. That's a problem.
- That's not good.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
There's going to be trouble
for sure.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,560
I mean those three cause
enough problems on their own.

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,880
Will he succeed this time?

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,600
And who is this new Degawa girl?

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,160
Degawa! Ready!

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,920
"The Quest"

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,640
"This programme was broadcast
24 January, 2021"

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,560
The Quest has started.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
Tonight, it's the man's challenge
by our advisor,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,840
and Asako Ito's Mystery Tour.

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,760
"Ayako Imoto, Daisuke Miyagawa,
Asako Ito, Kazuko Kurosawa"

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,680
"Tomoko Murakami, Miyuki Oshima
Tetsuro Degawa"

48
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,160
This is your fourth time doing
a marshmallow catch.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
I already have two world records,
but I want the third one too.

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,880
In addition,
we have a new Degawa girl.

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,680
- I'm surprised.
- Is it going to be okay?

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Those three don't know anything
about it, right?

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,600
The fact that the three of them
don't know about it is terrifying.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
It is terrifying.

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,240
And Kawakita recently
got married, too.

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,040
- Exactly.
- That's something to celebrate.

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Since she got married,

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,200
"Miss Retired" pops up
everywhere online.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
That's not good.

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,200
- They want a new Degawa girl.
- I don't believe this.

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,000
- You traitor! Traitor!
- No, no.

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,520
Isn't it very intriguing?

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
What is this trick?

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
I shall retire today.

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,000
"Aichi's intriguing mysteries
are thoroughly investigated"

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,480
An hour and a half away from Tokyo
on Hokuriku Shinkansen.

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,080
A man's challenge by the advisor.

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,840
A 100m-drop marshmallow catch
in Saku, Nagano.

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,200
We are here

70
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
in Saku!

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,080
They start off with Degawa
and the usual three girls.

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,480
This is wonderful.

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,040
This is amazing.

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
- It's beautiful.
- It's cute.

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
Now, he will share the news
with the three of them.

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,680
This time,

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
a new Degawa girl is here.

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,920
- There you go again.
- Really?

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,520
You're horrible.
There you go again.

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
- You really are a traitor.
- Wait.

81
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
- You traitor! Traitor!
- No, no!

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,520
The news aroused fierce opposition.

83
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
Let's split this up today.

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
- Right!
- No!

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,320
I was summoned
to Nippon TV the other day,

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,680
and they said they wanted
a breath of fresh air.

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
A breath of fresh air?

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Are you kidding me?

89
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,440
What shocked me the most is that
they auditioned before the pandemic.

90
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,640
What?

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
That's so long ago!

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
That's so long ago.

93
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,800
That's cheating! I feel cheated on!

94
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,920
You're such cheaters!

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,240
We just want a breath of fresh air.

96
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,600
We are fresh.

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,440
The way you said it made them sound
like a rotten tangerine.

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
- Like a rotten tangerine.
- Don't call us rotten tangerine.

99
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,160
I haven't met
the new Degawa girl yet.

100
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,520
- I see.
- Right.

101
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm looking forward to it.

102
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,720
It'd be hard for her to appear
after all this disputing.

103
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,000
- I'm really sorry.
- We can do it together.

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
- I'll call her now.
- Yes.

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,400
Please come in.

106
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,480
How do you do, I'm Yumena Yanai.

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
She's Yumena Yanai, 20 years old.

108
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,040
She's a young actress who also has
the title of a Miss Seventeen.

109
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,360
- Yumena? Oh my, you're cute.
- Nice to meet you.

110
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
You're so excited.

111
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,080
You're too fast.

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
- You're too excited too soon.
- I've never seen you like this.

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm not excited.

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
- You are too.
- He was fast.

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,160
Your smile is too much.

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,720
It's just that she came out with all
this lighting and she's very fresh.

117
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
It's a bit dull over here.

118
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,320
- That's horrible.
- We are not!

119
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,600
I'll be doing this
as a fresh tangerine.

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
- Thank you.
- She said it herself.

121
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
She said it.

122
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,880
Now, a last minute event,
New Degawa girl's interview.

123
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,440
We shall start the interview.

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,720
Please introduce yourself.

125
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm Yumena Yanai, I'm 20 years old.

126
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm from Fukushima
and I live there too.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880
I commute from home
to go to work.

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,680
You commute from Fukushima
for every job?

129
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes, I use Shinkansen.

130
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,880
Then your travel fees might be
more than your guaranteed fee?

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,240
Well, half of my travel fees
is covered by the agency.

132
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,040
What else do you do
besides "Seventeen"?

133
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,960
I work as an actress too.

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
What did you appear in?

135
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,240
"Mr. Hiiragi's Homeroom."

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
- Oh?
- What?

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,000
We haven't had a chance
to talk to each other.

138
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,840
Did you have a role
with lots of lines?

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
My seat was behind Mei Nagano,

140
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
and I had quite a lot of lines.

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,320
Wait one second.

142
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,520
If she had lots of lines,

143
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,840
then that means she had more
lines than Akane?

144
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,280
Please stop.

145
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,600
- It will be too real.
- You weren't supposed to ask that.

146
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,280
We have this
"actress inferiority complex."

147
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,640
It's an inferiority complex?

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,680
We have
this actress inferiority complex.

149
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,280
Is it okay for you to be a Degawa
girl if you're busy with work?

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
I've always wanted to do this.

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,320
It was my dream.

152
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,760
I've never been abroad.
I've never been on a plane either.

153
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,600
I'd like to go abroad
for the first time with The Quest.

154
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Oh, it's not a trip!

155
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
Yume!

156
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,280
Our job is not to make trips
to make memories.

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,720
Make trips to make memories?

158
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Do you have any special skills?

159
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,240
I was in a gymnastics club
for three years in middle school,

160
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,600
so I'm very flexible.

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
I can jump over a vaulting horse.

162
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
I can also do a cartwheel
on a balance beam.

163
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Wow.

164
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,920
I can do a bridge too.
I'll do it right now.

165
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
That's amazing.

166
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,600
Amazing!

167
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,240
- She's flexible.
- There.

168
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
Can you really jump
the vaulting horse?

169
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,160
Then I'll do it.

170
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
- I can do it too.
- There she goes!

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
She can do it too.

172
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,480
There she goes again!

173
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,920
Go! Go!

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Those two won't do it themselves.

175
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,360
Amazing!

176
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm so happy!

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,240
Maria is so Maria
for jumping it here.

178
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,520
She won't support the newbie at all.

179
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Yanai performs a cartwheel
on the balance beam.

180
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,440
Oh! That's a clean one.

181
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
There!

182
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,800
- Wonderful! That's pretty!
- Amazing.

183
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

184
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,120
By the way, you mentioned how it
was your dream to be a Degawa girl,

185
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,440
do you admire a particular
Degawa girl?

186
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,320
Of course it's you, Kawakita.

187
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
She passed!

188
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
She passed!

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
That's not right!

190
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,960
She pressured her with her eyes!

191
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,320
- She passed! I like her!
- She glared her down.

192
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Now, the main event,
the marshmallow catch.

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,960
The event is held at a baseball
field at Saku Sogo Athletics Park.

194
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Kashiyama Vacuum Solution employees
will assist us.

195
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,040
Kashiyama Vacuum Solutions
has the second largest share

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,600
of vacuum pumps in the world.

197
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,160
That machine is used to shoot
marshmallows in the air.

198
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,680
Air is pumped through
the cylinder in a vacuum state,

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,920
to shoot a marshmallow
100m up in the air.

200
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,200
We struggled the most with the wind.

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
We practised to increase accuracy.

202
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,240
However, there's a minor problem.

203
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,280
This is hard.

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,160
Why isn't it soft?

205
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,440
When marshmallows are in a vacuum,
they expand, as shown.

206
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,520
When air is shot through it,
then it then shrinks.

207
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,200
Then wouldn't it hurt
when it comes down?

208
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,480
Which hurts more?
An elastic band hitting you?

209
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,440
It hurts more than when you're hit
with an elastic band.

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,400
That's right. It hurts quite a bit
when it hits your face.

211
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,640
With that in mind,
a marshmallow catch from 100 m.

212
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,520
What's with this tarp?

213
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,160
We expect the marshmallow
to land in this area.

214
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
- Isn't it kind of wide?
- It seems a bit too wide?

215
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Is that my imagination?

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Marshmallows are affected
by the wind,

217
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
so it all depends on their luck
where it lands.

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
- Degawa, get it the first time!
- Okay

219
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
- Have fun!
- Good luck!

220
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I'll be the true marshmallow king!

221
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
Come on!

222
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Three, two, one.

223
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
- You can do it!
- You got it!

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
It's this way!

225
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,040
Ah! That's not it!

226
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,720
That's not a marshmallow.

227
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,560
That was close.

228
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,800
We forgot to mention to Degawa, but
a marshmallow is shot in a cylinder.

229
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,400
The cylinder is heavier,
so it doesn't fly as high.

230
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,000
Go!

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
That's not it!

232
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
On the other hand, a marshmallow
went as high as 100m,

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
but it dropped to the grass area
in the outfield.

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
That's not a marshmallow.

235
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,720
Take a look at this!

236
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,160
This is super hard.

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,360
Man, if this thing hit my face...

238
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm glad I'm slow.

239
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,280
Now, a second try while
watching out for the cylinder.

240
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,960
- Where?
- That's hard.

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
Where is it? Where?

242
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,000
- Where did it go?
- There it is!

243
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,760
I couldn't tell at all!

244
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,760
You can't see it.

245
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,320
- There's no way to see that.
- How do you tell?

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,120
It's not "Oh no! Oh no!" but
I mean it's really is "oh no"!

247
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,200
Bring it!

248
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
Hotta will try it too.

249
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,320
- You can do it!
- Oh no!

250
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,880
It's so high and so fast
that the camera can't see it.

251
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,720
- There!
- No way!

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,600
The marshmallow barely landed
on the blue tarp.

253
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
Akane, did you see it?

254
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,960
Not even a millimetre...

255
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,280
- Right?
- Right.

256
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,840
It's like a shooting star.

257
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,480
The first day ends here,
due to time constraints.

258
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,680
It's already past 10:00.

259
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,720
And that's it
for the three Degawa girls.

260
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,800
Good work.

261
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Good work!

262
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
- Excuse me.
- Good bye.

263
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,640
- Good luck to you!
- Good luck to you.

264
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,040
- We're cheering for you!
- We're cheering for you!

265
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
Wait. Wait. Wait.

266
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Shouldn't you be more frustrated?

267
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,360
You know...

268
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
I just want to go home.

269
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,520
You know...

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,480
this is impossible. Honestly.

271
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,880
Okay, I got it. I'm about
to be discouraged here,

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,560
but what will you do, Yume?

273
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
I will accompany you!

274
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,600
- She's so cute!
- So cute!

275
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,960
That was just so cute!

276
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Good work!

277
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,040
See you!

278
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,200
The admirable trio was brought in
to liven up for the newbie girl,

279
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,360
and they are now sent home.

280
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,560
Second day of challenge.

281
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,680
This challenge will take place over
four days at different ballparks.

282
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Please watch our documentary
of adults running around

283
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,400
to catch a marshmallow,
for four days.

284
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
Take a look at how windy it is.

285
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,520
Today's condition is no joke.

286
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
They start their challenge
in wind at 3m/s.

287
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,600
Degawa, here it comes!

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
- Okay!
- Go for it!

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Three,

290
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
two,

291
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,520
one!

292
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,840
The first shot of the day is...

293
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
- I can't see it! Right side!
- On the right side!

294
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,880
Right. Right. Right.

295
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,480
No! That's the drone.

296
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,280
What is this? Darn it!

297
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
Oh, it's not a drone.

298
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
What is that?

299
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,640
- That's a bird.
- A bird?

300
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,840
Just like last night, he can't spot
the marshmallow at all.

301
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,240
Yume, I don't think you serve any
purpose standing there.

302
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,080
How about you position her here?

303
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,440
Yanai will navigate the location
of the marshmallow.

304
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,520
However...

305
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,160
I don't see it. I don't see it.

306
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,480
I don't see it at all.

307
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
It's to the front.

308
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
- To the front!
- To the front!

309
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,400
Oh, to the right! Right!

310
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,840
Wait one second.

311
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,560
Wait, wait, wait.

312
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
You're no good at all.
You're just like me!

313
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,040
He attempts several times
to catch it,

314
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,600
but Degawa is unable to see
the marshmallow.

315
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,880
It's coming.

316
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,560
- Wow!
- To the left!

317
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,040
For the past few hours,

318
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,560
I've been standing here,

319
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
going left and right

320
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
for something I can't see.

321
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
As you're told...

322
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,800
Right, as I am told. It's just
that I don't see it at all.

323
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll be more motivated
if I have a goal,

324
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,560
but without a goal or anything,

325
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,400
I just stand here doing this for
several hours in this darn cold,

326
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
this whole time.

327
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,280
And to make things worse,
it got very windy.

328
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,480
Since they can't do anything,

329
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,200
they eat the local speciality flan
for an afternoon snack.

330
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,240
- It's delicious.
- Is it delicious?

331
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,640
Yes, now use Fukushima dialect.

332
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Degawa directs, a gourmet report
in Fukushima dialect.

333
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,080
What's this? It's delicious.

334
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,480
This is no joke.

335
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
This is delicious. What is this?

336
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,600
From what I heard last night,

337
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,920
I guess you and your family
had it hard.

338
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,920
You said you could only eat squid
even when you went out for barbecue.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
- Just squid.
- Just squid.

340
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,560
I couldn't eat any meat.

341
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
- What? Do your best.
- We couldn't eat meat.

342
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,680
And the challenge...

343
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,920
is done at night as well.

344
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,640
In the centre! Close to first base!
First base!

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
In the centre!

346
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
- It's easier to see at night.
- In the centre!

347
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
I saw it from around here.

348
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,400
But even if I see it,
I still won't get to it on time.

349
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,880
Then we'll just have to increase
the quantity.

350
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,400
The eight-marshmallow plan.

351
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,920
I see it.

352
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,360
I finally feel like
I'm participating now.

353
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Okay.

354
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
Let's go with this plan.
This is the best idea.

355
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
We see the light now.

356
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,760
However, there was a flaw
to this plan as well.

357
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,360
Third base! Third base!
Oh, but first base too!

358
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,640
He hesitates to pick one.

359
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,080
Yume, which one?

360
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,840
Third day of their challenge.

361
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,960
Starting today, two vacuum pumps
will be used simultaneously

362
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,200
to carry out
a 16-marshmallow plan.

363
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,280
Then a huge chance came their way!

364
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,840
There it is.

365
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
Up!

366
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,960
A marshmallow hit Degawa's chin.

367
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,160
That was close!

368
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,840
That was close!

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,000
Hey! Come on!

370
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
That was so...

371
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,800
You could have caught that one
just now.

372
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,240
I could have caught it.
I could have done it.

373
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
But you know,

374
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,800
I feel alive now.

375
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,680
I mean yesterday, I was like,
"What am I doing?"

376
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,040
However, he's out of luck
after that.

377
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,000
One!

378
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,000
Go!

379
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,720
Catch it!

380
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,600
What are you doing?

381
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,400
I chased after it!

382
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
You should have caught that one!

383
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,120
Yumeppe.

384
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Yumeppe...

385
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,920
- Yumeppe, you--
- Yumeppe.

386
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,560
Yumeppe is cool.

387
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,560
No, it's not cool.

388
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,160
- Don't you think "Yumeppe" is cute?
- Yumeppe?

389
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,000
Her nickname shall be "Yumeppe."

390
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
How about you try it once, Yumeppe.

391
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,880
Then... I'll give it a try.

392
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,920
All right. Are you okay
with Yumeppe?

393
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,360
It sounds like a fart.

394
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,760
It sounds like a silent fart.

395
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,760
Right.

396
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,120
So Yumeppe will try now.

397
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,080
Will she get it done?

398
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,520
No, no, no.

399
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,760
Wait one second.

400
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
I apologise.

401
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,040
Did you get it? That pressure?

402
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,200
They come up to you every time,

403
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,560
and they go "What? What?"
Did you feel that pressure?

404
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,560
I really felt that just now.

405
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,000
Second attempt by Yumeppe.

406
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,800
- Go on.
- Looking good!

407
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,080
Good!

408
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,280
This was so close.

409
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,920
I don't want to say this,
but she could've caught that one.

410
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,520
What are you glaring at me for?

411
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm not glaring at you.

412
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,000
- What are you glaring at me for?
- I'm not glaring at you.

413
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,120
- You're glaring at me.
- No, I'm not glaring at you.

414
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,360
- Come on, get upset.
- No.

415
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,360
I've seen this routine on TV before.

416
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,080
Don't say "routine."

417
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,360
Don't call it a routine! It took
Ryuhei Ueshima and I several years

418
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,280
to create this.

419
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Change! Change!

420
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,920
A good one is coming right now.

421
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,800
Then came
the biggest opportunity of the day!

422
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,200
It wasn't for Degawa, but...

423
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
it was for Yumeppe!

424
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
It's coming. Come on.

425
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,320
Ouch!

426
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,440
A marshmallow strikes
Yumeppe's cheek.

427
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,280
It was three centimetres away
from her mouth.

428
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You saw it coming,
and then it hit your face?

429
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,800
I wasn't ready for it.

430
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,880
It wasn't like, "Come on!"

431
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,840
It was more like,
"Huh? Is it coming this way? Is it?"

432
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,600
Then bam!

433
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,760
They changed positions,
but she's pretty much participating,

434
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,920
so now both of them will attempt
to catch a marshmallow.

435
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
What was that?

436
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,760
That's so annoying!

437
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,520
The trajectory changes!

438
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,280
Marshmallows have bad character.

439
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,360
They are twisted.

440
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,600
They are.

441
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,600
They are no joke.

442
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,120
Their third day on location
was done.

443
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,760
Even that beautiful moon looks
like a marshmallow now.

444
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,640
That night,

445
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,720
they have a strategy meeting
at a restaurant

446
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,680
that serves their local speciality,
boar-pig hybrid.

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,800
Inoppe, it's not Inoppe.

448
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,720
- It's not Inoppe.
- It's not Inoppe.

449
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,360
Inoppe? It's not Inoppe.

450
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,480
It's not Inoppe. Yumeppe, could you
do a gourmet report?

451
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,600
How does
the boar-pig hybrid skewer taste?

452
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,640
This is delicious.

453
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,400
It looks delicious.

454
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,720
This is delicious.

455
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm really shocked.

456
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,400
You know at the end,

457
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,840
I think it's all about this.

458
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,360
This is what will make it happen.

459
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Let's get it done.

460
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Let's get it done tomorrow for sure.

461
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,920
We discussed a lot
in this strategy meeting.

462
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm going to tell you this
since this is your first time.

463
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,160
Most of this won't be used.

464
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,120
You saw that with
Imoto's episode, right?

465
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
- Yes.
- Weren't you like, "What?"

466
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
Actually, my son said,
"That was short."

467
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,040
Will they succeed tomorrow?

468
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,960
The fourth day on location
starts with a challenge

469
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,000
for the new Degawa girl.

470
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,520
You are now a Degawa girl,

471
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
so we need you to take on
The Quest style.

472
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
- Flying frisbee catch.
- So suddenly?

473
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,120
- Flying frisbee catch?
- Flying frisbee catch?

474
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,640
Oh!

475
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,400
- Am I going to do it?
- Yes.

476
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,440
I can finally participate.

477
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm happy about it.

478
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
- I'm ready!
- Okay!

479
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
- Here's her first attempt!
- She's all enthusiastic.

480
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,440
- She's very eager to do it.
- Her eagerness

481
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
- is amazing.
- That's great.

482
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,760
Amazing.

483
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,520
- That was close!
- That was close!

484
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,840
Oh man!

485
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,080
Her reach was only three centimetres
away from the frisbee.

486
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,240
- That was close.
- That was close.

487
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,880
- That was so close.
- I'm ready!

488
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Okay!

489
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,160
Her second attempt.
Will she succeed?

490
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
She's wonderful.

491
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,000
- Oh no!
- Incredible.

492
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
It's looking good so far.

493
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,240
- I caught it!
- She caught it.

494
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
She succeeds!

495
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,640
- I caught it!
- What's at the end?

496
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
She slipped and hit her head,

497
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,000
however, that didn't stop her
from catching the frisbee.

498
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,640
She's really strong. I'm impressed.

499
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,120
This is what you call
a fresh tangerine from Fukushima!

500
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,600
I did it!

501
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,920
This is super fun!

502
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,920
And at night, Yumeppe repeatedly
comes close to catching it.

503
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,080
Oh no.

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,440
It hit my clavicle.

505
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,160
Looking good!

506
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
- It doesn't seem too windy either.
- Ouch.

507
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
Her head!

508
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,760
And finally...

509
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
it hits her lips.

510
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,160
- Ouch!
- Did it hit you?

511
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,720
- This is so annoying!
- You got some on you.

512
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
- This is even more annoying.
- You got it on you.

513
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,000
It's their last day on location,
with no success.

514
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,000
They could catch it any second.

515
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,960
Ouch!

516
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,160
And Yumeppe is the only one
who's come close to catching it,

517
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,840
and Degawa is nowhere to be found
at this point.

518
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,320
It's sweet.

519
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,760
So you can taste it too, then.

520
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,040
I shouldn't say this,

521
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
but I think Yumeppe can catch it.

522
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,600
However, it's their last night
at the baseball field.

523
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,400
Let's do our best here!

524
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,880
Let's do it!

525
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,720
Everyone cheers for them.

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
We'll catch it for sure!

527
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,400
We only have limited time left,
we'll definitely do our best!

528
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,200
- Yes!
- I'll catch it!

529
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,200
- Yes!
- Great.

530
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,120
They want to succeed
for everyone there.

531
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,760
They frantically run after
a marshmallow the whole time.

532
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,960
It's in your way!

533
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,200
Boy... how many centimetres
am I off here?

534
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,200
They can't end until they succeed.

535
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,160
That's the job of a Degawa girl
that Yumeppe yeaned for.

536
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,040
Ouch!

537
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,240
- She has yellow on there.
- Look below her eyes.

538
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,560
It's yellow.

539
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,080
It's starting to make me laugh.

540
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,680
She's got tears in her eyes,

541
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,920
because it's very painful when
a marshmallow hits her face.

542
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
It must hurt.

543
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,800
It'll happen. It's going to happen.

544
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,680
She doesn't want to end her first
location as a failure.

545
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,720
Front!

546
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,720
That was close.

547
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Your mouth?

548
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,480
That must hurt.

549
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,520
Wow!

550
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,120
Again.

551
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
It tastes like marshmallow.

552
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,640
She's tasting marshmallow
for the second time.

553
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,480
Darn it! I want to taste
a marshmallow too!

554
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,000
I am yet...

555
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm yet to taste one.

556
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,280
He's become a corner man.

557
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,600
However, the time has finally come
for Degawa to prove himself.

558
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,440
That was wasted.

559
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,040
Darn it!

560
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,400
This is so...

561
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,720
Now, they have one hour left
of the challenge.

562
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,320
So now we asked Sakai, who's
been with us for the past five days,

563
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,720
as well as Kodaira and Hanai
who've been shooting marshmallows,

564
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,680
to join the challenge as well.

565
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
We've been working hard together
doing this,

566
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,160
so let's ask them!

567
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,800
- What?
- Yes!

568
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,080
"Advisor's fist bad joke of 2021"

569
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,600
- Yes.
- Wait one second.

570
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm sorry. That wasn't appropriate
right now.

571
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,680
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you were going to say,

572
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,080
"We've been working hard together,
so two of us will finish it off!"

573
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,720
But instead, you were like,
"Let's ask them!"

574
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
Let's ask them.

575
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,160
Then the two young men show off
magnificent physical abilities.

576
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,360
- Did it hit you?
- Yes.

577
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,840
- That's great.
- It hit you?

578
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,160
It hit you?

579
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
What? Both of you?

580
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,360
That's so cool.

581
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,680
They come close several times
after that as well.

582
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,680
- My right eye.
- My right eye too.

583
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,080
What? Both of you?

584
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,680
Finally, they only have enough time
to try three more times.

585
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,440
Last three!

586
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,040
Yes!

587
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,160
- Three more attempts.
- Go for it!

588
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,240
- Two, one!
- A miracle.

589
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,080
Will they succeed?

590
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,320
Come!

591
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,120
They only have enough time
to try three more times.

592
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,560
Three more attempts!

593
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
Yes!

594
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,240
- Three more attempts.
- Three,

595
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
- Go for it!
- Two,

596
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,600
- one!
- A miracle.

597
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,320
Will they succeed?

598
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,120
- Come!
- Someone!

599
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,440
Someone!

600
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,560
Ah!

601
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
It hits Hanai's lips.

602
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,600
That was so close.

603
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,920
It went in a little. I tasted it.

604
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,080
Only the few can taste the taste.

605
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,200
Now, two more attempts left.

606
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,680
We are ready!

607
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
I did my best for three years
with Japanese baseball,

608
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,000
although I never played a game.
Please, god of baseball.

609
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,480
Three,

610
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
two, one.

611
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,320
Will they succeed?

612
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,760
Go!

613
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,560
That was close!

614
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,440
He's like a little dinosaur.

615
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,080
Right here.

616
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,240
Oh man!

617
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,440
Did you taste it?

618
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,560
No, I didn't.

619
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,160
I can't even taste it,
since it hit me here.

620
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,280
This is the last one.

621
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,040
Let one of us catch it for sure!

622
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,400
Yes!

623
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,160
- That voice.
- This is the last attempt.

624
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,560
Will their wish be fulfilled?

625
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,640
Go!

626
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
That was close!

627
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,560
The last one hit Yumeppe
near her mouth.

628
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,240
They failed.

629
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,320
- Ouch...
- That hurts.

630
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,880
Wow, you got some on there.

631
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
I tasted the most marshmallow
with this one.

632
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
Wow.

633
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Yumeppe.

634
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,800
I'm so disappointed.

635
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Yumeppe.

636
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Innocent tears that won't be shed

637
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,920
by any of the current Quest members.

638
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,760
-That is so true. Do you get it?
- This is the breath of fresh air

639
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,000
we were looking for!

640
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,760
- This is it.
- When he saw her tears,

641
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,280
this man sympathised and cried, too.

642
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,480
Yumeppe, you worked really hard.

643
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,160
You came so close,
with so many attempts.

644
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
This is really disappointing.
Really disappointing.

645
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,960
We are truly sorry towards Kajiyama,
but...

646
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,360
So what should we do, Yumeppe?

647
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,320
Should we try marshmallow catch
for the third time?

648
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,520
Please let us do it!

649
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,560
Everyone, thank you for helping us
for so many days, and I'm sorry too.

650
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,440
Thank you very much.

651
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,480
Thank you.

652
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,760
We weren't successful
in marshmallow catch again.

653
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,120
We'll do it again!

654
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Yeah!

655
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,080
Advisor, Yumeppe and Kajiyama
Vacuum Solution employees,

656
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,080
thank you for your hard work!

657
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,480
- That was great.
- Amazing.

658
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,600
So once again, here's Yumena Yanai,
the new Degawa girl.

659
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,080
"Yumena Yanai"

660
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,720
- Yumeppe!
- Yumeppe!

661
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,040
What did you think after
watching this?

662
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,040
I remembered how I was disappointed,
and it made me tear up again.

663
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,360
Everyone, this is it.

664
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,840
We all forgot about this, right?

665
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,080
- We have.
- My heart aches.

666
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,080
We've never seen such beautiful
tears in this programme, right?

667
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,080
We've only seen tears shed
from greed.

668
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,280
Greed.

669
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,200
When I saw her last tears,
it made me think about it.

670
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,280
Thank you!

671
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
This innocence

672
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,400
- is what The Quest was missing.
- Right.

673
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,520
- She came from Fukushima.
- Amazing.

674
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,480
She tried so hard,
and she sounds great too.

675
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,480
Her strong voice
when she goes, "Ready!"

676
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,960
I only have good impressions
of Yumeppe.

677
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,840
She went and did that slider
on her own,

678
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,440
and she didn't even hesitate
to do it.

679
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
She didn't even say, "Again?"

680
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,000
If I hit my head like that, I would
be like, "Did you simulate that?"

681
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,320
- You're right.
- I would totally say it.

682
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,480
The other members are much
older than her, right?

683
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,520
And she could be
our daughter's age...

684
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,560
She's very pure.

685
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,920
I could watch her forever.

686
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
I mean I could watch her forever.

687
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
- I still want to see it.
- I want to see more.

688
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,400
I want to see more of her.

689
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,920
I just realised none of us
are in our 20s anymore.

690
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,320
- She's 20 years old.
- You're right.

691
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm grateful. Thank you.

692
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,400
Let's try our best from now on too.

693
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,960
Next, an hour and a half away
from Tokyo on Shinkansen.

694
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,000
It's Asako Ito's Mystery Tour
in Aichi.

695
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
She came to Toyokawa Inari,

696
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,040
one of the three notable
Inari temples of Japan.

697
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,960
Isn't it intriguing?

698
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
- She's all winkled up.
- What's intriguing is

699
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,960
that my height
is shrinking every year,

700
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,240
but my feet are getting bigger
for some reason.

701
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm experiencing
this terrifying phenomenon.

702
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,800
A mysterious phenomenon where
her body is giving in to gravity.

703
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,400
My feet

704
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,720
used to be 24.5cm, but now
25.5 cm is too tight for me too.

705
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,120
So now the stylist is starting
to give me nasty looks.

706
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,600
She was like, "We don't have any
ladies' shoes in that size."

707
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,680
People come to pray for business
prosperity at Toyokawa Inari.

708
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,240
There was a rumour that spread
by word of mouth.

709
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,520
A rock?

710
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,280
This thing here?
What is the big deal about this?

711
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,960
This rock holds coins of the people
who came to visit this temple,

712
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,640
and the rumour has it that
if you take it home, you'll be rich.

713
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,440
If that's the case,
I'll thoroughly look for it.

714
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,480
They probably place it in here,
so it's hard to grab.

715
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,320
Asako believed it
and is searching for it, but...

716
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,000
These are precious money offerings
from the devotees.

717
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,480
She's enthusiastically searching,

718
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,600
but please do not take
money offerings home with you.

719
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,280
That's right.
The rumour is a complete hoax.

720
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,080
You won't be blessed,
but will be punished.

721
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
Ah! I found one!

722
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,000
I found a coin!

723
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,560
So is it a blessing since
we take home this coin

724
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,960
that's hard to take out from here?

725
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,320
You won't be blessed with anything,
even if you take it.

726
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,360
Don't be so greedy
with your own desires.

727
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,640
- That's what it is.
- Don't be so self-centred,

728
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,120
but reflect on yourself and be
grateful. That's very important.

729
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,680
I think so too.

730
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,160
Let's start
the Mystery Tour in Aichi!

731
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,520
First up is Nagoya's speciality.

732
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,040
A mysterious dance where
ladies have to endure pain.

733
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,000
- Look, there's a pretty girl.
- She's cute.

734
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm Suzume. I'm a Maiko from Nagoya.

735
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,880
The dance is
a traditional dance of Meigiren,

736
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,080
a group that represents
Maiko in Nagoya.

737
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
Before we start working as Maiko,

738
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,880
there is a dance
we must learn first.

739
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,280
What is this traditional dance
that comes with pain?

740
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,280
- What could it be?
- Shachihoko.

741
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,320
Shachihoko? Wait!

742
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,560
This is Nagoya's Maiko speciality,

743
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,400
- dance of the golden Shachihoko.
- Because it's Nagoya.

744
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,280
It's Nagoya!

745
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,840
- That's what it is!
- Yes.

746
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,760
Until they can do it properly.

747
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
Fast learners are able to do it
in a month.

748
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,120
I can't do that!

749
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,400
Let's try it!

750
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,600
Basics are simple. You are to place
your arms in front of the chest.

751
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,600
The head is lowered by setting
the arms as a pivotal point,

752
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,240
then the legs go up in the air
like a see-saw.

753
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,520
Ouch.

754
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,800
That hurt.

755
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,480
- I'm going to lift your legs.
- It's much harder than it looks.

756
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,040
This is how it is,
even with four people.

757
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,120
It hurts.

758
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,920
Younger Maiko seem to do it
with such ease...

759
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,640
But they are shaking too.

760
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,760
When you take a closer look...

761
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,520
It hurts so much that they shake.

762
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,960
What is this trick?

763
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,920
They are all desperate to get
Asako to do the Shachihoko move.

764
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,800
- It's impossible.
- Her body is positioned wrong.

765
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
It's impossible.

766
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,080
My face really hurts.

767
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,560
This lady who suddenly interrupted

768
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,320
is Maiko, who is a legendary dancer
of Meigiren.

769
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,560
Put strings on her.

770
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,200
- Put strings on her?
- The other trick.

771
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,000
This is known as
the Shachihoko ring.

772
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,600
It's a trick to keep the arms still
as a pivot by immobilizing the arms.

773
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
You know...

774
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
that looks like hell.

775
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,440
- Then...
- You can do it.

776
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,120
Her legs went up in the air.

777
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,800
You got it!

778
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,960
How can I get up now?

779
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,880
What she is,
is not Shachihoko, but...

780
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,520
You look like a sea lion.

781
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,640
She practised for three hours.

782
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,360
Here's Nagoya's traditional dance,
Shachihoko dance performance!

783
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,080
Excuse me.

784
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,440
Asako, 50 years old. Looks great
in these types of outfits.

785
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,160
- She looks good in it.
- Nice to meet you.

786
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,080
The dance of the Golden Shachihoko
performance starts.

787
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,320
I'm accompanied by the others.

788
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,680
Great.

789
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,920
That's Tomio Umezawa.

790
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,760
The wig and the kimono weigh
about six kilograms.

791
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,400
Additional weight makes it harder
to do the Shachihoko move.

792
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,600
She must put on the Shachihoko ring
without being noticed.

793
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,480
Now, she gets the ring ready.

794
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,720
Shachihoko.

795
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,120
All of a sudden,
she starts to sing very slowly.

796
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,720
She's trying to buy
some time for her.

797
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,280
- Amazarashi.
- Go for it!

798
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,040
Time for Shachihoko, will she go up?

799
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,160
- She does it successfully!
- Amazing.

800
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Her expression was great just now.

801
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,520
Great.

802
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
That was amazing.

803
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,920
You always perform well.

804
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,240
So you'll make your debut now.

805
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,480
Yes, and I shall retire today.

806
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,560
Now, let us introduce you to two
incredible craftsmen of Aichi.

807
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,240
First, he's the best in Japan.
A thickness of 1/1000 millimetres.

808
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,200
Hello.

809
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

810
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,760
These are the craftsmen.
It's Mitsuya the boss and Hosoda.

811
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,000
What is your speciality?

812
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,240
We specialise in planing wood.

813
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,480
Hosoda displayed
amazing shaving techniques

814
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,120
to produce the thinnest slices,

815
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,320
to win a competition of woodworkers.

816
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,080
Its thickness
was 1/1,000 millimetre.

817
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,520
It's thinner than
1/10 of a tissue paper.

818
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Please take a look
at his magnificent technique.

819
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Amazing.

820
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,760
That is so thin.

821
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,200
The shaved wood is so thin
that you can see through it.

822
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,800
Planing process is necessary
to polish wood and for durability.

823
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,160
Its finish is considerably better
when it's thinner.

824
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,320
Its thinness is...

825
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,880
Wow! It's 0.007.

826
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,640
Incredible!

827
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,920
Look at the polished finish
of the wood.

828
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,480
- Magnificent!
- Incredible!

829
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,960
Look what you can do
with the shaved wood!

830
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,760
Hello everyone! I'm Minami Asakura,

831
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,080
50 years old!

832
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,440
- There!
- She's gotten old.

833
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,320
What time is it?

834
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,360
This hurts.

835
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,720
That's no joke.

836
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,920
Next is super eccentric!

837
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
The world's best master hairdresser.

838
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,400
This is Katagiri.

839
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
He's actually...

840
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,520
I'm the world champion

841
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,440
- in this industry.
- What?

842
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,920
Katagiri is a master hairdresser
who has won several competitions,

843
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,360
equivalent to the Olympic games
of this industry.

844
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,760
He's currently the official trainer
for team Japan,

845
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,960
as well as the judge
for the world championships.

846
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,560
What's eccentric is his technique.

847
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,400
This is the technique he did
at the world championship in 2016.

848
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,240
That's interesting.

849
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,720
It's flattening out.

850
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,160
He then bundles up the hair
that's been sprayed with a comb,

851
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,800
to create a design.

852
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
That's pretty!

853
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,240
It's almost done, but Katagiri seems
to be bothered about something.

854
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,600
This is no joke.

855
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,280
I think the competitor will question
my ability.

856
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,000
Really?

857
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,800
I hope my competitors' TV
stops working.

858
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,920
This is his finished work.

859
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
An eccentric ducktail.

860
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,400
It seems magnificent,
but he is not satisfied with it.

861
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,000
It was something to do
with the colours.

862
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,000
You're his wife.

863
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,080
What do you think of your
husband's work?

864
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,720
It shouldn't be made public.

865
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,680
That's harsh.

866
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,320
Katagiri is proud of this one.

867
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,000
Its colours and designs
are detailed,

868
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,880
and the silhouette
has a nice right angle to it.

869
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,400
- I guess it is different.
- So it's different.

870
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,520
Amazing.

871
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,080
Asako will try
an eccentric hairstyle.

872
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,080
You look like Ochimusha.

873
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,440
I'll leave it to you today.

874
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,920
First, her hair is made wavy
with a curling iron.

875
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,120
Then it's sprayed
to shape your hair.

876
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,040
Wow, this is amazing.

877
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Wow, this is amazing!

878
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,040
Then it's coloured.

879
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,200
What does her hair look like now?

880
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,640
Let's see it now!

881
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,480
That's great.

882
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,480
Hello,

883
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,720
I'm Shachi Hokoko.

884
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,600
She reminded us of something...

885
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,200
She looks like Yokai Amabie.

886
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,640
You two created this together.
What do you think?

887
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,920
It's funny.

888
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,160
It's funny? What?

889
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,760
That night.

890
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,880
Tonight, we can actually see
the Northern Taurids.

891
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,400
Really?

892
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,240
She came to Okumikawa, known
as the holy land of the starry sky.

893
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,720
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

894
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,880
These two are Goto and Hagino,
the starry sky guides.

895
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,200
It comes every year,

896
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,560
but you only see a few even
if you observe it for an hour.

897
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,000
So it all depends on your luck.

898
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Don't you want to wish for something
if you see are shooting star?

899
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,920
You do say that.

900
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,360
What would be
your best three wishes?

901
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,840
- Right now?
- Yes.

902
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,720
Why do I have to tell you
before I see a shooting star?

903
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,720
Am I supposed to tell you?

904
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,400
Then grant my wishes then.

905
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,720
Asako's very fist wish is...

906
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,880
World peace.

907
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,480
- That's great.
- I've been wishing for that.

908
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,720
Don't chuckle. I'm serious here.

909
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,920
Do you have any other wishes?

910
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,520
If I have to come up with one...

911
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,720
Her second wish is...

912
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,080
I want my cholesterol level
to decrease.

913
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,520
That's random.

914
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,080
- That's so random.
- I said if I have to choose one.

915
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,160
And her third wish is...

916
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,120
I want my hair to stop thinning.

917
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
You hair is thinning?

918
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,160
My good friend Okubo's dog, Pakomi

919
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,720
eats my hair along my forehead.

920
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,360
So my forehead keeps getting
wider and wider.

921
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,840
Let's start stargazing!

922
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,680
The weather is clear.
It's a perfect day for stargazing.

923
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,000
- The weather was super nice.
- That's beautiful.

924
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,840
Please enjoy the starry sky
shot in time-lapse.

925
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,440
Taurus is this upside-down V here.

926
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,640
The shooting stars are seen
over an extensive area around there.

927
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,120
It's all about widening your vision.

928
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,440
That's the determining factor.

929
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,800
Come on, shooting star!

930
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,080
Come on!

931
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,960
That is when...

932
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,160
Please watch
the bottom of the screen.

933
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
There it is!

934
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,040
- Really?
- Where?

935
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,000
- It was quite big.
- No way!

936
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,320
Did you make a wish?

937
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,320
I didn't.

938
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,480
I just thought, "It appeared!"

939
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,040
It's coming!

940
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,800
The wave is coming!

941
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,720
It's coming.

942
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,000
Will she be able to make a wish
with the next one?

943
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,440
Ah! Thinning hair!

944
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,320
That was something else.
I saw the trail for a second.

945
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,160
- There's another one!
- Thinning hair!

946
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,240
The final one is a mysterious group,

947
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,040
where the elderlies
dance their hearts out.

948
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
What?

949
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,920
She came to Miyoshi,
located east of Nagoya.

950
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
Good morning.

951
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

952
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
These are them.

953
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
What do they do?

954
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,920
So you dance your heart out?

955
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,240
Ready...

956
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,520
We do synchronised swimming.

957
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,520
They are a synchronised
swimming team of elderlies.

958
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,080
Their average age is 67 years old.

959
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,480
They met at a swimming class,

960
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,280
and they perform several times
a year at an event and competitions.

961
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,520
If you don't mind me asking,
how old are you?

962
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,280
I'll be 80 this month.

963
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,680
- What?
- She looks younger.

964
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,160
Amazing!
You don't look like it at all!

965
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,640
Anyway, let's start practising
synchronised swimming.

966
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,080
Thank you.

967
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,600
They will be coached by Ms Higaki.

968
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,640
Asako is 50 years old,

969
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,080
but she's
one of the younger ones here.

970
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,320
Can you swim about 10 metres?

971
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,480
What?

972
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,960
Can you swim about 10 metres?

973
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,920
Yes.

974
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,960
Here? There?

975
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,120
From here to there.

976
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,000
- From the edge?
- No, from there.

977
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,400
If you can just swim...

978
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,360
- From over there?
- From there!

979
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,280
Their conversation is going nowhere.

980
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,080
Do you want to clip it?

981
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,240
I don't know.
I don't have a nasal bone.

982
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,200
- What?
- I don't have one either.

983
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,280
It's fine. it's fine.

984
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,120
We have even less!

985
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,200
A puzzling conversation.

986
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,240
Some of you may
have noticed already,

987
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,280
but their synchronised swimming
touches the bottom of the pool.

988
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,280
Asako, okay!

989
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,680
You're young.

990
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,920
Not at all.

991
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,880
She hasn't heard that in a while.

992
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
Ready, go!

993
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,640
Amazing!

994
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,640
How do you float in this condition?

995
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,920
With our own fat.

996
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,280
I need to eat more then.

997
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,880
She practised for three full hours.

998
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,960
How did it turn out?

999
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,160
Go team!

1000
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,120
Synchronised swimming show.

1001
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,760
"Average age 67 years old.
Miyoshi Tante Tante and Asako"

1002
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,840
Solemn sisters enter.

1003
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,880
They are all looking to the side.

1004
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
They all are.

1005
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,080
- It's Sister Act.
- Yes, it is.

1006
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,640
Okay.

1007
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,720
Their timing is a little off,

1008
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,560
but that makes them
even more charming.

1009
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,040
That's cute.

1010
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,560
We can't tell Asako apart anymore.

1011
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,680
Where is she?

1012
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,520
Darn it.

1013
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,960
Godaigo's Galaxy Express 999,
with a nostalgic touch.

1014
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,840
"Ballet leg"

1015
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,080
They all frantically
swim underwater.

1016
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,840
That's incredible.

1017
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,320
Now, they will all do a handstand
at the same time.

1018
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,840
That's impressive.

1019
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,040
Their average age is 67 years old.

1020
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,640
That's lots of physical activity.

1021
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,720
All of a sudden,
music from Demon Slayer plays.

1022
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,680
Why?

1023
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Here comes the final move.

1024
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,520
Grandma lift.

1025
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,600
Amazing.

1026
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,280
What's incredible is everyone's
physical strength.

1027
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,160
We don't get that tired,
even when we do this.

1028
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,720
We do this after we swim.

1029
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,120
Consider their strong mentality,
just talking away at the camera.

1030
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,160
So that concludes
Asako's Mystery Tour.

1031
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,480
Yumena, what did you think?

1032
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,400
Good work.

1033
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,720
It really was incredible.
