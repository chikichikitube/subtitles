1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,360
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Today's first segment is...

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,160
Daisuke Miyagawa's
Way to Japanese Festivals.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,880
A certain day.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,080
Gosh, you startled me!

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,480
Come on,
I was going to watch the telly.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,200
There's a photo
I'd like to show you.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,120
What is it?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,920
Oh, he lifted up the rock
the other day.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,080
Mr Takeuchi.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,520
Mr Takeuchi from the Rock Lifting
Competition Miyagawa joined,

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,520
and Mr Hayashi
from Gon Gon Festival.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,160
The two gentlemen
are in the same photo.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,920
- Gon Gon Festival was held in 2021.
- Okay.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,200
What? He joined God Gon Festival?

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,560
The two gentlemen had a match,

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
and they sent us the happy news.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,280
Lovely!

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,720
It makes me happy
that they're connected.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,640
Thank you for making it lively
for us.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
It's enough to make me cry.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
The stages this time are Fukui
Prefecture and Kochi Prefecture.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,120
I went to Fukui Prefecture
quite a lot.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,720
It's a bit related to you...

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,440
Glasses!

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,760
Fukui Prefecture is famous
for its glasses.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,960
What do we compete at,
using glasses?

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,440
What kind of festival
is waiting for him?

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,640
Welcome to The Quest.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,800
Today, it's Daisuke Miyagawa's
Way to Japanese Festivals,

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,400
and The Quest Hot Spring Club.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,600
Wasshoi!

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,560
"Morisanchu"

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,480
Hello...

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,400
Hello!

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,000
Hello, everyone!

37
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,840
What?

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,560
It's over. My shoulders are over.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,520
It's over for my shoulders
if I do this.

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
They will after this practise.

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
Hiroshima!

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
Don't grab!

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Hang in there, Machan!

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,600
Daisuke Miyagawa's
Way to Japanese Festivals.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,000
He has come to Sabae City,
Fukui Prefecture.

46
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Wasshoi!

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,400
The place I have come to

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,480
is Sabae City in Fukui Prefecture.

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
Look at the signboard there.

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,320
It's a glasses frame,

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,160
it says "Sabae."

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,680
If the festival is about glasses,
I definitely don't want to lose.

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
Hey!

54
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,360
Festival Guy in Sabae!

55
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,000
- Bring it on.
- You waited too long.

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,000
Our guide this time

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,880
is Director-general
of Fukui Optical Association,

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,720
Mr Yasutaka Shimamura.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,600
Say it again. What association?

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm Fukui Optical Association's
Shimamura.

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes, glasses!

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,280
- It's a nice frame.
- Thank you.

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,960
Please tell me what you take
seriously about glasses.

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
It looks heavy, but it's
surprisingly light when you wear it.

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,400
The glasses are light
when you wear them.

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,440
My facial features are quite close
together in the centre.

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,160
I want them to look wider apart,
so I use a bigger frame.

68
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
Scattering glasses.

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,120
- The festival held in Sabae here.
- Yes?

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
Is it dangerous?

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,960
- It isn't dangerous.
- No, right?

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,920
Can I ask the name of the event?

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
It's called Megamori.

74
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,400
What? After all these...

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,760
It's food?

76
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,160
Megamori?

77
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,760
They go to the venue that will be
the stage of the battle.

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,080
Mr Miyagawa,
please have a look at that.

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,480
- What?
- What did Miyagawa see?

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,360
It's men who are wearing
many pairs of glasses.

81
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,520
Megamori means a lot of glasses?

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,480
Megamori is an event
that participants compete to see

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,600
who wears more pairs of glasses
on their face.

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,800
80 percent of the glasses frames
made in Japan

85
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,840
are produced in Sabae City.

86
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,840
It's one of the three major glasses
frames production area in the world.

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,880
Glasses Festival is held every year,

88
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,160
Megamori started in 2014
as an event of the festival.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,840
But it was cancelled last year
because of the pandemic.

90
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,280
People in the city pray
it'll be held this year.

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,040
That's many pairs of glasses!
Amazing!

92
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,840
- It's exciting, right?
- Yes.

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,200
It makes people smile,
from children to adults.

94
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,320
It looks so stupid.

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
The rule is very simple.

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,600
Put as many pairs of glasses in
the basket as you can on your face

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
in the one-minute time limit.

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,200
Stop for five seconds when it ends,

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,360
and the number of glasses that stay
will be recorded.

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
If they all fall when you say stop

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,240
and three pairs stay,
that'll be the record.

102
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,680
Three will be the record.

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,480
The way they count the number
is also full of love for glasses.

104
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
The Glasses Festival is set up
as a festival to thank our glasses,

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,360
so we fold them one by one
and say thank you.

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,560
We say thank you,
and continue to count.

107
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,240
Fold, and "thank you."

108
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,600
Thank you.

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,920
- Can I ask, Mr Shimamura?
- Go ahead.

110
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,760
How many pairs did the champion wear
to win?

111
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
35 pairs.

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,720
What?

113
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
My enemy is strong.

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Now, he'll do some practise.

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
Pile them tidily,
one above the other.

116
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,440
You have to pile them up precisely.

117
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
This festival is so fun!

118
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,280
First, he tries it in 30 seconds.

119
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
Ready, go.

120
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
Miyagawa is putting
the glasses on smoothly,

121
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
but...

122
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,400
It falls if he doesn't put them on
carefully enough.

123
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,360
Not the pair that fell.

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,360
- It's difficult.
- Yes.

125
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,000
They barely hang there.

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,080
Five seconds left.

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
What...

128
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,080
Two, one.

129
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Stop. Like this.

130
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,440
That's 30 seconds?

131
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
He'll stop for five seconds
after it ends.

132
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,040
I'll take them all off.

133
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,680
Didn't I put them on my face
surprisingly tidily?

134
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
Thank you.

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,240
Do not forget to express gratitude
to the glasses.

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
- Thank you.
- It's nice.

137
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
13 pairs.

138
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,320
We'll double it, so it's 26 pairs.

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
I need 10 more pairs
to catch up with the champion.

140
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,200
But it was only 30 seconds,

141
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,800
so it's going to get difficult
to find places to put them on.

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,480
It won't double just because
I did it for 30 seconds.

143
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,400
That's right.

144
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,560
I... Well, I want to win.

145
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,880
For example, it's not right
to put them here,

146
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,560
but it's quicker to wear them
than taking the time.

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I see.

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,800
This festival is so fun.

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,840
He tries it in one minute,
like the real competition.

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,000
Start.

151
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,440
The record of the champion
is 35 pairs,

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,600
what does that look like?

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,280
I'll put them on quickly.
I guess I shouldn't overdo it.

154
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
The glasses are piled up tidily.

155
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
It looks good.

156
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,640
The difficult part of this

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,960
is you gradually don't know
how you're piling up the glasses.

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,920
So when pairs of glasses overlap...

159
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,920
They fall, as you can see.

160
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,360
Also, he can't see ahead,

161
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,520
so he can't choose glasses
that are easy to wear.

162
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I see.

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,040
There is still space on the head
to wear them,

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
but Miyagawa can't see.

165
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,080
I see.

166
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400
I see.

167
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,880
- The last spurt.
- You can do it!

168
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Wow, it looks like
they are his eyes.

169
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,280
- Four, three, two, one.
- The lowest part.

170
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
Stop.

171
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,920
I think I wore many pairs.

172
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,440
Wow, he did so well!

173
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Oh, I think I made it, right?

174
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Then...

175
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,920
Thank you.

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
Thank you.

177
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,640
What's his record?

178
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,760
Thank you.

179
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
Thank you.

180
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Thank you. So...

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,320
24 pairs.

182
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,800
In fact, the real difficult part of
Megamori starts at the 25th pair.

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
Stop.

184
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,040
The same. 24 pairs.

185
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
He can't break his record.

186
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,760
25 pairs.
It's the barrier of 25 again!

187
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,960
This is the winning record so far.

188
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,200
The champion hit a big record
of 35 pairs in 2019.

189
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,440
Obviously it also depends on luck,

190
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,200
but there's a chance he can win
if he can wear 30 pairs.

191
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,280
There's a chance if I wear
as many as 28 pairs.

192
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,560
I'll do it like the real thing.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Miyagawa improves his concentration.

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Okay!

195
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,400
He's fired up!

196
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
He aims to wear 28 pairs.

197
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
You can do it.

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
Ready, start!

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,680
Start!

200
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,120
You can do it.

201
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,480
He put the glasses on
and leaves no gap.

202
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,480
You can do it.

203
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
Now is the crucial part.

204
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,600
How many more pairs of glasses
can he put on top of his head?

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,440
Miyagawa is grasping the feeling.

206
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
He looks very focused.

207
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,960
They get trapped by his hair
many times.

208
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,920
The pace he's putting them on at
isn't bad, either.

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,920
30 seconds left.

210
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,800
The sunglasses that might fall
are also fixed in place.

211
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,400
Wow, that was impressive!

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,280
He won't go past 25
if he makes any mistake.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
He isn't thinking.

214
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,240
The last spurt.

215
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,600
The glasses are coming apart,
but they manage to stay.

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
Wow, they're trapped!

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Impressive!

218
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
10 seconds left.

219
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,840
Isn't this really impressive?

220
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,480
- Don't let them fall...
- Don't let them fall!

221
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,040
- Amazing!
- Impressive!

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,720
- Stop.
- It's over.

223
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,680
I think I made it.

224
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,040
20.

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,840
What is his record?

226
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,960
28!

227
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Wow, maybe I can do it!

228
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,880
He achieved his goal, 28 pairs.

229
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,720
Somehow I really understand now.

230
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,680
I do better in a real match,

231
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,080
so I'm confident I can put on
over 30 pairs.

232
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,600
What's left
is the Champion's nerves.

233
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,800
I'd like the cooperation
of our crew.

234
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,560
Please put the camera
very close to his face.

235
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,720
And now is the time
for the final battle.

236
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,040
I must do it. I'll defeat him.
Call the champion here!

237
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
Champion twice in a row,

238
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,040
Mr Yamahara!

239
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,800
Megamori's absolute champion,

240
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,880
Hiromori Yamahara.

241
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,040
The way he carries himself
is like a glasses advert.

242
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,720
35 pairs in one minute.

243
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,440
This man made
an overwhelming world record.

244
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,600
He has a nice nose.

245
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,120
Mr Yamahara? Nice to meet you.

246
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,840
I just practised for a bit,

247
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,240
it's difficult.

248
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,280
It is difficult.

249
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,560
I watched a bit. You're good at it.

250
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
- Really?
- I'm in trouble.

251
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm a bit nervous.

252
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,440
- May I challenge you?
- Yes.

253
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
I'm looking forward to it.

254
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Let's do it, then.

255
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Megamori special version starts now.

256
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
The heated battle between men
in glasses is going to start.

257
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
The time limit is one minute.

258
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,760
The one who wears more pairs
of glasses on his face wins.

259
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,520
If Miyagawa wins, he'll be given
a pair of golden glasses.

260
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,760
If the champion wins, we'll give him
a happi with Miyagawa's autograph.

261
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,720
Mr Miyagawa, are you confident?

262
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,240
To be honest...

263
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,240
I think I can win.

264
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,560
Oh, Miyagawa is already giving
the champion pressure!

265
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,920
Of course...

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm nervous,

267
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
that's the key.

268
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,400
What Miyagawa said
is affecting the champion.

269
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,120
His face shows how nervous he is!

270
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,520
Now, the time has come!

271
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,120
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

272
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
Now, the fateful match...

273
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
- Start.
- starts!

274
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
They both start wearing glasses.

275
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,400
Oh, what's wrong?
The champion is already panicking!

276
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
He's very nervous.

277
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,840
But Miyagawa is calm.

278
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
He's piling them up beautifully.

279
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,800
This is Festival Guy
Daisuke Miyagawa for you!

280
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,160
He performs well in a real match!

281
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
Wow, wearing two together!

282
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,880
Is he loved by glasses?

283
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,800
Lucky Glasses.

284
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,520
At the same time,
the champion isn't any worse.

285
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,800
He's wearing the glasses nicely.

286
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,960
What's wrong?

287
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,960
Oh, the champion's glasses
fell apart!

288
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Will they hang in there?

289
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,720
Oh, they fell!

290
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,280
It's Miyagawa's chance!

291
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
You can do it!

292
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,680
Miyagawa is calm.

293
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,160
He doesn't slow down
and continues to wear glasses.

294
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,440
Amazing, Miyagawa! You can do it!

295
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,880
15 seconds left.

296
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,440
15 seconds left!

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,480
He'll surely win
if he doesn't make them fall!

298
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,680
The champion's fell apart!

299
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,600
Five seconds.

300
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,640
Five seconds left!
Can Miyagawa hold out?

301
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,040
- One. Stop.
- It's over!

302
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,360
Keep them there for five seconds.

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,120
Impressive!

304
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,320
- Yes! I must've won!
- Impressive!

305
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,720
Okay, I can take them off, right?

306
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes! I've surely won!

307
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,360
I must've won!

308
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
That was impressive.

309
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,520
I must've won!

310
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,320
Miyagawa clenches his fist
in triumph!

311
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,760
I was so nervous!

312
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,200
We were nervous, right?

313
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,520
- I was so nervous.
- It was bad.

314
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,920
I've never been so nervous
putting on glasses.

315
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,880
I was so nervous.
My hands are still shaking.

316
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,280
We'll announce the result!

317
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
The first one. One.

318
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,480
Thank you.

319
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,960
They express their gratitude
for glasses and count.

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Eleven.

321
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
Thank you.

322
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
The champion's record is...

323
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,960
12.

324
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,160
Thank you.

325
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
12 pairs!

326
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
25.

327
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,960
- Thank you!
- Amazing!

328
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,960
- Miyagawa's victory is certain.
- Awesome!

329
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,320
Now we'll see how far
his record will go.

330
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,600
27.

331
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,200
- Thank you!
- That's a big number.

332
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
28.

333
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,600
Thank you!

334
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,960
It broke the record
of Miyagawa's practise.

335
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,080
- 30.
- Thank you!

336
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,000
What's his record?

337
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,800
- 31.
- Thank you!

338
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
Miyagawa wore 31 pairs!

339
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,360
"Daisuke Miyagawa's record: 31"

340
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,400
Yes!

341
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,960
Miyagawa won for the first time
in a long while!

342
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,000
I got one lucky one.

343
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,520
It just hung here.

344
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
When I put it on my head,
it just got trapped.

345
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,960
It's your gold glasses medal.

346
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,720
Yay!

347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
Thank you!

348
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,840
We pray Megamori
will be held again someday.

349
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,840
The next place he goes to is...

350
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,720
Wasshoi!

351
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,720
The place I have come to

352
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,000
is Saoka, Yamada Town, Tosa,
Kami City, Kochi Prefecture!

353
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,360
Have a look at this!

354
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,600
It's a really quiet,
wonderful place!

355
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,120
Our guide

356
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,560
is Saoka Region Community
Promotion Council Chairman,

357
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
Mr Takumi Maeda.

358
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,320
Mr Maeda,
is this festival dangerous?

359
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,920
It isn't dangerous to common people,

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,760
it's simple, but difficult.

361
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,000
- It's simple, but difficult?
- That's right.

362
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,120
How long has the champion
been winning?

363
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,080
Two years.

364
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,360
Two years in a row.

365
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Kagami Town has its self-defence
force, he's a member of it.

366
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, no...

367
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,840
- I see, you need physical strength?
- That's right!

368
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,240
They go to the venue at once.

369
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,760
- Mr Miyagawa.
- Yes?

370
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
Have a look at that.

371
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
What?

372
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,880
What did Miyagawa see?

373
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,280
It's a man throwing scallion.

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,320
It's the Yakko Scallion Throwing
World Championship.

375
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,560
Kami City, Kochi Prefecture's
speciality is Yakko Scallion,

376
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,640
people throw it and compete
on who throws it furthest,

377
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,880
in the world championship.

378
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,960
The championship started in 2014.

379
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,920
At Saoka Spring Harvest Festival
held every year,

380
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,480
they used Kami City's speciality,
Yakko Scallion

381
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
to try revitalising the region,
and started the championship.

382
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,000
But it was cancelled in 2021
because of the pandemic.

383
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,800
The city's people pray
it can be held next year.

384
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
- This?
- That's right.

385
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,160
You can hold it and throw it
in whatever way you want,

386
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
just don't make it a ball.

387
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,640
Each person can throw two sticks,

388
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,520
but the scallion is so thin,
can it go that far?

389
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,360
Many people move too much to throw.

390
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
People usually do this.

391
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,560
Among them, some do an under throw.
Hold this part and throw like this.

392
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,360
I see, I see.

393
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,920
The world champion
throws above his head.

394
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
The second place throws from below.

395
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,080
How far can the champion throw it?

396
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,240
- 17.83 metres.
- What?

397
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
What?

398
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
We were shocked too.

399
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,960
That's close to the record
of throwing a softball.

400
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
So it's between 15m and 20m there.

401
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,920
It was in the middle.

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,040
Are you kidding me?

403
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,000
The tailwind must've been
rather strong.

404
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,520
Now Miyagawa will practise.

405
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,120
To be honest,
I have frozen shoulder now.

406
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
It hurts.

407
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,360
You're in a bit of trouble.
The champion is in his 20s.

408
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
I see...

409
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
This pain... Just a bit...

410
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,720
- Can I try it?
- Sure, go ahead.

411
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,840
I'll do it really lightly.

412
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
It went six metres away.

413
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,120
This is bad.

414
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,640
This...
Did he really throw that far?

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm really impressed
with the champion.

416
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,800
The second one.

417
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Oh, it's further.

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But that's it?

419
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,400
His record improved from just now,

420
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,920
but it landed at six metres.

421
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,440
- It's light, so it's impossible.
- Yes.

422
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,520
He tries using more force.

423
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,480
- See?
- That's right.

424
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,960
It's over for my shoulders!

425
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,120
No. It'll be over for my shoulders
if I do this.

426
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
I'll try the under throw.

427
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,760
- Try it.
- Use centrifugal force.

428
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,680
Use centrifugal force
and do an underhand throw!

429
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,880
It went up, but...

430
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,280
His record improved.

431
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,360
I can do this.
I think this is better for me.

432
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,840
I don't hold it tightly,

433
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,840
and throw it this way here.

434
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,120
Miyagawa found a way out.

435
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,760
He devises a certain way to throw.

436
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,920
How about spinning once?

437
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,240
He spins to use centrifugal force
to throw it.

438
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,520
Go!

439
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,760
It went far!

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,440
Go!

441
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,920
It went far!

442
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,040
It went further than 10 metres
the first time.

443
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Amazing!

444
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
The record improved dramatically.

445
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,560
Mr Murofushi's way is great!

446
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,760
You go like...

447
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,480
A hammer is the same
as Yakko Scallion.

448
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,280
I can stand by like this.

449
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,520
That's right.

450
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,560
After this...

451
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Look!

452
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,640
I've found it!

453
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
I've found it!

454
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,720
That's the Miyagawa Throw.

455
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,120
It is named Miyagawa Throw.

456
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,000
I want to go as far as I can
like this. Right?

457
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,320
But if I turn like this,
I'm going to try not to fall,

458
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,200
so I'll hold myself back.

459
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,800
My attention will be on my leg
over here.

460
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,840
But...

461
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,240
How did I move my legs?

462
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
- Which one?
- The other.

463
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,160
Which one? Hang on...

464
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,680
Then I put my weight here...

465
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,520
- Impressive!
- Amazing.

466
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,480
"14 metres mark"

467
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,760
- That went 14 metres?
- Yes, 14 metres.

468
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,640
It's possible now. It's right there.

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,440
- The champion's is there.
- Yes, over there.

470
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,360
But the centrifugal force
is too strong,

471
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,080
my blood goes there at once,

472
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
and my palm stings.

473
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,640
Miyagawa Throw is a two-edged sword,

474
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,240
the extreme spin causes blood
to gather at his fingertips.

475
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,800
Two-edged sword?

476
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,840
What two-edged sword?

477
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,280
I'll let it rest a bit.

478
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,720
It strains the body tremendously,

479
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,600
so the real match's two times
is all he can do.

480
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
He ends his practise now.

481
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,520
Daisuke, you really hate practising.

482
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,080
No, I don't.

483
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,080
That puts a strong centrifugal force
on my hand.

484
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,680
You'll be surprised.
If I go all out,

485
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,680
- my whole arm stings.
- Is it that bad?

486
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,640
It's true!

487
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
The final battle starts.

488
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,880
The final battle starts.

489
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,400
Yakko Scallion Throwing
World Championship,

490
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,280
champion twice in a row,
Mr Ishizaki!

491
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,880
This is the champion twice in a row

492
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,560
in Yakko Scallion Throwing
World Championship, Koji Ishizaki.

493
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
He's active in the force.

494
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,400
The champion looks strong!

495
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,000
He is a self-defence officer and a
former high school baseball player.

496
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,120
When did you make this record?

497
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,720
- About three years ago.
- Three years ago?

498
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,320
Is there a trick to it?

499
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,160
You know the result
the moment you choose the scallion.

500
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,680
I threw 14.4 metres
when I was practising.

501
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
Isn't it impressive
as the first time?

502
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,440
Yes, I think you can compete
for championship.

503
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,560
- Right?
- But 14 metres can't win.

504
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,520
You said it, Champion.
You can't beat me!

505
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
I'm not going to lose, either.

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
Now, let's do it.

507
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Yakko Scallion Throwing
World Championship, special version,

508
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,800
starts now.

509
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,200
I will explain the rules.

510
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,160
Each person can throw two scallions.

511
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,760
The person
who throws it further wins.

512
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,320
If Miyagawa wins, he'll be given
a box of Yakko Scallion.

513
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,640
The champion goes first.

514
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,240
It's important to choose scallion
with a heavy root,

515
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,720
and the green part
should be straight.

516
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,080
That's what he says.

517
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,040
Miyagawa watches him do it.

518
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
- Okay.
- The champion chose

519
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,280
his best scallion.

520
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
He walks up to the stage
of the match.

521
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,880
How is he going to throw
the scallion?

522
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,800
- "Southpaw."
- It's "Southpaw."

523
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
The first throw
that has everyone's attention!

524
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,960
Wow, impressive!

525
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,200
He threw it!

526
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,560
How far?

527
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,280
The record is...

528
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,400
13.1 metres.

529
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,960
It's 13.1 metres!

530
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
A good match.

531
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
The champion is cornered.

532
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay...

533
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,400
I think he's nervous.

534
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,040
Miyagawa's facial expression!

535
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,320
Can the champion show his pride?

536
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,520
I'll throw now.

537
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,160
The second throw decides his fate!

538
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,840
It flew!

539
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,160
Yes!

540
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,360
Wow, it's a lot further
than 15 metres!

541
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,560
He did a perfect throw!

542
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
The way he threw it was impressive.

543
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,360
What is the record?

544
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,480
It's 16 metres...

545
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,320
and 82 centimetres.

546
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,040
The champion made
a brilliant record!

547
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,080
Thank you.

548
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,920
I'll go further than 18 metres!

549
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
- Good!
- You can do it!

550
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,560
I'll go further than 18 metres!

551
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,920
- Good!
- You can do it!

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,520
He can't let himself be beaten!

553
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,440
Festival Guy, Daisuke Miyagawa
is here!

554
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Choose the scallion.

555
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,160
Miyagawa said he'd do his
Miyagawa Throw twice in the match.

556
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,840
Even if it ruins his body,

557
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,840
he'll twist until his body
reaches its limit!

558
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,040
Now, he walks up
to the stage of the match.

559
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,800
Show him your power!

560
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
- Miyagawa Throw.
- Okay!

561
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,480
He aims to throw past 16.82 metres!

562
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,760
Okay, I'll do it.

563
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,160
Miyagawa's first throw!

564
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
You can do it.

565
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,480
- It's lighter.
- It's slower.

566
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,640
How far?

567
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
No!

568
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
It didn't fly at all!

569
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,560
Oh, no...

570
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
What's the record?

571
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,280
13 metres.

572
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,320
- But there's 13 metres.
- 13 metres.

573
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,440
He used too much force
and the scallion didn't fly at all.

574
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,800
"Record: 13m"

575
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm cornered.
I'll make it next time!

576
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Laugh or cry,
he has only one more throw!

577
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,440
Miyagawa poses to throw.

578
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,160
I'll go all out. I have to.

579
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,480
- Be careful.
- "I have to go all out."

580
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,760
I'll throw.

581
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,960
The last throw!

582
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,480
How far?

583
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,160
It didn't go far!

584
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,800
What's the record?

585
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,920
11.86 metres.

586
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,320
Miyagawa is defeated.

587
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,320
"Record: 11m 86cm"

588
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,920
His eyes are teary.

589
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,480
- I'm totally defeated. Thank you.
- Thank you.

590
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,160
He was strong.

591
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,600
But it's one win and one loss
this time.

592
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,320
That's all for today. Thank you.

593
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,920
That's all
for Way to Japanese Festivals.

594
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,920
You're quiet.

595
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,800
What was it? Somehow...

596
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
- What's the matter?
- Somehow...

597
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
It was one win and one loss,

598
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,720
you looked like you accomplished
your job when it ended.

599
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,600
You won the first glasses match
and I was very happy for you,

600
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,720
but I wish it'd be something
that would make us feel anxious.

601
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,360
- Like, "Please do it..."
- Wait, Ms Muu...

602
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,640
- It's a bit...
- Ms Muu.

603
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
I feel sorry for the champion!

604
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Ms Muu!

605
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,480
The look on the champion's face
wasn't right.

606
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,960
It was so pale!

607
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,000
- You took advantage of it.
- I didn't!

608
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,200
That's how festivals are!

609
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,240
That's what a one-round match is!

610
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,000
When you won the glasses match,
you went, "Yes!"

611
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,840
They filmed you for a long time
after you won,

612
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,360
but the Yakko Scallion one
was over at once.

613
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,720
- Very quickly.
- Of course!

614
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,120
- It was short.
- When I lose,

615
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
I finish it quickly.

616
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,560
Okay, the next segment is this.

617
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,640
- The Quest Hot Spring Club!
- Yay!

618
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,720
1.5 hours from Tokyo,

619
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,560
the Hot Spring Club goes on

620
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,000
a tour in Hiroshima to solve
the problem of lack of exercise.

621
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,240
They've come to Itsukushima Shrine
in Miyajima.

622
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,560
Here we are...

623
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,760
Hiroshima!

624
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,520
The five of them are
the members this time.

625
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,680
It's my first time here.

626
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
- Have you all been here?
- Yes.

627
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,320
Because there's Boat Race Miyajima.

628
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
"Because"?

629
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,360
The tour to solve the problem
of lack of exercise starts now.

630
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,440
They've come to the Seto Inland Sea.

631
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,280
Let's do that, then.

632
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,720
What's that?

633
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,000
A huge surfboard?

634
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,320
It's called Big SUP,

635
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,840
the stand-up paddle board
carries 10 people.

636
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,440
What? It carries 10 people?

637
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,440
You'll go cruising to the island.

638
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,760
Wow, we can go cruising?

639
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,320
- Yay!
- Sounds fun.

640
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,880
The ladies set off.

641
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,640
They'll cruise and admire the view
of Shimanami Kaido

642
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,120
and Tatara Bridge.

643
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,000
Paddling is a full-body exercise,

644
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,160
they can train their bodies
just by standing on the board.

645
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,600
At that time...

646
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,840
Okarina falls.

647
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,720
You idiot!

648
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,320
They'll do one more exercise
on this SUP board.

649
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,200
The three winners
will get a reward.

650
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,800
You can eat Mashi Mashi Oyster.

651
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,920
Mashi Mashi Oyster.

652
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,320
- I want oyster and Okonomiyaki.
- I want that.

653
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,440
I want that.

654
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,160
There are enough people,

655
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
so I'll also join.

656
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,800
What?

657
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,040
Is it okay to punch you?

658
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,800
Machan has done this before.

659
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,120
I'll beat him up.

660
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,560
A real SUP Boxing match.

661
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,280
First, it's Oniyakko versus Ms Muu.

662
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,400
It's been a while!

663
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,880
It's been a long time!

664
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,840
I'll sink you again today!

665
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,600
Right back at you, jerk!

666
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Fight!

667
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,560
It's weak.

668
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,480
It's weak!

669
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,960
They're just playing.

670
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,240
Oniyakko is defeated.

671
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,960
I won!

672
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,800
I'll bring the locals here
next time.

673
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,320
Next, Okarina versus Yoshiko.

674
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,160
Let's fight, Bob SUP!

675
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,480
What?

676
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,120
- Bob SUP!
- What?

677
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
This SUP is your grave!

678
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,840
Don't get Bob Sapp involved
because this is SUP!

679
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,000
Bob SUP!

680
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm not Bob Sapp!

681
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Fight!

682
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,400
It's strong...

683
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,680
Bob SUP is defeated.

684
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,960
Mahiru will fight against Director
Nagata, the world's smallest.

685
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
Finally, the time to kill you
has come!

686
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,840
Try to kill me if you can!

687
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,760
He looks weak.

688
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,520
You always look up to me from below!

689
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,400
He doesn't look down on her.

690
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Fight!

691
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,320
You can do it!

692
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,160
It's a good match!

693
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
Don't let a girl beat you!

694
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,400
- Go!
- Go, go!

695
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Don't be beaten!

696
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,400
Mahiru's crushing victory.

697
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,600
His neck twisted. Is he okay?

698
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,640
The last hook was rather strong.

699
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,800
She still tries to kill him.

700
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,360
The way he fell was like in a manga.

701
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,200
The three winners get a reward.

702
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,960
The Hiroshima speciality,
Okonomiyaki,

703
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,000
is topped with 15 oysters
in this luxurious dish,

704
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,240
Mashi Mashi Oyster.

705
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,480
Nice, it's Hiroshima.

706
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,640
How does it taste?

707
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,560
It's huge!

708
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,760
The oyster is huge.

709
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
It's delicious.

710
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
It's fleshy.

711
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
It really goes with
the green dried seaweed on top.

712
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,320
Delicious!

713
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Ms Murakami's food review
is easy to understand.

714
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,120
Isn't Yoshiko's huge?

715
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,440
Amazing!

716
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,600
As big as my ear.

717
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,600
Like your ear?

718
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,040
The part on the edge
is like oyster mushroom.

719
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,280
Oyster mushroom?

720
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,480
There's no oyster mushroom.

721
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,160
The taste of the top part is light,

722
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,840
but if you eat the oyster
with the sauce,

723
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,160
it makes the flavour rich
and it's absolutely delicious.

724
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,880
- What?
- What?

725
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,240
- It should be us to go, "What?
- Exactly.

726
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,520
You two have the dish.

727
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,320
You can just eat it!

728
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,200
Next, it's the latest sport.

729
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,120
Next, it's the latest sport.

730
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,520
It looks like some kind of sport.

731
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,680
The creator, Mr Motomura
is waiting for them.

732
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,440
It's a kind of sport called SASSEN.

733
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,360
SASSEN.

734
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,960
It's a kind of sport?

735
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,840
We use IT to recreate
a real match between samurai

736
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,200
in the modern world.

737
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,200
It's digital swordplay
with next-generation sensor.

738
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,520
Next-generation sport, SASSEN.

739
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,440
SASSEN.

740
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,520
They'll fight to see
who hits the opponent first.

741
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,440
There is a sensor on the sword,

742
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,320
so it can judge accurately.

743
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,040
Let's use this to have a match.

744
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,640
It sounds fun.

745
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,440
If we have a one-on-one match,
Oniyakko and I will surely lose.

746
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,000
The one who loses most
will do bungee jump.

747
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
What?

748
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
It's strong.

749
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,480
I can't do it.

750
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,560
I can't do it either.

751
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,560
I won't do it.

752
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,880
I'll be blown away at once.

753
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,520
Their reactions don't match.

754
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,560
The two seniors can't fight,

755
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,520
so Okarina, who doesn't mind
doing bungee jump,

756
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,320
and Ganbareruya, who are scared for
real, will fight against each other.

757
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
The rule of the real match is,

758
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,360
they'll hit
the four people running away

759
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,080
as many times as they can
in 15 seconds.

760
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,000
I see.

761
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,320
Machan...

762
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,600
Machan is angry. Machan is angry.

763
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,840
Will we start from Mahiru?

764
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,440
Decide it yourselves.

765
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,560
She's full of fighting spirit.

766
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,600
All of you.

767
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,920
I'll beat you up.

768
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,680
What? Pardon?

769
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,000
Ready...

770
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,280
Start!

771
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,960
Don't grab!

772
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,520
Stop!

773
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,440
Sorry, I went outside.

774
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,400
Okarina grabbed me!

775
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,320
- You grabbed her, Oka?
- I did.

776
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,680
She kept hitting me.

777
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
Okarina grabbed me!

778
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,680
Because you kept hitting me.

779
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,560
No one said we can't grab.

780
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,920
She grabbed me,
so I lost those counts.

781
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,520
She grabbed me.

782
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,000
I grabbed you to do that.

783
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,400
Fight fair and square!

784
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
Grabbing you is fair and square.

785
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,040
You shouldn't grab!

786
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,520
I'm going to grab you
the whole time you hit!

787
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,040
Do that, then. I'll hit you even so.

788
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,520
I like her face just now!

789
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,880
- She's furious.
- Wait... Calm down.

790
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,400
It's like a fight between siblings.

791
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
Next, it's Okarina's turn.

792
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,240
Ready...

793
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,440
Start.

794
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,400
Bring it on.

795
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,000
What?

796
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,280
It has become a different sport!

797
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,400
Stop!

798
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,240
They were having a fight.

799
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,600
What sport is this?

800
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,160
It looked like judo
when you locked arms.

801
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,840
I grabbed you,
because you grabbed me.

802
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,760
You grabbed me, so I did it back.

803
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,120
But I hit you 18 times.

804
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,920
You only hit me 18 times.

805
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,120
Yoshiko is going to do it.

806
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,680
Is this sport like this?

807
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,200
The last one is Yoshiko.

808
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,320
Ready...

809
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
Start.

810
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,800
It's brutal.

811
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,240
It hurts!

812
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,760
It's dangerous...

813
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,320
Yoshiko, hang in there.

814
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,680
Stop!

815
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,560
Oh, no, she fell!

816
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,760
Yoshiko ranks the lowest,
so she will do bungee jump.

817
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
- Do it for me.
- There's no way I can.

818
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,240
No matter what happens,
this is something I can't do.

819
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,840
- Please!
- Absolutely not.

820
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
They've come to the neighbouring
prefecture, Okayama,

821
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,600
to Washuzan Highland.

822
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,400
The facility is built on a mountain.

823
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,320
I see.

824
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,280
She'll feel like she jumps down
from an altitude of 170 metres.

825
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,440
In addition, there is a blast
blowing up there.

826
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,040
I have to do it.

827
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,800
I have to do it.

828
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,360
Can Yoshiko jump?

829
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,800
I have to jump, right?

830
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,840
I have to jump!

831
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,880
Do my best!

832
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,320
I can do it! I can do it!
I can do it!

833
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,760
- She always says it in the bath.
- What?

834
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,480
- I have to do it.
- "You can do it, Yoshiko!"

835
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,600
- She says it on her own.
- Even in the bath?

836
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,440
Courage, guts!

837
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,520
- I won't be beaten.
- You can do it!

838
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,640
I won't be beaten!

839
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,520
She jumped!

840
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,960
I won't be beaten!
I won't be beaten!

841
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,800
I won't be beaten!

842
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,200
I won! I won!

843
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,920
She's basking in her sense
of achievement,

844
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,760
but there is a big problem.

845
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,160
Yoshiko, did you film
with the GoPro?

846
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,160
She looks like a rhinoceros beetle.

847
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,640
You look like a rhinoceros beetle.

848
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,720
Did it film your face?

849
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
- I won't be beaten!
- When we check...

850
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I want to see her face.

851
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
Her face went out of frame
at the best part.

852
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh, give me a break!

853
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,280
There are cameras that function
properly nowadays!

854
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
Let's climb a mountain next.

855
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,200
The mountain is easy to climb.

856
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,240
You say it's easy, but it has never
been easy on this show.

857
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,560
Is this okay?

858
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,200
You're wearing a funny hat.

859
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,400
I'm only wearing
what I was provided.

860
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
They start climbing the mountain.

861
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,440
- I'm Sumiko Nishioka.
- What?

862
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,280
I'm Barbie-ko Barbie-oka.

863
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Someone has come to tell
everyone I worked with

864
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,840
at The Quest that she got married.

865
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
Who is she?

866
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,720
It's me!

867
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,400
It's what her senior did.

868
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,720
Barbie announced her marriage
with an ordinary man in April, 2021.

869
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,240
Wow, good for you!

870
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,920
- Well...
- Congratulations...

871
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,720
I must thank everyone
at The Quest.

872
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,200
- What?
- Why?

873
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,000
My Achilles tendon.

874
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,160
It happened in June, 2019,

875
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,720
at the banquet
of the One Art Training Camp.

876
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,920
"June 2019,
at One Art Training Camp"

877
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,920
Her Achilles tendon
tore at this moment.

878
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,680
But her boyfriend moved in with her
to look after her,

879
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,680
they got closer at once
and finally got married.

880
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,120
Achilles marriage.

881
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,560
She calls it Achilles marriage.

882
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,720
It's Achilles marriage.

883
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,200
Barbie joins them and they start
climbing the mountain again.

884
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,360
After climbing 30 minutes...

885
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,000
They see a scenery
that resembles the Alps.

886
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,920
I think it's okay to climb up!

887
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,280
This is a scenic place
that only those in the know, know,

888
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,720
Mount Kurotaki.

889
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,520
It's 266 metres above the sea,
but has a view like this.

890
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
In front of their eyes,

891
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,560
it's a stunning scenery of the whole
Seto Inland Sea and Shikoku.

892
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
This photo will surely look cool.

893
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,680
Yes, it's a good photo.

894
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,520
It looks like
we're at an amazing place.

895
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,880
It's a vast place--

896
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,680
- What? What, Yoshiko?
- What are you doing?

897
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
Are you scared?

898
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
What's the matter?

899
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,760
It's dangerous. What are you doing?

900
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,960
No...

901
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
No... Ms Muu should be at the front.

902
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
It's okay, it's still okay.

903
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,080
- I'll hold you together.
- It's scary!

904
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,960
Next, they came to Kure Port.

905
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,960
There are huge destroyers
and submarines lining up,

906
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,680
it's the main base of the Japan
Maritime Self-Defence Force.

907
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,480
This time, you'll receive

908
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,960
a special training by the Japan
Maritime Self-Defence Force.

909
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
What?

910
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,600
I heard the self-defence force's
training is the harshest.

911
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,480
I didn't come here for that.

912
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,560
Ms Barbie, you're a crucial member.

913
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,840
This is the Submarine Training
Centre's Commander Mekada.

914
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,880
Almost every one
of the submarine crew

915
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,200
was trained at
the Submarine Training Centre.

916
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,320
You're going to experience
that today.

917
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,200
You'll know about the ship,

918
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,600
establish teamwork,

919
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,760
and train your mind and body.

920
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,200
This will be the training.

921
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,320
Any weight limit?

922
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,360
- No, don't worry.
- Don't worry?

923
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Now, their training begins.

924
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,520
- Barbie, yours...
- It's pretty.

925
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,680
- I've got a heart shape.
- So cute!

926
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,320
Oh, jeez.

927
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,720
You've gotten changed. Attention!

928
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,120
It starts suddenly.

929
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,200
This time, Instructor Miyazaki
will train the ladies.

930
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,120
When you reply, say yes,

931
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,680
or my pleasure. That's all.

932
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,880
"My pleasure"?

933
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,800
When do we say "my pleasure"?

934
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,640
When you're made to do
something tough,

935
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,600
and you don't want to do it,
say, "My pleasure!"

936
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,560
What?

937
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
It's the opposite of "no"?

938
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,480
Even in the Japan Maritime
Self-Defence Force,

939
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,160
only the selected members
can get in a submarine.

940
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,040
And the Submarine Training Centre
here

941
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,560
is the school where all submarine
crew members are trained.

942
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,640
They'll finally start learning.

943
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,840
It's amazing!

944
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,160
We've entered a place
that's very important.

945
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,160
This is the submarine's
controlling room.

946
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,160
The submarine's centre gives
commands and controls the vessel.

947
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,200
This is a Oyashio-class submarine's

948
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,640
underwater control training device.

949
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,840
The actual length
of the whole Oyashio is 82 metres,

950
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,960
the controlling room is at this part
of the huge vessel.

951
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,160
First of all, how does a submarine
surface or sink?

952
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,000
Actually, a submarine's hull
has two components.

953
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,000
The wall is built like a huge tank.

954
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,680
By letting seawater into the tank,

955
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,720
it loses its buoyancy
and it can sink.

956
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,840
I see.

957
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,200
When it has to float, seawater is
pushed out the tank by air pressure

958
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,480
to gain buoyancy.

959
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,800
Please pull. It moved, right?

960
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,960
Something is moving!

961
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
This resembles the state
of sudden surfacing.

962
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,760
How can you stand?

963
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,480
We're like Michael Jackson.

964
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,480
When a submarine is underwater,

965
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,600
there's something very dangerous.

966
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,320
It is flooding.

967
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,560
It's scary...

968
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,680
The submarine's machine room
is recreated here,

969
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,680
trainings to fight floods can be
done at this special facility.

970
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,520
Wow, it's scary.

971
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,240
Isn't this bad?

972
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,600
The crew members will show us.

973
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,400
A submarine is affected
by water pressure all the time,

974
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,240
erosion caused by impact
and seawater will cause flooding.

975
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,800
"Teamwork"

976
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,480
It's important for a team to work
together to stop the spraying water.

977
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,440
Ready, go!

978
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,560
Oh, no!

979
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,560
- There's a lot of water!
- Amazing.

980
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,680
A maximum of 200 tonnes of water
is released at one time.

981
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,560
The members receive
realistic training every day.

982
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,120
Amazing!

983
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,680
We can't do it.

984
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
I was speechless.

985
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,200
First, the basics.

986
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,400
Get used to water.

987
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,000
Push the water back
when the whistle is blown,

988
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,600
block the hole by hand.

989
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,120
It's difficult.

990
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,160
They stop it by hand.

991
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,600
When the whistle is blown again,

992
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,320
return to the original position.

993
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,680
Everything is normal.

994
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,880
Yoshiko is deployed.

995
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,840
Please set the output at maximum!

996
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,040
The output is raised 20 percent.

997
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,080
Can she do it?

998
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,400
Yoshiko uses her face
to confront it.

999
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,120
It's scary!

1000
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
It must hurt...

1001
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,440
She managed to do it.

1002
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,600
Everything is normal!

1003
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Everything is normal!

1004
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,480
No, it isn't!

1005
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,840
Now, it's time
for practical training.

1006
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,800
They'll use
these three kinds of tools.

1007
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,600
Use this board patch
for a large crack.

1008
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Hook the T-shape part in the crack
to stabilise it.

1009
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,040
They are emergency bands,

1010
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,720
they're put over the pipes
to stop the water.

1011
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,200
This is a wooden plug.

1012
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,960
It's put into the hole
and hammered in with a hammer.

1013
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,760
Can they stop the water spraying
from everywhere?

1014
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,040
- You can do it!
- Go!

1015
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,280
The whole team is deployed.

1016
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,680
Let's go.

1017
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,080
First, Mahiru uses her body to block
the strongest spray.

1018
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,240
They'll use a board patch for this.

1019
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,320
They go near the crack
when Mahiru is stopping the water.

1020
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,520
They match the timing
and put the patch in,

1021
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,040
and press it down at once.

1022
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,960
Wait.

1023
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,080
Is it okay?

1024
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,760
Good.

1025
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,360
Ready, push!

1026
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,840
- It's in!
- It's in?

1027
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,880
They stopped one place first.

1028
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,120
On the other hand,
they'll stop the pipe's leak.

1029
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,240
Bands with different widths
are prepared to match

1030
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,640
pipes of various widths.

1031
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,920
Push it down harder!

1032
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,360
Lastly, Mahiru will hammer
the wooden plug in.

1033
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,600
You can do it!

1034
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,640
- It's difficult.
- Don't be beaten!

1035
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,880
Don't be beaten, Machan!

1036
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,800
You can do it!

1037
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,120
Don't be beaten!

1038
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,800
You can do it!

1039
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,040
You can do it!

1040
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,760
Finally, she successfully
stopped the water.

1041
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,760
Everyone, salute!

1042
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,760
Everything is normal!

1043
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,920
It was amazing.

1044
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,240
I was really impressed
by the good work.

1045
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,280
I thought we must improve too.

1046
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,320
- My pleasure.
- Okay.

1047
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,960
It's what you say
when you mean "no."

1048
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,160
That's all for the tour to solve
the problem of lack of exercise.

1049
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,960
Barbie, congratulations
on your marriage.

1050
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,720
Congratulations!

1051
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,200
After Imoto.

1052
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,240
We were a duo after all.
I'm so happy.

1053
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,880
Your Achilles tendon started it?

1054
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,160
Yes, that's right.
Because that happened,

1055
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,360
we got much closer.

1056
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,400
He isn't the impersonator, right?

1057
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,440
- Mr Hiromi Go's...
- Yes, I said that started it,

1058
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,200
some people assumed I got married
to the actor who played Mr Go.

1059
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,320
"Hiromi Go's impersonator"

1060
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,720
It isn't him.

1061
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,560
It isn't that guy?

1062
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,760
I thought you did!

1063
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,640
Some people think she did, right?

1064
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,760
Yeah.
