1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,680
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,240
Today's first segment
is a special project.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
"Special"?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,880
New Degawa Girls
challenge themselves

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,200
in The Quest's compulsory subject.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,800
One day, we summoned Degawa.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,000
What is it this time?

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,440
You'll do a dolphin show this time.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Didn't Madame Dewi and I perform
in a dolphin show before?

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,800
Eight years ago at Aqua World Oarai,

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,800
Degawa and Madame did a wonderful
performance in a dolphin show.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,320
It was amazing.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,680
I'll never forget that
in the actual performance,

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,720
the dolphin bit Madame.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,440
Two or three days after filming,

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,280
she called me on my mobile

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,280
and went, "Tetsuro,
I'm going to sue The Quest!"

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,440
"I'm going to sue Nippon TV!"

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
She was furious when she called me.

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,560
I thought, "Why me?"

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,080
Many members of The Quest
had performed

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,600
in our compulsory subject,
dolphin show,

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,800
and our new Degawa Girls,
Yumeppe and Yokota

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,680
will do it together with Degawa.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,000
The girls will have a harsh lesson.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,880
Dolphin shows are rather tough.

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,200
They must become friends
with the dolphins first.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,960
Madame and I became real friends
with the dolphins.

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,160
The girls will really be friends...

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,600
Wait, she was bitten
after becoming its friend?

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,120
What is the dolphin show
going to be like?

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,680
Welcome to The Quest.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,400
Today, it's New Degawa Girls
Perform in A Dolphin Show,

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,960
and Asako Ito's Mystery Tour.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
Wasshoi!

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
"Morisanchu"

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
Hello...

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
Hello!

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,280
Hi, everyone!

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
"Yumena Yanai"

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,280
"Mayuu Yokota"

42
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,720
This time, our new Degawa Girls,
Yumeppe and Yokota,

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,640
did The Quest's compulsory subject.

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,760
- Yes.
- A dolphin show.

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,760
They hadn't tried it before,
so it would be tough.

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,160
It wasn't the dolphin show
I imagined.

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,040
Many things were difficult,

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,640
but I enjoyed it at the end.

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,360
Different from the dolphin show
you thought?

50
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,280
Is that possible?

51
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,040
What do you two think about
how Tet-chan handled the dolphins?

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,200
Well...

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,920
- What?
- In the actual performance!

54
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,880
You'll be surprised.

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,360
"Yanai and Yokota
tries for the first time"

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,960
"Compulsory subject in The Quest"

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
You must be curious.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
Start!

59
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
One, two...

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
"Mystery Tour in Kinki"

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Three hours by car on Tomei
Expressway and surface streets,

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,000
New Degawa Girls
challenge themselves

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,040
in The Quest's compulsory subject.

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,360
Perform in a Dolphin Show
in Shizuoka.

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
We've come to...

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,560
Numazu!

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,720
It rained the moment we shouted.
It startled me.

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,120
Here at Osezaki coast,

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
you can see the famous Mount Fuji
on a sunny day,

70
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
and the view is stunning.

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,800
Hey, wait a minute.

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,320
What? The three of us?
What's going on?

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,240
That means they went filming
in another time?

74
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,960
I had no idea at all.

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,480
It really makes me feel that we,
the old girls, are unnecessary.

76
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,040
And we did our own makeup
and we're in our own outfits.

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
Isn't this wrong?

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,000
This time,
commentary by the old girls

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,880
will be added at the key points.

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,480
The three old girls
aren't here today,

81
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,640
so you can relax, right?

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,320
I'd like to see
our seniors' example.

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
For me, it's easier to talk
if they aren't here.

84
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,760
You say it so clearly
that it's refreshing.

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,720
Did you watch the dolphin show
Madame and I performed in?

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,960
I heard about it.

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you mind?

88
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,760
These two girls claimed they've been
watching our show

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,080
and they're huge fans,

90
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,280
but I have doubts.

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
I do watch it.

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,080
- Yokota?
- I'll watch it.

93
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,800
I watch it. I watch it.

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
This is the stage
they'll perform on.

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,680
Izu Mito Sea Paradise.

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Suruga Bay and Mount Fuji
are visible in this aquarium.

97
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Actually, in 1930,

98
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,120
it became the first in the world
to have successfully bred a dolphin,

99
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,880
and it's an old aquarium
that is most established.

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Now, let's have a look
at the technique they'll master.

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,520
This is the technique.

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,320
Two dolphins push a person up
on their soles in the move.

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
Lift.

104
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Wow, this move.

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,080
Impressive!

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
It's a huge jump that goes
over three metres high.

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
They'll master this difficult move
in four days.

108
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,720
Their teacher is...

109
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
Nice to meet you.

110
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,080
Mr Yamada, who has been
a trainer for seven years.

111
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,800
The thing I'm most worried about
is the jump.

112
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,400
- Two dolphins do it together.
- Yes.

113
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,600
When Madame and I did it,
it was one.

114
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,560
If it's two, isn't it going to be
much more difficult?

115
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
To be honest,
I think it is very difficult.

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
But if it's successful,

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,520
- it's very high and it looks cool.
- It's scary.

118
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Also, the difficult part
of this mission

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
is that instead of a pool,

120
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,280
the stage is the sea, which is
easily affected by the weather.

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,920
Also, Izu Mito Sea Paradise

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
has dolphin shows every day
throughout the year.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,720
Because of the burden
on the dolphins,

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,840
they can't practise for a long time.

125
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,680
Let me introduce you to the two
dolphins who will be performing.

126
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,240
The one on the right is Sudachi,

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
the one on the left is Kabosu.

128
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
They're common bottlenose dolphins,
Sudachi and Kabosu.

129
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,840
They're both female,
but Kabosu is more shy.

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,880
Sudachi and Kabosu.

131
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,000
- Wow, they're greeting us.
- So cool.

132
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,560
First, they'll shake hands.

133
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,160
If they hate you now,
it'll be difficult later.

134
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Okay.

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,240
Here they are.

136
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
Go shake their hands.

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,240
Why did you talk a bit like Madame?

138
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
Was that Madame?

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,320
No.

140
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
Here.

141
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,040
Yokota also did it successfully.

142
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,760
- Hurray!
- Wonderful.

143
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,080
But Yumeppe...

144
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
Here.

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Amazing!

146
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,280
Oh, she hates you.

147
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,200
She couldn't make contact
with Kabosu.

148
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
That's right.

149
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,560
The dolphins will surely feel it
if you let them know how you feel.

150
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,760
He's full of confidence
after doing it once.

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,720
He talked like it's his job,

152
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
but he had only done it once.

153
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,800
- He only does it well at first.
- That's true.

154
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,640
First, the abilities of each of them
are checked in a pool.

155
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,800
First, it's swimming.

156
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,920
To perform with dolphins,

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
they don't flutter kick
to avoid scaring the dolphins,

158
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,280
and they must swim straight
with their arms only.

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Don't make so much sound
in the water.

160
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
Be quiet, be quiet.

161
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Regarding Degawa's swim,
the teacher...

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
makes this face.

163
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
He became The Thinker.

164
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,440
To make matters worse...

165
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,760
He can't climb up.

166
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Degawa can't climb up by himself.

167
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,280
- Yumeppe, please...
- Yes?

168
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm scared.

169
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,240
Why are you scared?

170
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm asking you to pull me up.

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
Are you going to do your usual?

172
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
This isn't my usual.

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm just asking you to pull me up.

174
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,200
Degawa fully intended
to pull her down.

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,520
Ready, go.

176
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
You can't beat me.

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
- She's strong.
- You can't beat me.

178
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,400
This old man
can't beat a 20-year-old anymore.

179
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
You can't beat her.

180
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,160
She's strong.

181
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
You're really strong.

182
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,720
The one who performed
the best among the three is...

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,280
Yokota did it the best.

184
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,120
Hurray!

185
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,960
Teacher, how was it different?

186
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Her body was very straight.

187
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,680
She swam with her body straight,
that made it the best.

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Next, it's diving.

189
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,240
I've never dived.

190
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,880
- In your whole life?
- Yeah.

191
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,840
Yumeppe, you too?

192
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,800
I used to dive into rivers.

193
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,560
Wow, you grew up in the wild.

194
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,240
How skilled is she?

195
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,160
It's rather good.

196
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,280
Yokota dives for the first time
in her life.

197
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,160
It looked clumsy,
but the teacher thinks...

198
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,080
Well done.

199
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,520
The teacher didn't use much power.

200
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
When the teacher jumps,

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,560
the water only splashes a little.

202
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,840
I'll just run there
and jump like that.

203
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm scared.

204
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,160
- Here I go.
- Pull your chin back.

205
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,480
Okay, please dive.

206
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,480
It looks painful.

207
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,280
It hurts somewhere so low?

208
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,880
He's pulled out of the water
every single time.

209
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,120
Okay.

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,160
She's rather strong
if she can pull me up.

211
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,160
Also, they'll stay still
in the water.

212
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,200
When the dolphins push you up,

213
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
you have to stand straight,

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
push your legs up in front,

215
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
and keep them at this position.

216
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,360
When it's one dolphin, they can just
stand straight and wait,

217
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,840
but there are two this time,
so they need to spread their legs.

218
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,400
Good! Good!

219
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,920
But...

220
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,960
Wait, this is...

221
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,200
This posture is rather difficult
for a plump old guy.

222
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,400
The two young girls,
on the other hand...

223
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,160
Why is it so stable?

224
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,840
They did it easily.

225
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,000
Well done.

226
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,720
That face pisses me off.

227
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,120
Like, "I'm pretty, am I not?"

228
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,680
I'm not thinking that!

229
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
Or you wouldn't be able
to make that face!

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

231
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,280
Mr Degawa actually thinks
she's pretty.

232
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,720
Yes, for sure.

233
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,040
He wouldn't say it
if he didn't think she was cute.

234
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
Exactly...

235
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,680
Has he ever said that to you?

236
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
- No, no.
- No, right?

237
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,040
He doesn't think we're cute?

238
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
He pisses me off.

239
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,680
Day two of filming. They'll practise
with the dolphins today.

240
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,040
To learn how to lift,

241
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
the performer must get the dolphins
to push the soles of their feet.

242
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,000
Impressive.

243
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,840
Yumeppe goes first.

244
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,520
- So cool.
- Amazing!

245
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,920
It bent a little, but
it's successful on the first try.

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,760
Impressive! It's good.

247
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,680
Yokota is next.

248
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,280
Lie down... Well done!

249
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,720
She also does it successfully
on her first try.

250
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,120
People naturally tense up,

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,960
but if you can relax
right from the beginning,

252
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,960
and do it by feeling,
then you really have potential.

253
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
Hurray! I'm happy.

254
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
Maybe she is really cut out
to perform in a dolphin show.

255
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,560
Degawa is the last one.

256
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,200
What's the matter?

257
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,040
They don't come at all.

258
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
Why?

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Really, why?

260
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,160
In that case, I'll join you.

261
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,920
We'll make the dolphins
get used to you first.

262
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
The teacher teaches him
step by step, and finally...

263
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,680
Oh, one pushes me.

264
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,720
That's good. Perfect.

265
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,560
It isn't perfect at all.

266
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,120
They didn't come near
at all earlier,

267
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,840
but now, one pushed your foot.
It's a great progress.

268
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,880
It started raining,

269
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,240
but they have many tasks to tackle,
so their practise continues.

270
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,280
Whether the rain pours
or a typhoon comes,

271
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
we have no time.

272
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
We have to do it.

273
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,960
This time, they'll practise Slider.
The dolphins will push them

274
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,600
when they're facing the front.

275
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
It's fast!

276
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,040
- Yokota, will you try Slider once?
- Yes.

277
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,000
If Yokota is next to try this,

278
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,280
it probably means
Yokota does it better.

279
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,920
Why are you provoking
her competitive mind?

280
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,680
I mean, it should be
Yumeppe's turn now.

281
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,240
If he changed that suddenly...

282
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,520
Because of the uncalled-for remark
Degawa made,

283
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
the atmosphere gets a bit tense.

284
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,280
Don't intentionally say things
that cause a falling-out.

285
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,680
- Really!
- Right?

286
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,840
He's a pro at making people quarrel.

287
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
He is, indeed!

288
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,600
We used to be close friends.

289
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,400
"Close friends"
doesn't sound right either.

290
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,440
Somehow, gradually...

291
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,560
In the middle of that, Yokota...

292
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,080
succeeded to do a Slider right away.

293
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,800
Hurray! I did it!

294
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,520
I think Mayuu really has potential.

295
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Yumeppe?

296
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,560
It made me really fired up

297
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,120
- to do it successfully.
- I did it on purpose.

298
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,000
Can she do it?

299
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Good, keep your body straight
and wait...

300
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,360
You're sliding.

301
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
Amazing!

302
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Yumeppe succeeds.

303
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,600
Also...

304
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,840
Let go.

305
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,400
She even did a turn,
which hasn't been taught.

306
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,920
That's so impressive.

307
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,880
Wow, she's back.

308
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,240
Okay, I'll go now.

309
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,520
Please stay calm.

310
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,960
"Stay calm."

311
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,000
That's cool.

312
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,560
Come...

313
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,160
Relax, relax.

314
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
Hey, you stopped.

315
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,280
- Okay, come back.
- Are you kidding me?

316
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
Why?

317
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Why don't the dolphins
go near Degawa?

318
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,720
Compared to the girls,

319
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
the way he dived was careless,

320
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,680
and he was unstable underwater.

321
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,000
- Teacher.
- Yes?

322
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,720
Starting tomorrow,
please focus on me.

323
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,640
- I'm in a bit of trouble.
- Yeah.

324
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,640
At the same time, Yumeppe and Yokota
finally start practising the Lift.

325
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,680
Teacher, we're in separate classes.

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,840
It's like we're
in different classes now.

327
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,560
We'll complete
one performance together.

328
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,200
- We're in the same class.
- Yes.

329
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,960
Day three of practise.

330
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,840
To become closer to the dolphins,

331
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,520
they start from looking after them.

332
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,080
Dolphins are as clever as humans,

333
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,560
they must look after the dolphins to
build a mutual-trust relationship,

334
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,760
or the dolphins
won't listen to them.

335
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,240
The girls in the Advanced Class
will practise the bold move, Lift.

336
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
After touching the dolphins,

337
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
spread the legs a little underwater,

338
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
stay still and wait,

339
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,680
the two dolphins
will push them up strongly.

340
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,440
But there are waves in the sea,

341
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,320
it's difficult to keep the body
still and wait.

342
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
It's okay, it's okay.

343
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,920
Or the dolphins can't push
when they go towards their feet.

344
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,680
Even if the dolphins can push well,

345
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,720
the force is rather strong,

346
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,240
so their knees will buckle
if they aren't used to it.

347
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,200
That's impressive...!

348
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,120
I felt like I jumped very high.

349
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,760
But you only jumped up this much.

350
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
You were startled
the moment you jumped,

351
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
and you backed away.

352
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,640
Your legs went to the front

353
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
and you fell down with your bottom
like you're sitting.

354
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,720
If you don't move back
and keep your legs straight,

355
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,640
you would've jumped higher.

356
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,600
I see.

357
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,720
Based on that, Yumeppe...

358
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
Amazing!

359
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,920
Instead of jumping up,
she was thrown to the front.

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
I see.

361
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,200
To improve, they'll keep practising
and get used to the height.

362
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,680
I still pull my behind to the back.

363
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,800
On the other hand, the dolphins
finally push Degawa's feet.

364
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,720
Okay, go left!

365
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,720
He's in another class.

366
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
That's the right side!

367
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Amazing!

368
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,120
It's fast!

369
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
They're in two different classes.

370
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,320
- Hurray.
- Amazing!

371
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,720
And then...

372
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,480
Oh, it came out.

373
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh, my contact lens came off.

374
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,280
We happened to film how Degawa
puts on his contact lens,

375
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,760
let's have a look.

376
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,360
This one...

377
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
Is it the other way round?
Is it okay?

378
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,400
- Darn it.
- I understand.

379
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,920
It doesn't go in if I don't look.

380
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
It came out.

381
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,760
It's the first time I see someone
spend so long to wear contact lens.

382
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

383
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,240
It goes in quickly when it does.

384
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,840
It won't go in
if you don't open your eye wider.

385
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,120
Is it in?

386
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Is it in? It's in, right?

387
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,840
Is it in?

388
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,760
Is it in? It's in, right?

389
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
It's in?

390
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,040
The dolphins have also lost
their concentration,

391
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,600
so let's get psyched
and do it in one go.

392
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,320
He gets psyched
and goes in the water, but...

393
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
My contact lens came off again.

394
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,880
Please come up, then.

395
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
Why?

396
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,640
It ends as a failure.

397
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,440
If it comes off every time I dive,

398
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,280
it shouldn't be called one day.

399
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,360
It's one chance. One chance.

400
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,360
It costs me so much.

401
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,880
Contact lenses for one-day use
costs 100 yen, right?

402
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,480
I think you should worry more about
the dolphins not coming.

403
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,560
This is bad.

404
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,720
Day four of practise.

405
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,160
They'll practise with these today.

406
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,240
It's so cool!

407
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,080
Flyboard, an activity that uses
hydraulic pressure to stay midair.

408
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,840
It's perfect for getting used

409
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,640
to the power of the dolphins' push
and the height of the jump.

410
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,360
The young girls master it
in no time.

411
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,280
- That's impressive!
- Impressive.

412
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
I did it!

413
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh, she went up!

414
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,280
Impressive!

415
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
She's waving!

416
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,200
The problem is this man.

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
He generally doesn't do
this sort of activities well,

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
and they're shelved many times,

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
but our Advisor this time
is totally different.

420
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,720
"1st TRY"

421
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,160
This is the real first attempt.

422
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,000
Amazing!

423
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
Amazing!

424
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,720
So cool!

425
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,640
He does it successfully in one try.

426
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,200
Why?

427
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,000
He hasn't practised,

428
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,720
if he can do it so well, we can
expect him to do the Dolphin Lift.

429
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,880
But...

430
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,800
Let's go.

431
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,360
It wasn't that easy.

432
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,920
But he can do it,
they're in the same class now.

433
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm scared!

434
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,640
- Your contact lens fell out.
- What?

435
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
Your contact lens fell out.

436
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,920
I thought you were playing dumb.

437
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
This is my tear.

438
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,720
The two young girls
are struggling too.

439
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,880
It's different, after all.
They're done in different ways.

440
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,360
I wonder why my behind falls first.

441
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,600
That's how difficult a Lift
by two dolphins is.

442
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
She went higher, though,

443
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,880
the last one looked stupid.

444
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
I can't do anything
if water enters my nose.

445
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I see. Do that when you practise,
but don't do it in the performance.

446
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,400
In the end, they couldn't learn it
in four days.

447
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,880
The training camp ends for now.

448
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,200
After that, they go to the aquarium
whenever they have time.

449
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,280
There are techniques besides jumping
they need to practise after all.

450
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,240
They'll stay still upside-down,
underwater.

451
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,600
- Cool.
- Impressive.

452
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
This is the result
of intense training.

453
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,720
Impressive.

454
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,440
So cool.

455
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,600
Do your best.

456
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm in real trouble.

457
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,280
I'm saying "this is bad"
from the bottom of my heart.

458
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,320
I say "this is bad" on TV
all the time,

459
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,640
but there were times
I didn't think it was that bad.

460
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,560
Is that so?

461
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,480
But until the last moment...

462
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm going to trust
Sudachi and Kabosu.

463
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,600
It's already a claim
of his dependence on the dolphins.

464
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,440
On the other hand,
Yumeppe and Yokota

465
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,800
each received intense training
for four days.

466
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
Who? Who? They also practised alone?

467
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,600
Yokota and Yumeppe did.

468
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,160
They couldn't do the techniques
during filming,

469
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,760
but they need to finish it.
Would you go alone?

470
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
- Sure.
- Of course I will.

471
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,880
It's filmed, right?
I'll go if you film me.

472
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,000
We'll go if they film us, right?

473
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
- You'll film, right?
- It's filming.

474
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
I'll be hesitant if you tell me
to just practise alone,

475
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,680
but I'll totally go if you film me.

476
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,040
Finally, it's the actual
performance.

477
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,720
"Actual Dolphin Show"

478
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
On the day
of the actual performance...

479
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,040
Finally, it's the day
of the actual performance.

480
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,280
What do you say, Yokota?

481
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,320
I'll do it.

482
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,920
Oh, you can do it?

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,240
And you, Yumeppe?

484
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm very worried,

485
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,520
but if I'm very nervous,
the dolphins can sense it,

486
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,600
so the best thing to do is to relax.

487
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,320
Okay, let's show them the power
of our new Degawa Girls.

488
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

489
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,920
Yumeppe, say your Ondo.

490
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,560
- My Ondo?
- That's right.

491
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
Choose one you like.

492
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,400
Yumeppe does her best.

493
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
No...

494
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Not Yumeppe.

495
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,280
The three of us will work together
and do our best!

496
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,240
What "Yumeppe does her best"?

497
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
But you told me to say my Ondo.

498
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay, do it, Yokota.

499
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,920
What is "Ondo"?

500
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,160
Wait...

501
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,800
This is incredible!

502
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,560
The one that you do this?

503
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,680
No, that's Bon Dance.

504
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,880
Finally, they'll show the result
of their practise this summer.

505
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
Do your best!

506
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Let's do it.

507
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,240
A dolphin show performed by
Degawa and the new Degawa Girls

508
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,680
starts now.

509
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,760
Hello, viewers.
Now, Tetsuro Degawa and...

510
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,440
the new Degawa Girls will perform.

511
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Please watch our dolphin show!

512
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,960
It's show time!

513
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,360
- Do your best.
- Do your best.

514
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,920
Okay!

515
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,960
First, they will work together
in Tail Flipping.

516
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
The dolphins
first raise their tails,

517
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
the three of them
will match their movement.

518
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,840
Ready, go!

519
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
- Yes!
- What?

520
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,480
Only Degawa's is sloppy.

521
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Now, Yokota will perform.

522
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Okay, let's do it.

523
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,600
First, it's the Slider.

524
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,080
She is smiling,

525
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,680
but she is determined
to do this project.

526
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,320
She had been shedding
tears of frustration

527
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,480
when she practised on her own.

528
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm angry at myself.

529
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,120
Now is the time
to show people the result.

530
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,920
Wow, it's good!

531
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,920
Yokota's performance is successful.

532
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
She goes around the stage
in a big circle.

533
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,160
She performed well
as the first performer.

534
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,840
Next, she will ride
on a dolphin's back.

535
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
Impressive!

536
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
This is also successful.

537
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,800
Amazing. She's waving.

538
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,080
Wow, you're doing it.

539
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
Amazing!

540
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,400
I did it!

541
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,560
Lastly,
it's the most difficult Lift.

542
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,840
Has she overcome her fear
of heights?

543
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
- Let's see!
- You can do it.

544
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,520
Do your best.

545
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,120
Beautiful!

546
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
She even made a gesture
and did it successfully.

547
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,960
She fell straight down beautifully.

548
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,480
It's beautiful!

549
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,280
Well done, Yokota!
It was successful.

550
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,880
How was it, Teacher?

551
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
I think it was perfect.

552
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,160
Her smile was the best.

553
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,040
- I see, when she jumped.
- That's right.

554
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,440
It was brilliant.

555
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,280
I feel relieved.

556
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,240
Right?

557
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,040
What?

558
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
What?

559
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
What?

560
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
"An insensitive old man"

561
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Don't do that, it's nasty.

562
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,120
- This old guy is awful.
- Exactly!

563
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,000
I know how Yokota felt
and I was touched.

564
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,960
What's wrong with that guy?

565
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,320
- Did you get emotional?
- Yes.

566
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,440
Yes. Yokota came to practise alone
on another day.

567
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,760
I see.

568
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Okay.

569
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,560
- Next, it's Yumeppe's turn.
- Do your best.

570
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,880
After Yokota's success,
she can't perform worse.

571
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
How will she do?

572
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,880
That's right...

573
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,840
Wow, the body above her waist
is above the water.

574
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,200
It's a dynamic Slider.

575
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,120
Good! Good!

576
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,880
Next, it's the Ride.

577
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,480
Hold out...

578
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,560
- Good!
- She's holding out!

579
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,560
She's swaying,
but managed to do it successfully.

580
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,560
Beautiful!

581
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,560
Amazing!

582
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,000
She held out.

583
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
She swayed a bit halfway.

584
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,560
Lastly, it's the Lift.

585
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,040
Will she be able to jump beautifully
without pressing her nose?

586
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,680
Beautiful!

587
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Yumeppe did a big, beautiful jump.

588
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,240
- Beautiful!
- Wow, beautiful!

589
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,680
- Beautiful!
- It was fantastic!

590
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,960
Yokota passed it to Yumeppe,

591
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
Yumeppe passed it to me.

592
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,160
Lastly, it's the anchor.

593
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,600
This is bad.

594
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,600
- Degawa is the last performer.
- He looks determined.

595
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,760
I haven't seen
your successful performance,

596
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,440
so please show me you can do it.

597
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,120
Okay, challenge accepted.

598
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
What is it?

599
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,280
First, it's the Slider.

600
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,920
Will the dolphins push him?

601
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,920
Relax!

602
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,480
Are they here? They are.

603
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,440
The dolphins pushed him!

604
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,200
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"

605
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,640
It's a rather small circle,
but he managed to do it.

606
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,360
So small!

607
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,240
I did go in a circle.

608
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,400
And the Ride, which he hasn't done
successfully before.

609
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,360
Ride.

610
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,640
Make it in the actual performance.

611
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
Ride on the dolphin.

612
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,800
You can do it!

613
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,440
Good!

614
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,280
It was only five metres, but he rode
on the dolphin for the first time.

615
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
I did it!

616
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,920
The last one is the bold move, Lift.

617
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,080
It's this one.

618
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,560
Can Degawa jump?

619
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,560
So low!

620
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,440
He tried hard to jump,

621
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
but it was 20 centimetres.

622
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,480
He's raising his fist in triumph.

623
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,760
But the two new Degawa Girls

624
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,280
accomplished the mission
successfully.

625
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,720
Good.

626
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,000
The dolphin show is a huge success!

627
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
Hurray!

628
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,960
Advisor, Yumeppe, Yokota, well done!

629
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,480
Yokota made lots of effort.

630
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,080
It was difficult and it was quite
high up and I was scared,

631
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,240
and Mr Degawa attempted
to cause a falling-out.

632
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,680
I actually wasn't trying
to make you two fight.

633
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,640
He says no.

634
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,320
I wanted to ignite Yumeppe's
competitiveness

635
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,720
to make her succeed.

636
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,080
You didn't need to meddle.

637
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,720
It was uncalled for.

638
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,840
Let's move on to our next segment.
Imoto, please.

639
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Okay. Next, it's this.

640
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,200
Asako Ito's Mystery Tour!

641
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
A two-hour bullet train ride
from Tokyo,

642
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,680
Asako Ito's Mystery Tour in Kinki.

643
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
Kinki!

644
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,600
You're curious, right?

645
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,440
The thing that catches my attention
is the mosquito near her eye.

646
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,360
A mosquito is here.

647
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,360
No way.

648
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
- It's swollen already.
- Amazing!

649
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
It's going to be itchy.

650
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,440
It's bothering me.

651
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,880
She has come to Tandenji Temple
in Kyoto.

652
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,400
It's a 300-year-old
historical temple, but...

653
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,080
This is bad. Look.

654
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,200
The wall of the hall
is full of scribbles.

655
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,040
The monk, Gyokaku Horio, knows why.

656
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,160
This temple is called Tandenji,

657
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,240
it's commonly called
the Scribble Temple.

658
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
- Scribble Temple?
- Yes.

659
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,720
There are Ema tablets when you go
to shrines or temples,

660
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,680
but instead of those,

661
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,040
we want Daikokuten
to see them more clearly,

662
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,840
so people write their wishes
on the wall.

663
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,240
- Oh, they're people's wishes?
- That's right.

664
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,680
The unique way of praying
started about 60 years ago.

665
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,280
If you offer 300 yen,

666
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,160
anyone can write on the wall.

667
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,240
- I wrote it.
- What did you write?

668
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,320
"I pray Imoto won't call Mr Ishizaki
"husband" in her radio show again."

669
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Why shouldn't I?

670
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,920
I don't understand.

671
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,560
There's a comedian named Ayako Imoto

672
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,440
who married our director,
Mr Ishizaki.

673
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,320
- I see.
- I explained to the monk.

674
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,880
She keeps saying "my husband"
unnecessarily in her radio show.

675
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,360
It's out of spite?

676
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,560
The walls of Daikoku Hall
are painted white every December,

677
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,440
so visitors can write new wishes
on them again the next year.

678
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,520
So behind these wishes,

679
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,800
the wishes written last year
are still there.

680
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,400
- Lovely! They accumulate?
- Yes.

681
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,160
So if your wish comes true,

682
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,360
it's because various people
behind you helped you.

683
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,200
That's why it comes true.

684
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,280
Isn't this wonderful?

685
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,200
It's a place where a show like ours
shouldn't come.

686
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,200
- That's not true.
- No?

687
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,480
I agree with her.

688
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,040
The Mystery Tour in Kinki
starts now.

689
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,120
First, solve the mystery.

690
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,240
A mysterious man who draws
enormous portraits.

691
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,800
First, solve the mystery.

692
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,040
A mysterious man who draws
enormous portraits.

693
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

694
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,160
This is Mr Naoki Shimizu.

695
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,800
How big are the portraits you draw?

696
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,400
It's about two square kilometres.

697
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,240
I can draw anywhere in the city.

698
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,920
Wow, scary.

699
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,480
I don't get it at all.

700
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,960
What is the enormous portrait
drawn in the city?

701
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
GPS app.

702
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,160
The tracking function
of the running app

703
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,400
colours the places
I've passed through,

704
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,160
and I use it to draw pictures on
the ground. It's called running art.

705
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,160
- Oh, it's Bakatono-sama.
- Yes.

706
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,560
- Impressive.
- This is interesting.

707
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,120
Not anyone can be drawn.

708
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,280
It depends on whether
the map fits or not.

709
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,160
- It does.
- It does a bit, right?

710
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Koshien Stadium
is in Nishinomiya City.

711
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,840
Two roads to its north
converge at the ideal angle,

712
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,680
so it's perfect to be the vertical
lines of Mr Degawa's chubby face.

713
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,600
That's it.

714
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,480
To draw Degawa, the running distance
is about 21 kilometres.

715
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
Go!

716
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,800
Oh, it's been a long time.

717
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,920
She only runs at this location.

718
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,080
By the way, you're drawing
Mr Degawa's mouth now.

719
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,200
The width of his mouth
is about 500 metres,

720
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,080
but she'll draw the upper lip,
the lower lip and wrinkles,

721
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,480
so she'll run six kilometres
only for that.

722
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,320
"Distance of the mouth: 6km"

723
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,200
Asako was full of energy
at the start,

724
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,600
but after running 10 kilometres,

725
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,320
every part of her body
starts to hurt.

726
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,200
May I announce
which part of Asako hurts now?

727
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,960
I've been feeling pain here
since the start.

728
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Here, right? And here, and...

729
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,240
- At that time...
- What happened?

730
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,160
Here, and here...

731
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,160
- What?
- What is it?

732
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,920
Something came out?

733
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,800
Mysterious liquid came out
from Asako's body.

734
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Was that sweat?

735
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,160
That's right,
it was a large amount of sweat.

736
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,480
What?

737
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,760
- No way.
- Where was it stored?

738
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,160
- You didn't know?
- Are you kidding me?

739
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,560
Are you kidding me?

740
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,600
That was scary.

741
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,680
When you saw that,

742
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,480
do you want to do something for me?

743
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
So she'll do a Bicycle Challenge.

744
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,040
You now run one kilometre
in 7 minutes and 40 seconds.

745
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,960
So slow!

746
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,120
From now on, if you run 1 kilometre
in less than seven minutes,

747
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,680
you ride a bicycle
for two kilometres.

748
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,240
If it's shorter than six minutes,
you get 4 kilometres on a bicycle.

749
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,960
We'll do this challenge.

750
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh, no, I couldn't hear you at all.

751
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,400
I only remember seven and four.

752
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,640
Too many numbers?

753
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
Maybe.

754
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
The Bicycle Challenge starts.

755
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,240
If she runs one kilometre
as fast as she can,

756
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,720
she'll get a reward of a maximum
of four kilometres on a bicycle.

757
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,720
It's different.

758
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,040
Your pace is good. 60 metres to go.

759
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
- Will she make it?
- You can do it!

760
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,120
One kilometre!

761
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes! One kilometre!

762
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,720
- Six minutes and 18 seconds.
- Impressive!

763
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,480
You can't complain.

764
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,840
She gets four kilometres
on a bicycle.

765
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,800
Good for you.

766
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,600
Ouch.

767
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,320
Her hip is groaning.

768
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,600
I should've kicked it up
before I ride.

769
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,480
Why don't you just go forward?

770
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,440
Will it go up?

771
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
Ouch.

772
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,160
Her whole body is worn out,

773
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,640
but she'll run again
in the remaining five kilometres.

774
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,720
Let's say,

775
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,800
can this be a triathlon?

776
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,320
What do you mean?

777
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,760
Running,

778
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,040
cycling,

779
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,640
riding on a car.

780
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
It'd be nice to have
a ride on a car.

781
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,880
What am I trying to solve?

782
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,480
The mystery of a man
who draws enormous portraits.

783
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,640
We've already solved the mystery.

784
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,200
A long time ago.

785
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,560
It's the last spurt,
the goal is right ahead.

786
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,480
It's late at night.

787
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
And then...

788
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,880
- The goal?
- It's the goal!

789
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,000
It's the goal.

790
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,920
The goal. The goal.

791
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,320
What will Degawa's portrait
look like?

792
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,680
Let's see it.

793
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,720
Ready, go.

794
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,480
Mr Degawa!

795
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,400
What?

796
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,400
She ran 21 kilometres
in Nishimiya City,

797
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,560
and it took about five hours...

798
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,320
to finish a huge Degawa
that's two square kilometres big.

799
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,040
Are you satisfied with the result?

800
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
Very satisfied.

801
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
This is how much I've run.

802
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,440
I'm scared to think
about tomorrow's shooting.

803
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
Mr Degawa, what should I do?

804
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,880
What will they make me do tomorrow?

805
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,760
It's sprinting tomorrow.

806
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,920
Why?

807
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,040
Next, a mysterious man who goes
against human evolution.

808
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,440
Next, a mysterious man who goes
against human evolution.

809
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,640
It's this person. Please come here.

810
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,520
What? What? He's fast!

811
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,880
Are you kidding me?

812
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,320
That's human, right?

813
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,760
A human who sprints on four legs.

814
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,480
Hello!

815
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,520
I'm four-legged Kenichi Ito!
Nice to meet you.

816
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,640
Mr Ito is the person who turned
quadruped walking into a sport.

817
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,440
Humans evolved from four-legged
to two-legged,

818
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,000
but Mr Ito goes against it.

819
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,080
We use our forelegs as hands
to use tools,

820
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
so we evolved for the convenience.

821
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,640
So regarding running speed,

822
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,240
from four-legged to two-legged
is devolution.

823
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
I've been running like this
for 18 years,

824
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,560
and my speed isn't any slower
than a two-legged runner.

825
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,000
First, they'll have a 100-metre race
to demonstrate Mr Ito's ability.

826
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,000
Besides Asako,

827
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,920
our filming crew's fast runner,
cameraman Odani, will join the race.

828
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,240
His record when he was a student
was 11.20 seconds.

829
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,560
It was in high school, right?

830
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,560
Ready, get set, go!

831
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Asako is still exhausted
from the marathon,

832
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,440
and drops out early.

833
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,840
He's fast.

834
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,080
It's a race between the four-legged
man and our fastest runner.

835
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,440
Who will win?

836
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,200
So cool!

837
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,880
Mr Ito wins.

838
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,480
Mr Ito is a world record holder
of quadruped running.

839
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,960
His record at that time
was 15.71 seconds.

840
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,680
He's fast!

841
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,040
Really, it reminds me
of the summer day

842
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,520
I ran after my dog when it ran away.

843
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,160
It's called quadruped running,
but it's profound.

844
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,200
- Yes... I see...
- This is bad, her body...

845
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,920
- It's quite good.
- She ran for so long.

846
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
First, you'll learn how to trot.

847
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,240
What kind of animal?

848
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,160
Dogs, cats, horses... Most
of the four-legged animals trot.

849
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,080
You walk like this.

850
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,760
It changes to a form
called bounding halfway.

851
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,560
- It's like this.
- Yes, I did that.

852
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,680
Some of the crocodiles,

853
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,160
and wallaby do this.

854
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,360
- Wallaby.
- Yes.

855
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,600
Also, the foot and the hand on
the same side move together

856
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,000
that is the way that giraffes and
elephants walk and amble.

857
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,760
And knuckle walk, the way gorillas
and chimpanzees walk, are included.

858
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,960
Knuckle walk.

859
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,880
Start!

860
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,560
Mr Ito believes the fastest human
runner will be a four-legged runner,

861
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,120
so he's making effort to recruit
and train runners.

862
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,080
You're strong.

863
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,120
Very good! Very good!

864
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,720
For the time being, the number
of runners in the world is 150.

865
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,880
Let's see the result of her practise

866
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,320
today in Asako's
100-metre quadruped race.

867
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,840
Ms Asako, if you can run 100 metres
in less than one minute,

868
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,280
the quadruped running
women's section will be shocked.

869
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,560
Running 100 metres in less than
one minute on the first day is fast?

870
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,880
It's awesome.

871
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
They'll be shocked.

872
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,640
Ready, get set, go!

873
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,200
Asako started
with the bounding she's good at.

874
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,000
- Watch out.
- Do your best, Asako!

875
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,600
Do your best...

876
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,440
But she slowed down already.

877
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,480
Do your best.

878
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,320
And finally, she crawls.

879
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
She ran a marathon yesterday
and runs on all fours today,

880
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,160
but she still works hard
without any complaint.

881
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,920
That's what is good about Asako.

882
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,880
Do your best.

883
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,120
Good...

884
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,120
Do your best!

885
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,480
Then she reaches the finish line
by sheer determination.

886
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,080
Her time is far from
her goal, one minute.

887
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,120
It's 2 minutes and 38 seconds.

888
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,720
It's the goal.

889
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,560
"Record: 2:38.00"

890
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,880
Places that are different
from yesterday's hurt.

891
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,800
Next, mysterious luminous bodies
that run about in darkness.

892
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,400
She comes to a gymnasium.

893
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,120
And then...

894
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,760
Wow, amazing!

895
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,720
Wow, it's so beautiful!
Are they shining ribbons?

896
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,320
Numerous lights run around
in darkness.

897
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,440
So cool.

898
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,600
They are actually ribbons
with LED light.

899
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
It's so beautiful.

900
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,520
The latest device was developed by
Stage Technology Group, mplusplus,

901
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,240
and it's manipulated by dancers
to create a beautiful stage.

902
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,560
It's so cool.

903
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,480
Asako will try this
to conclude the tour.

904
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,400
I see.

905
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,480
Children might not know,

906
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,360
but ribbon is Asako's special trick.

907
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,760
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Minami Asakura, 51 years old.

908
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm so annoyed.

909
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,400
51-year-old Minami is annoyed!

910
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,560
She took the world by storm in 2009.

911
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,680
I didn't.

912
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,360
Nice to meet you.

913
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,040
Nice to meet you.

914
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,440
She'll be taught by members of
the dance team, Via Colorguard.

915
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,160
In a performance competition
that uses flags, the Japan Cup,

916
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,160
they had been the national champion.

917
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,080
First, she'll use a common ribbon
to practise the choreography.

918
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,120
Raise your left arm gradually.

919
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,080
Ouch.

920
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,800
Wait, Ms Asako...

921
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,120
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
I'm going to say "ouch"
every now and then,

923
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,440
please ignore me.

924
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,080
I'll probably keep saying that.

925
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,800
The highlight is to wave the ribbon
and move acrobatically.

926
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,320
Your left leg... That's right.

927
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,920
Ouch...

928
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,320
Kneeling is already difficult.

929
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,640
- I'll stay like this?
- Yes.

930
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,200
- Right leg...
- Sit down...

931
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,640
Ouch! The transmitter.

932
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,440
Asako is hurting everywhere.

933
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,400
Actually, she had filmed at other
locations that abused her body.

934
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,320
First, she went to see the man who
lifts the tallest Styrofoam tower,

935
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,480
and became his pupil.

936
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,400
Asako aimed to take 10 layers
and got trained, but...

937
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,400
She couldn't do it
no matter how long she practised.

938
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,400
Her beige T-shirt changed colour
because of her sweat.

939
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,320
A lot of sweat.

940
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,120
Wow, that's messy.

941
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,080
You shouldn't wipe mud on it.

942
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,400
I didn't know what I was doing.

943
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,600
Also, in Osaka, she soaked
in a too-powerful hot tub.

944
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,560
Does it come right after I press?

945
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,520
It's a powerful hot tub.

946
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,000
Then, quadruped running,

947
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,680
and a 21-kilometre marathon.

948
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,320
Here, and here... what?

949
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,040
Here, and here... what?

950
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,200
It's just adding insult to injury.

951
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,160
And the mosquito at the opening.

952
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,000
Ouch.

953
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,600
At the same time, a LED ribbon.

954
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,640
This time, Asako will be
the centre dancer.

955
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,960
If she makes a mistake,
it'll ruin the show.

956
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,280
This is bad.

957
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,360
The towel to prevent my sweat
from flying everywhere

958
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,120
is going to fall
after absorbing my sweat.

959
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,480
This towel is used to absorb
the sweat from Asako's scalp,

960
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,080
it's commonly called Asako Roll.

961
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,440
Can I change this?

962
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,080
I can't let anyone touch this.

963
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,200
It looks like a rubbish bag.

964
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,240
It's heavy.

965
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,600
She practised so hard
that the towel was soaking wet.

966
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,880
Now, the actual performance

967
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,440
by Asako with Via Colorguard,

968
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,080
a LED Ribbon Performance.

969
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,680
This is Asako?

970
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,560
Impressive.

971
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,480
So cool...

972
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,800
Maybe it isn't me... Is it me?

973
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,360
This is me?

974
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,840
Don't I look amazing?

975
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,240
It's so beautiful.

976
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,600
You're doing it.

977
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Amazing.

978
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,960
Beautiful.

979
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,200
We can't tell where Asako is now,
but the show is beautiful.

980
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,360
It's beautiful.

981
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,480
It's impressive.

982
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,600
There she is.

983
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
"Asako"

984
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,280
Her name is shining.

985
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,880
Asako moves to the centre again.

986
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,040
The climax is her solo part.

987
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,520
Amazing.

988
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,080
So cool...

989
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,720
It must have hurt to do this.

990
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,080
She is hurting everywhere,
but she performed successfully.

991
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,040
Amazing.

992
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,520
So cool!

993
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,280
Ouch.

994
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,880
Ouch...

995
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,640
How was the tour?

996
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,440
Well, I think that
the programme wasn't right.

997
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,840
Have you forgotten?

998
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,200
I'm 51.

999
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,000
That's all for the Mystery Tour
of sweat and tears.

1000
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,840
Don't use this to conclude it!

1001
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,160
The editing was done
with ill intention.

1002
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,160
Exactly.

1003
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,200
The editing was really nasty.

1004
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,560
She wiped her face with a towel
and opened her eyes,

1005
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,200
but her eyelids got a bit stuck.

1006
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,960
What was that?

1007
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,600
They got a bit stuck
and went up late.
