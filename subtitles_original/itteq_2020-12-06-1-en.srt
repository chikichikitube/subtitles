1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,760
When I look up at the sky,
it makes me want to cry.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh no, oh no.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,320
"The Quest"

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,880
"This programme was broadcast
6th December, 2020"

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,640
The Quest has started.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,480
Tonight, we have rare animal hunter
Imoto, a Japan Tour, and...

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,120
Gone Forever.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,080
"Ayako Imoto, Daisuke Miyagawa,
Asako, Ito, Tetsuro Degawa, Miyazon"

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,040
"Kazuko Kurosawa, Miyuki Oshima
Tomoko Murakami"

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,880
"Imoto Japan Tour in Okayama,
She'll try that sport again!"

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,840
- This is super hard.
- Right?

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,520
This is nerve-racking.
Am I doing bypass surgery?

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,000
I never fail.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,800
It's not about fishing here.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,280
I got one already.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,200
So I put this on?

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,880
Have you seen a doll like this
in a museum?

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,280
Aiming to conquer
all 47 prefectures of Japan!

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,440
Rare Hunter Imoto,

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
Japan Tour.

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,400
She's going to Okayama this time,

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,920
known for its many
Momotaro legends.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,480
Hello! It's Imoto!

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,120
I'm here in Okayama.

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,080
Where am I?

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,920
Now, it's the usual "Find Imoto"!

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,960
Is she all the way at the top?

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,200
No, all the way on the left.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,560
- I'm here! I'm here!
- Where is she?

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,160
- I'm right here!
- That was impossible.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,800
- You couldn't find that.
- The correct answer is...

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,480
- I was being part of...
- That's hard.

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,120
the Mizushima Industrial Complex.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,440
You can't see that!

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,160
A vital part of Okayama's industry,
Mizushima Industrial Complex.

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,680
Its overall area is equivalent
to 520 Tokyo Domes,

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,440
and it contains over 220 businesses.

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,440
It's Japan's leading heavy chemical
industrial complex.

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,040
This is a prominent steel mill
in Japan, JFE Steel.

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,360
Wow!

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
That's beautiful!

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,760
- It's like fireworks.
- Amazing!

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is the refining process.

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
Molten iron is poured
into the furnace,

45
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
and all impurities are removed...

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,280
- by chemical oxidation.
- It's red.

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
This is impressive.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,320
It's like a show.

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,960
- I'm no longer impressed by it.
- What?

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,800
Molten iron is cut into different
shapes while it's still hot.

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,240
There's a roll called a "work roll"
inside this chunk.

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,080
When the plates go through it,

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,040
it's gradually pressed down.

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,320
This steel mill operates 24 hours.

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,880
It produces eight million tonnes
of steel annually.

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,600
We have someone from Tottori
in our company as well.

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
What school are you from?

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
Yonago Higashi High.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's a super smart school.

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,680
- You're from Yonago Nishi High.
- Yes, I'm from Yonago Nishi High.

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
What is Yonago Nishi High like?

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Yonago Nishi High is known...

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,440
- for their beautiful girls.
- Thank you very much.

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
It's true.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,920
It's true. That's local knowledge.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,240
Yonago Nishi High is known to have
cute girls.

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
I won a beauty contest
at that school.

68
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,560
- Really?
- Let's start the Okayama Tour!

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,000
The reason she's in Okayama
is to attempt this challenge.

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
It's highlining.

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Highlining in Okayama?
I've never heard of it.

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Slacklining is done by balancing
on a thin belt.

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,120
Highlining is slacklining done
at great heights.

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
Imoto challenged it
in the United States a year ago,

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,720
but she was so terrified that
she couldn't complete it.

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
- This is scary! It's terrifying.
- It is terrifying.

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,760
- This is scary.
- I practised for a day..

78
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,480
and then I was taken 100 metres
above ground level.

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
That was a traumatic experience.

80
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,040
- Okayama has a highlining expert.
- There he is.

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,440
He's on it already.

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,760
Toru Osugi,

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,160
the first Japanese slackliner
to become a world champion.

84
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,400
In highlining,

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,280
he achieved a crossing
of 101 metres last year.

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,720
In Okayama?

87
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Yes, at a place called Ojigatake.

88
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,920
Imoto will practise for four days
while continuing her Japan Tour.

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,800
She will challenge highlining,
overlooking the Seto Inland Sea.

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
Do you think I can do it?

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,000
If you think you can do it,
then you'll be able to do it.

92
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
If you practise thinking
that work is making you do it,

93
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,400
then it will be impossible.

94
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,760
Honestly, until you said that,

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
I came here thinking,

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,920
"This is my job,
so I have to do it."

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,600
So then, what am I doing
slacklining for?

98
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,400
To show everybody you can do it...

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,920
- when you attempt it.
- That's it.

100
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,200
I think it might be impossible.

101
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,320
She'll think about the reasons
for doing it later...

102
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,760
She'll report on Japan's best
in Okayama!

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
This is the place.

104
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,520
Amazing!

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,760
- Those are uniforms.
- There are a lot here.

106
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,000
That's cute.

107
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Okayama is the largest producer
of school uniforms in Japan.

108
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,400
About 70% of school uniforms
in Japan are made here in Okayama.

109
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,560
So now, let's update
Imoto's uniform!

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
I've always worn the sailor-style
uniform, so I admire blazer types...

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,360
What should it be now?

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,880
- Like what Nogizaka is wearing?
- No way.

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
Hope is rising.

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,520
For this 34-year-old.

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,680
She'll select one from the uniforms
that are offered to her.

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
This is cool too.

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,640
This part is sailor style, but
this bit is more like a blazer.

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,640
This one combines sailor style
and blazer together.

119
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,280
It's currently a popular design
called a sailor jacket.

120
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,360
These are gender-neutral uniforms.

121
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,800
What are gender-neutral uniforms?

122
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,240
Female students can wear trousers,

123
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,840
and choose between
a tie or a ribbon.

124
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
I admire this one too.

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
A one-piece dress style.

126
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,600
This reminds me
of an all-girls group.

127
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,640
This is interesting too.

128
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,360
That part comes off.

129
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,400
This chequered part can come off.

130
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,160
- The uniform Imoto selected is...
- Which one?

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Hi, I'm Ayako Imoto, also known as
Imorin with Nogizaka48.

132
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,480
- Imorin?
- Imorin.

133
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,680
It's 46.

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
So what do you think, Miyagawa?

135
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,200
Do I look good in this?

136
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,320
- I'm so glad!
- He's silent.

137
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
That much?

138
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
How about you, Degawa?

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,600
- What? Mai Shiraishi? No!
- Well...

140
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,480
That's too much of a compliment.

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,760
How about you, Uchimura?

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,920
- No one's saying anything.
- I'm about to cry.

143
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Why is she about to cry?

144
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,280
Now that she's updated her uniform,
let's get her new shoes.

145
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
This is Mr Watanabe from
the sales planning department.

146
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,960
The world's highest peak.
You won't slip...

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,920
Your tongue was actually slipping
just now.

148
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,320
Nisshin Rubber spent
10 years developing...

149
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,960
these anti-slip shoes, Hyper V.

150
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,560
Their secret is in the soles.

151
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,160
What? This won't slip?

152
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
Yes, that's right.

153
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not like the treads
are that deep.

154
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,400
The V-shape and the slanted sole.

155
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,720
This will repel water
and it won't slip.

156
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,120
Even on a stainless steel slope
covered with oil...

157
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,080
That's a bit...

158
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
You're right.

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,160
- It doesn't slip.
- It's not slipping at all.

160
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,680
Hyper V is amazing!

161
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,120
Wow!

162
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,840
It's like an NTV shop.

163
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
Now, let's do a slippery experiment.

164
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
If you are in Hyper-Vs,

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,920
can you win a slippery tug of war
against three people by yourself?

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,440
The Nisshin Rubber team is wearing
ordinary shoes.

167
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
Ready, go!

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
- Imoto!
- Amazing.

169
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,080
The Nisshin Rubber team is being
pulled as soon as it begins.

170
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,920
On the other hand, the Hyper-Vs...

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,960
display an impressive grip.

172
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,560
And then...

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,520
Yes!

174
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
Yes!

175
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,600
- Hyper V is awesome!
- It's amazing.

176
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,840
Yes!

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,040
- Hyper V!
- Amazing.

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,360
However, suspicions were raised.

179
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
There's a possibility...

180
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,280
that this is what they want.

181
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,160
They want to show how impressive
Hyper V is to everyone in Japan,

182
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
so it's better for them
if Hyper V wins this match.

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm starting to feel...

184
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,040
that I might be participating
in something outrageous.

185
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,640
Then let's have another match.

186
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,840
It's Nishimoto with Nisshin Rubber
in Hyper Vs versus The Quest team.

187
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,920
We won't slack off at all.
We're dead serious.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
- The firm's future is on the line.
- Yes.

189
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,120
This will be broadcast,
even if you lose.

190
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
We will do this in earnest.

191
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
Start!

192
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,840
Come on!

193
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,200
The Quest team
is unable to stand firm.

194
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,080
Seconds after they start,
Imoto falls.

195
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
We want to show you a serious match.

196
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,920
Come on!

197
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,920
It looks fishier than before.

198
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,520
- Pull! Don't lose!
- You want their advert?

199
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,040
This is the fate of the show's team
dealing with a slippery surface.

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,520
Meanwhile, she continues
to practise her highlining skills.

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,760
She had an unexpected guest
this day.

202
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,200
- Who is the guest?
- By the way, who is that?

203
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360
He's the Governor.

204
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
Did you supply him
with the school uniform?

205
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,760
- Of course not.
- Okayama's Governor?

206
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,160
What? Wait. They're coming this way.

207
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,680
We are so grateful that you came
to Okayama...

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
- we would like to cheer you on.
- Amazing.

209
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,800
If you have some time,
please join me.

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,120
Usually, you wouldn't take up
the offer...

211
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,600
but the Governor of Okayama
is serious about hospitality.

212
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,440
If you could see
how much it shakes...

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
It's quite-- Oh!

214
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,880
It shakes this much?

215
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
It's a lot more--

216
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
Right? Thank you, Governor.

217
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,080
Right?

218
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,880
Is someone shaking this?

219
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Right?

220
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
The Governor knows
how to do his job.

221
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,480
- Okay.
- He's amazing.

222
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,720
It's fine. Go ahead.

223
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,560
Be careful.

224
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,120
Be careful. Governor!

225
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,840
- Governor!
- Wow!

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
- Amazing.
- Governor, be careful!

227
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
Aren't you shaking it?

228
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
That was all you, Governor.

229
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,320
- You're good.
- Thank you very much.

230
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,920
- In just a few days?
- I've been practising hard.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
- Thank you very much.
- The governor completed his job...

232
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,360
and left.

233
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,800
Now, back to Japan Tour!

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,280
Next up, rare animals in Okayama!

235
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
This is it.

236
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,400
There it is!

237
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,360
There it is!

238
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
There it is!

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
A Japanese giant salamander!

240
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,320
The Japanese giant salamander
is a special natural monument,

241
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,280
that hasn't changed its form much
in 30 million years.

242
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,520
Yubara Hot Spring in Maniwa,
Okayama...

243
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,520
is Japan's famous habitat
of the Japanese giant salamander,

244
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
chosen by the government.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,800
It blends in with the rocks,
you really can't tell it's there.

246
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,920
- It really does.
- It's hard to spot them.

247
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
What do they eat?

248
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,800
They mainly eat fish.

249
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,040
- They eat fish?
- Yes.

250
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
They chew them to eat them?

251
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,160
- They go "Gulp!"
- Oh, I see.

252
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,880
They gulp them down in 0.05 seconds.

253
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,880
In 0.05 seconds?

254
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,560
That was fast.

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,160
Today, we'll observe
an ecological survey of them.

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,160
The Japanese giant salamanders
they catch are weighed and measured.

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,520
Their health is examined,

258
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
and an IC chip is implanted.

259
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
It's done using a syringe.

260
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
It's policy to implant it
in their left shoulder.

261
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,000
- It's going in.
- This is how we do it.

262
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
- That looks painful.
- That must hurt.

263
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,920
It hurts a little. It's fine.

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay, it's all done!

265
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,000
It's all done! Good job.

266
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,480
Okayama has another
well-known rare animal.

267
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,760
There it is...

268
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280
It was just sitting there. What?

269
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,520
What is this?

270
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,120
It looks just like a capybara.

271
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,720
This is a nutria. It belongs to
the South American rat family,

272
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,760
just like the capybara.

273
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,720
It's a mammal regularly seen
in the rivers of Okayama.

274
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
Its teeth are orange.

275
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,840
Are all nutrias like that?

276
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,920
They are all like that.

277
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,560
After World War II, the government
brought in and encouraged...

278
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,880
raising nutria as a measure
to fight food shortages,

279
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,400
but once they weren't needed,
they were released into the wild,

280
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,760
and they multiplied explosively
in the western part of Japan.

281
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,200
It is now seen as a noxious beast
that tears up rice paddies.

282
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,000
Its eradication is recommended.

283
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,080
I like it a lot.

284
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,600
Thank you very much.

285
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
We don't get that too often.

286
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
"Heh heh heh"

287
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
Professor Kobayashi has been
studying nutria for 10 years.

288
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
He first began his research
in order to eradicate them,

289
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,960
but he was captivated by them.

290
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,000
He is now searching for a way
to co-exist with nutria.

291
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,400
What? You're going home?

292
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,600
"Ha ha ha"

293
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,880
There are no more carrots!

294
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,200
The two of them have
this healing effect.

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Really?

296
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,560
I think of capybaras soaking
in hot springs...

297
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,280
How is the nutria connected
to hot springs?

298
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
Do they like them?

299
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
Shall I add some hot water?

300
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,840
Do nutria like hot baths?

301
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,600
Hey, nutria.

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
They prepared warm water,
at human body temperature.

303
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,200
Don't push me.

304
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,840
Don't push me.
Don't you dare push me.

305
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,320
Oh, it's hot!

306
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,800
He went in. It's hot!

307
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,840
It's hot.

308
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,800
Let's cool it down a bit.

309
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,520
This movement...

310
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
is exactly like Degawa's.

311
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,320
His reaction.

312
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,640
So we've seen the Japanese giant
salamander and the nutria.

313
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Next up is the strongest hornet,
the Japanese giant hornet.

314
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,440
Yasutake Atsuta,
an expert in capturing hornets.

315
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,360
Isn't this the most dangerous one?

316
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,160
It's the most dangerous
and biggest one around.

317
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,120
That's why it's fun.

318
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,280
No, no, no.

319
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,880
So once you capture them...

320
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,480
- you just enjoy them?
- Yes.

321
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,840
I capture them mainly for shipment.

322
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,160
I have three kids,

323
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,560
they all love hornet larvae.

324
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,160
- Your kids eat them?
- They love it.

325
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,560
There it is.

326
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,560
You found them?

327
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,520
It's here!

328
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,200
- Those are huge.
- It's huge.

329
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,200
- It's huge!
- It's huge.

330
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,560
It's super huge. The Japanese
giant hornet is super huge.

331
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,400
This is some bait Atsuta set up...

332
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,480
- to lure the Japanese giant hornet.
- That looks scary.

333
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,800
I set a hive
of Japanese yellow hornet here.

334
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,600
Japanese giant hornets
eat other hornets?

335
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,360
Yes, they do. Hornets other than
the Japanese giant hornets...

336
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,560
are just food to them.

337
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,560
That's something else.

338
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,640
Then I put a cute ribbon on them.

339
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,520
This ribbon is tied to the hornet,

340
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,400
to chase it back to its hive.

341
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
Do you want to get close?

342
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,000
Atsuta is something else.

343
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
Can you put it on its body?

344
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,080
He's touching it.

345
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,960
- Really? That's something else.
- What?

346
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
Directly?

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,920
No, it'll sting you.

348
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,360
Here's Atsuta's expertise.

349
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,200
- He's coming this way.
- He's touching it.

350
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
This is no joke. Wait! Wait!

351
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
This is dangerous right now, right?

352
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
No, this is their feeding ground.

353
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,280
Stinging hardly ever happen
on a feeding ground.

354
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,160
Japanese giant hornets mainly get
aggressive around their hive.

355
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
The key is to tie
the ribbon around it...

356
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
while it's focused on its catch.

357
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,440
Like so.

358
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,080
It didn't like it, so it took it off
with its leg.

359
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,240
It noticed the string.

360
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,600
It noticed.

361
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,840
Will she do it this time?

362
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,920
She did it.

363
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
Slowly tie it.

364
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,080
Remember what you learnt.
Hold the base.

365
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,600
- Amazing.
- You're shaking a lot.

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,880
This is amazing.

367
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,120
Just a bit more...

368
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,080
Okay!

369
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,520
- Amazing.
- I did it!

370
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,720
I did it!

371
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,640
You're sweating like mad.

372
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,560
I was so nervous.

373
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,200
It's scary.
That was nerve-racking.

374
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,440
It felt like I did bypass surgery.

375
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,320
I never fail.

376
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
That was close.
I'm glad I didn't fail.

377
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,440
Then it will fly off.

378
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,040
The Japanese giant hornet
flies fast.

379
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,640
Its territory spans
a few kilometres.

380
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,680
We'd lose them if we randomly
chased them.

381
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,680
- There it is!
- It's flying.

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,440
The hornet flying from its nest
to the feeding ground...

383
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,080
is observed carefully,
to locate its hive.

384
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
After three hours of searching...

385
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Amazing.

386
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,400
There's a hive for sure.

387
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
There are a lot coming and going.

388
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
All right, let's go.

389
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,920
They are in full protective gear
to go get them.

390
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,880
- This is scary.
- Scary!

391
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,600
See all this soil?
It was dug up by the hornets.

392
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,680
Japanese giant hornets
make their nests underground.

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,760
First, a basket is placed
at the entrance to the hive,

394
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,040
to capture the hornets
that come out to attack.

395
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,480
- There are a lot in there.
- Amazing.

396
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
See?

397
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,200
There's one with a ribbon.

398
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,720
There it is!

399
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,640
- It tore it off.
- You can see that it's torn?

400
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
Then it digs and digs.

401
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,880
- This is really something.
- Wait a second.

402
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
I think we have something.

403
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,120
- There it is.
- See?

404
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,840
From here...

405
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
- That's something else.
- See?

406
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,600
- That's something else.
- We did it.

407
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
A bunch of them are flying out.

408
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,920
Atsuta is particular about
the taste of hornet larvae,

409
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,960
so he doesn't use smoke
to weaken the hornets.

410
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
- I see.
- That's how they come out?

411
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,880
Oh no!

412
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
- Oh no! Oh no!
- That's why...

413
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,640
all the healthy Japanese
giant hornets attack at once.

414
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm scared!

415
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,160
All right! I found it.

416
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,840
He manages to find
the Japanese giant hornets' larvae.

417
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,880
Amazing.

418
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,160
Atsuta ships out
the ones in cocoons.

419
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
These are all queens.

420
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,080
- What? The ones in this section?
- They're all queen hornets.

421
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,040
They have that many queen hornets?

422
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,080
- You get a lot of them in autumn.
- The queen hornet.

423
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,160
So these are the larvae.

424
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
Over here, its eyes are developed.
It has a face.

425
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,640
Then the colour of its eyes
gets darker,

426
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
and becomes black.

427
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,640
And finally, this is its form
right before it hatches.

428
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,480
- You can see the whole process.
- Interesting.

429
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,760
Japanese giant hornets' larvae
are gigantic too.

430
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,920
- This is the larvae. Hornet larvae.
- You eat that?

431
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,080
Now, let's enjoy them!

432
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,760
You can only eat queen hornet larvae
during this season.

433
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,120
You can enjoy them because
you've come at this time.

434
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,320
Oh, so it's rare
even for hornet larvae.

435
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,880
A rare taste in exchange for danger.

436
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,240
It's very milky and delicious.

437
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,600
There's no odd taste to it.

438
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,360
Everyone around us says
it's disgusting.

439
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,840
Well, since it looks like a bug...

440
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,200
- It's tasty when you eat it.
- Eat it.

441
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
It's good.

442
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,600
- Here.
- They're cute.

443
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
Oh, was it hot?

444
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,840
It was a bit hot.

445
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,840
Is it hot?
Do you want to spit it out?

446
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,120
What's in your mouth?

447
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,160
It's so hot it made me cry.

448
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,280
- I'm sorry.
- He's so cute.

449
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,040
Now, another go at highlining.

450
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,160
The last segment
is another go at highlining.

451
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
She's been practising regularly
since the first day.

452
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,000
It's not 100%,
but she is able to walk across...

453
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,880
- the planned distance.
- Impressive.

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,840
- I'm impressed.
- I just might be a genius.

455
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,000
However, something she was able
to do a moment ago,

456
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,400
becomes a challenge again,
the next second.

457
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,840
Also, her traumatic experience
in the States haunts Imoto.

458
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,720
I want to cry.

459
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,320
Oh no.

460
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,000
This is no joke.
I can't handle this.

461
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,280
I sometimes get scared
with a challenge too,

462
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,200
but I trick myself
and take on the challenge.

463
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,360
Right. The first few times were...

464
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,160
- Highlining is fun in its own way.
- You're right.

465
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
- You look forward to tomorrow.
- I'm looking forward to it.

466
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

467
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,720
It's done at Ojigatake, overlooking
the beautiful Seto Inland Sea.

468
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,040
This is the line.

469
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,680
This is it!

470
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,640
- Wow
- Wow, that's scary.

471
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
This is high.

472
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,560
It's completely different
from yesterday.

473
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
This environment is different.
It's a completely different thing.

474
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,480
The Seto Inland Sea far below her...

475
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,560
adds even more fear
than the actual height.

476
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,200
Even experienced slackliners...

477
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,880
aren't able to perform as usual
without a strong mental disposition.

478
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
Imoto will walk this section.

479
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,280
If you fall close to the rock,

480
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,040
you might smash into the rock.

481
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,920
- I see.
- You'll start from a safe spot...

482
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and end at a safe spot.

483
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,200
I see.

484
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,360
So the actual distance you'll walk
is quite short.

485
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,360
- It's short.
- Yes.

486
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
Taking Imoto's traumatic experience
into consideration,

487
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,680
her lifeline will be attached above.

488
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,200
I've been thinking for the past
five days, why am I doing this.

489
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
My conclusion is,

490
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,640
I don't know!

491
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,440
I don't know why I'm doing this.

492
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
But isn't life like that, though?

493
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,680
- Now, let's go for it!
- Amazing.

494
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,920
Come on!

495
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,560
I'm scared!

496
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,560
I'm scared!

497
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,160
She'll hold the lifeline
until she reaches the start point.

498
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm scared.

499
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,520
Wait.

500
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
You're at the orange tape
position now.

501
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,200
- Okay!
- It's super shaky.

502
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,640
- This requires guts.
- She's standing. That's impressive.

503
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,040
She starts once she takes her hands
off the lifeline.

504
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,320
She's looking up.

505
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
She walks while staring ahead.

506
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,880
It's so scary. Come on.

507
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
- Come on!
- However, here...

508
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
Let's hold it once. Okay.

509
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,520
I'm scared.

511
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,240
Mental weakness leads
to an unbalanced body.

512
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
- One time.
- It's fine.

513
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,880
That's the challenge of highlining.

514
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,560
When I look up at the sky,
it makes me want to cry.

515
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,520
Am I weak now?

516
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,680
Mentally, she's at her limit.

517
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh no.

518
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,880
- She's eating a banana.
- Yet she'll still eat a banana.

519
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,080
- That shows Imoto's strength.
- You need something.

520
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,360
It's been three hours
since she began her challenge.

521
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,680
Three hours is tough.

522
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,880
Okay, let's do this.

523
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
Her 32nd challenge.

524
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
I can do this.

525
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,280
You can do it.

526
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
You'll have to do it.

527
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,280
She takes firm steps
to the starting point.

528
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,400
- Okay. from there.
- Amazing.

529
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,920
This is where she starts.

530
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
Below her is the beautiful
Seto Inland Sea.

531
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,640
- She's not that slow.
- It's so wobbly.

532
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,400
- That's it.
- Amazing.

533
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,440
That's it.

534
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,760
Two more metres remain.

535
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,960
- That looks good.
- From here...

536
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,760
it's all about control and focus.

537
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
- That's right.
- Impressive.

538
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,600
Losing focus...

539
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,880
immediately shows up as instability.

540
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,480
- Just a little more.
- A tiny bit more.

541
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,200
And finally...

542
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,600
- Yes!
- Amazing.

543
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
I did it!

544
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,200
I did it!

545
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,320
I did it!

546
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,840
- I did it!
- Amazing.

547
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
I did it, right?

548
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,640
- Instructor!
- Yes!

549
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
I did it!

550
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
- That was great!
- Thank you very much.

551
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm so happy!

552
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
Governor of Okayama!

553
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,840
I managed to cross it successfully.

554
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
Okayama is the best.
Thank you very much.

555
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,200
Governor!

556
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,040
That's it for the Okayama
Japan Tour!

557
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,760
Next up is this!

558
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,120
- Gone forever!
- Yeah!

559
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,960
Miyazon of Anzen Manzai
will take on the challenge.

560
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,400
This is what he'll challenge!

561
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,400
"Go capture a Bluespotted
Mud Hopper"

562
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,120
Go capture a Bluespotted Mud Hopper.

563
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,120
- Bluespotted Mud Hopper?
- That's hard.

564
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,560
- You don't mean Mutsugoro?
- No.

565
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,360
There's a fish called a Bluespotted
Mud Hopper in Saga.

566
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,160
It's called Mutsukake fishing.

567
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
It's a traditional fishing method
that requires advanced skills...

568
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,840
that have been handed down
at the Ariake Sea in Saga.

569
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
The news footage I saw
had everyone in the mud.

570
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,680
So this is my second time...

571
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,360
- with Director Kitami.
- Right. Chap.

572
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Wasn't it that...

573
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,160
- Dolphin fishing.
- Dolphin fishing!

574
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,680
He likes it muddy.

575
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,600
Do you like it?

576
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,520
I think we can both grow from it.

577
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,520
An entertainer and a director
can both grow from it?

578
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
He's a wonderful chum.

579
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,400
He can't leave
until the goal is met.

580
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,600
Gone Forever.

581
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,520
The first day.

582
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,640
He arrives in Kashima, Saga.

583
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,120
The Ariake Sea has the largest
tidal difference in Japan.

584
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,480
The difference can be
as much as six metres.

585
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,480
Hello.

586
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,640
Hello.

587
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,840
This is Tadayoshi Okamoto, an expert
in Mutsukake fishing.

588
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,520
Have you been Mutsukake fishing
for a long time?

589
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
I've been doing it
for almost 50 years.

590
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,480
I see.

591
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,880
And when he looks down,
what he sees...

592
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,480
The expert's fly is open.

593
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,520
So the way to fish for them is...

594
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,920
Miyazon's kindness is to let
the expert realise it on his own.

595
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,040
How is it done? Is it like...

596
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,360
going, "zip"?

597
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,720
What is the fishing rod like?

598
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
- The rod is--
- It's not like this?

599
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
I see.
Expert, your fly might be undone.

600
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,840
Oh, good.

601
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,280
Okay.

602
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,200
And then, the awkwardness.

603
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,440
So is it okay for me to see
how it's done?

604
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

605
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,000
At the Ariake Sea, the tide ebbs
and flows twice a day,

606
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
and a tidal flat of three kilometres
is created.

607
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,520
Then the Bluespotted Mud Hoppers
appear,

608
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
looking to eat the algae
on the mud surface.

609
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Can I take a look
at your technique?

610
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,080
- Sure.
- Thank you.

611
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,520
A mud sleigh is used to move around
the tidal flat.

612
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,240
Once he sees the target...

613
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
- It's tiring.
- It is tiring.

614
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,800
Amazing.

615
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,920
He's good.

616
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,280
He caught one already.

617
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
- That's an expert!
- No way!

618
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
He dropped the hook just in front
of the Bluespotted Mud Hopper,

619
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,600
and he pulled the rod back
to hook the fish.

620
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,520
This fast technique...

621
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,720
is Ariake Sea's traditional fishing,
Mutsukake fishing.

622
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,920
It's cute.

623
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,600
Strange how it has a blue tint
on its body.

624
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,040
Its body length
is about 15 centimetres.

625
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,800
It's characterised by its blue
spots and unique dorsal fin.

626
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,800
Experts can catch up to three
of them in under a minute.

627
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,080
Miyazon's goal is to catch one
a minute,

628
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,640
and if he catches 10 in 10 minutes,
his mission is accomplished.

629
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,960
That sounds hard.

630
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,160
Now, let's start practising!

631
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,840
Now, let's start practising!

632
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,320
It's super sharp.

633
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,720
These five sharp hooks...

634
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
are what's used to hook
the Bluespotted Mud Hopper.

635
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,680
Like this.

636
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,200
First, he'll use a golf ball.

637
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,480
I see.

638
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,600
He will learn control
by using a golf ball...

639
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,200
that weighs the same
as the fishing hook.

640
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,280
He's super good.

641
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,600
That's quite far.

642
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
Are Bluespotted Mud Hoppers
that far?

643
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
If you get too close,
they run away.

644
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,080
Bluespotted Mud Hoppers are timid.

645
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,960
If they get scared,
they dive back into the mud.

646
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,880
Therefore, a certain distance
must be maintained,

647
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,120
and that's the hard part.

648
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,520
Miyazon's first attempt.

649
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,800
You need to put more power into it.

650
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
This is impossible. Just a moment.

651
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,160
Oh, this is... It's impossible.

652
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,680
I can already see this is going
to be impossible to do.

653
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,520
However, after a few throws,
he is able to control the direction.

654
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,000
But, he is unable to reach
the bottles.

655
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,200
It goes just in front of the bottle.
I can't reach it.

656
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,360
So I haven't been able to control
this part yet.

657
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,320
You can step forward a bit.

658
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,920
So it was fine for me
to step forward.

659
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
That's why I couldn't reach it.

660
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,120
Once he steps forward...

661
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
Amazing!

662
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,920
Miyazon now has a sense
of distance.

663
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,240
He successfully knocks over
all five in no time.

664
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,200
Okay!

665
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
It's hard to believe you're holding
that rod for the first time.

666
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,800
So it was all about the distance.

667
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,400
Let's head out to the tidal flats
with this momentum.

668
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,600
Is it important to handle
the mud sleigh efficiently?

669
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes.

670
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,680
The ironclad rule is to move around
quietly trying not to make a sound.

671
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,160
It's hard not to make any sound.

672
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,600
Oh, I see. Oh, I see.

673
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,920
It's hard to go straight
on this thing.

674
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,920
I see.

675
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,240
He can't help
but make splashing sounds.

676
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,320
It's not about fishing here.

677
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,000
And now, he's stuck in the mud
and is unable to move.

678
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,800
I was told there'd be plenty here.

679
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,160
You're the ones chasing them away.

680
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,200
I see.

681
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
As a result, they achieved nothing,
and then it was over.

682
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,840
They're sensitive.

683
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
Tonight, he'll stay at this house.

684
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,680
- That's nice.
- Amazing.

685
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,160
Hello.

686
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,440
Welcome home.

687
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,560
I like it that I was greeted
with a "Welcome home."

688
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,840
Let me say it.

689
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm home!

690
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,080
This inn is a renovated
100-year-old Japanese-style house.

691
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
Oh! It's like this?

692
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,920
Their speciality is the Goemon bath.

693
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,480
Goemon baths were used from
the Edo period to the early Showa.

694
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,200
It's basically a huge iron pot.

695
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,560
There's so much steam that we can't
show it in a variety show.

696
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,840
Is it okay to take out so much
hot water?

697
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,760
You'll boil to death.

698
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll boil to death...

699
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,280
You have to stand on the wooden
board, or you'll burn yourself.

700
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,280
That's right.

701
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
I see.

702
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,880
I see.

703
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,160
I see.

704
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
I see, it's too hot.

705
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
- He couldn't handle it.
- It's 53 degrees Centigrade.

706
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,960
The much-anticipated dinner is...

707
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,200
seafood from the Ariake Sea.

708
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,040
Is this Bluespotted
Mud Hopper sashimi?

709
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,320
Its appearance is grotesque
but in a good way.

710
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,000
Bluespotted Mud Hopper
goes off quickly,

711
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
and it should only be eaten
on the day it's caught.

712
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,760
It can only be enjoyed locally.

713
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,680
Amazing.

714
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,760
How is it?

715
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,240
- Wow.
- Is it good?

716
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
It's firm. It's good.

717
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,720
It was in the mud,

718
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,080
so I thought it was going to have
an odour to it,

719
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,920
but it has no odour. It's firm,
and super delicious.

720
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,680
Broiling it with in a sweet sauce
is a standard dish as well.

721
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
It's good, right?

722
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,560
It's slightly bitter.

723
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,200
It's quite... Can you eat it all?

724
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Not all of it, so we usually skin it
like I did with the sashimi.

725
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,240
- I see.
- Yes...

726
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,880
There's something in here
that I can't quite swallow.

727
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,080
The second day.

728
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,400
Practising hooking it, using a hook.

729
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,760
We'll use aubergines as Bluespotted
Mud Hoppers to practise hooking.

730
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,560
I see. This is more like
pickled aubergine, though.

731
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,240
You throw it and drop it
on the other side.

732
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,440
- Amazing!
- In one attempt.

733
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,800
What's amazing is how he uses
the fishing rod.

734
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,000
He uses centrifugal force
and its pliability...

735
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,920
to hook the target, like a sniper.

736
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,400
His control is pretty good.

737
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,880
I can't hook it from there.

738
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,280
When he pulls the rod,
the hook faces upwards.

739
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,120
He won't hook a Bluespotted
Mud Hopper this way.

740
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,200
You have to drop the tip of the rod
down a little bit.

741
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,440
So I should pretend
like I'm pulling it this way.

742
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,200
As usual, Miyazon learns fast.

743
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,120
He's successful!

744
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,640
He's utilising the pliability
of the rod as well.

745
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
- Okay.
- What is this?

746
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,920
- I've got it now.
- Amazing.

747
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,680
However, it's not that easy to get.

748
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,480
The expert is right.
He has a lot more to learn!

749
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,000
Once again, he goes out
to the tidal flats to practise.

750
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,640
You should be quiet.

751
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,240
- No "I caught one!" "Yeah!"
- No.

752
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
This is TV,

753
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,640
but I won't react at all.

754
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
We'll add loud comments later.

755
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,480
So now, we'll deliver this
with Miyazon's voiceover.

756
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,360
All right! I'm going to catch you,
Bluespotted Mud Hopper.

757
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,360
With stealthy steps,
and making no sound...

758
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,200
I found one! You're mine!

759
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,120
Go!

760
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,480
That's far.

761
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,800
Ah! It got away.

762
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,680
I'll get it this time!

763
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,960
I can't quite get it.

764
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,040
If you make loud splashing noises,

765
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,880
we'll escape!

766
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,680
He does Bluespotted Mud
Hopper voices too?

767
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,520
Right, Bluespotted Mud Hoppers run
immediately from splashing sounds.

768
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,440
Who's this?

769
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,720
Didn't that sound like Tachiki?

770
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,720
How was that?

771
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,040
- Go!
- It sounded like him.

772
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,920
- I thought it was Tachiki.
- Run!

773
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,440
Failure.

774
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,320
Can I do "Failure" again?

775
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm sorry.

776
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
That was Miyazon?

777
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,080
Failure.

778
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,360
- This is it.
- That's impressive.

779
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Failure.

780
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,440
- That was good.
- The problem is...

781
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,880
the height of where to drop
the hook.

782
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,920
What's required is to throw it low,
and quietly.

783
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,880
That skill has to be hammered in
to the body.

784
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,840
I can't let them realise I'm there.

785
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,560
Tap-tap.

786
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,080
That's the theory, right?

787
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,040
So let's place a bottle...

788
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,720
between your legs, Kitami...

789
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,360
He'll aim for the bottle
between Kitami's legs.

790
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,320
Is it going to work?

791
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,880
He's braving it out.

792
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
The third day.

793
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,080
The low tide only happens
early morning and late at night,

794
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
so he took a day off from
practising Mutsukake fishing.

795
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,640
And he went on a tour of Saga.

796
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,600
He visited
Yoshinogari Historical Park,

797
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,680
known for its remains
from the Yayoi era.

798
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,720
The curator, Tokuhisa,
tells him about it.

799
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,280
I would like you to take a look
at life during the Yayoi era.

800
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,640
This poncho-like outfit
was common in the Yayoi era.

801
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,000
His hairstyle is called "Mizura,"
a common hairstyle for men.

802
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,720
How do you know that men
had their hair like that?

803
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,880
We dug up some hair.

804
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,000
Isn't it possible that that person
was the only one with that style?

805
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,680
So far, they've dug up two
at Yoshinogari.

806
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,840
So there were at least
two people.

807
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,080
So you're describing the Yayoi era
with just two examples.

808
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,040
Yes...

809
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,440
Miyazon goes from his ducktail do
to the Mizura hairstyle.

810
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,280
He's perfect as a person
from the Yayoi era.

811
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,560
Have you seen a doll like this
in a museum?

812
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,600
That huge building over there...

813
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,800
- It's huge.
- We call it a ceremonial hall.

814
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,720
This was a place
where kings discussed politics,

815
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,160
and the shamaness prayed
to their ancestors.

816
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,480
The famous Queen Himiko had to do
these ceremonies as well.

817
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,080
Queen Himiko, is this the sound?

818
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,560
The Yayoi era is known
for its rice cultivation.

819
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,560
The rice here is black.

820
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,000
They ate ancient grains
such as black rice back then.

821
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,440
They cook the rice, Yayoi style.

822
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,600
Are you an employee here?

823
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,720
I work part time.

824
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,640
- You work part time?
- Yes, I work part time.

825
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,840
What time do you finish today?

826
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
If nothing happens,
I'm done around five o'clock.

827
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,960
You clock out at five o'clock
to go home?

828
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,880
Yes, I do.

829
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm actually working hard
at my other job,

830
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,360
so I don't really want to work late.

831
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm sorry. We'll get this done
by five o'clock today.

832
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,120
If I say that, I'll get scolded
by my superiors later.

833
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,240
Superiors? Oh, the people who live
over there?

834
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,280
Right, the people
in the blue outfits.

835
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,560
They stand there pressuring me
not to say anything stupid.

836
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,320
Honestly, the Yayoi feel
is all gone now.

837
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,400
The fourth day.

838
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Miyazon hasn't caught a single
Bluespotted Mud Hopper.

839
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
He goes to the tidal flats.

840
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
That's it.

841
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,160
Go!

842
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
Pull it!

843
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,640
It's there!

844
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,040
Ah!

845
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
It wasn't hooked.

846
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,360
It came off.

847
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,520
This one!

848
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,800
I'll get it this time.

849
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,160
Come on!

850
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,120
Oh no! I was caught!

851
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,280
"He finally caught one"

852
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,640
- He finally caught one.
- Amazing.

853
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
That's a big one.

854
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,360
So he finally caught one,

855
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,080
but he couldn't catch another one
after that.

856
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
So that was Miyazon's voice?

857
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
- Yes.
- I can't catch any.

858
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,240
- Why can't he catch them?
- It must be hard.

859
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,480
It's because each fish is facing
a different direction.

860
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,600
Bluespotted Mud Hoppers don't
line up neatly like aubergines.

861
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,640
Some Bluespotted Mud Hoppers
will be like this.

862
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,600
- Right.
- That's right.

863
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,440
If he can't catch them
in this random positioning,

864
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
he'll be useless on the tidal flats.

865
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,560
You don't just go in from the right,
you go in from the left too.

866
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,560
That's hard.

867
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,560
They become more alert as the number
of failures increases.

868
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,560
I see.

869
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,640
When they sense the hook,

870
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,840
they tense up.

871
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,360
Then they won't be hooked.

872
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
With Mutsukake,

873
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,680
the only thing that moves
is your rod.

874
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
I see.

875
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,480
So you can't let them
sense your presence.

876
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,640
You have to create that.

877
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
So when Bluespotted Mud Hoppers...

878
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,320
are saying "Morning!" to each other,

879
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,800
then when they go, "By the way..."
you smoothly hook them?

880
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
That's right. When they're 10cm away
from each other,

881
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,360
and when one of them is caught,

882
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,840
the other one searches
for the other one with a blank look.

883
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,320
I went to Saga the other day,
and I saw the photographs.

884
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,840
It's really great... Oh?
Like that?

885
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,360
The fifth day.

886
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,440
Saga tour number two.

887
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,840
Do we go on this?

888
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,080
- Yes.
- I see lots of rods in there.

889
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,720
It's for nori farming...

890
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
When you say "Nori",
you mean for rice balls?

891
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
Right, like for 7-Eleven.

892
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,760
I just had some...

893
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,000
Learn why the Ariake Sea is known
for nori.

894
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,280
Is this it?

895
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
Yes, this is the location.

896
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,160
Rods are placed about 100 metres
away from land.

897
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,560
So the nori will be floating
this way?

898
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,400
No, we set the net...

899
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,200
- and we put seeds on it.
- Seeds?

900
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,800
The Ariake Sea's nori is grown in
a unique way called the pole system.

901
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,880
Poles are placed in the sea,
the nets are set,

902
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,880
and then the seeds are strewn.

903
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
They utilise the biggest difference
in tides in all of Japan...

904
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,880
to apply direct sunlight to the nori
when it's low tide,

905
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,200
making it rich in nutrients
and flavour.

906
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
We harvest them at the end
of November.

907
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
At the end of November?

908
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,920
So today, we won't be eating...

909
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,320
any freshly harvested nori?

910
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,840
You can enjoy last year's nori.

911
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,640
I see...

912
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,000
I already had some
at 7-Eleven earlier.

913
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,360
Meanwhile, his Mutsukake
fishing skill has improved rapidly.

914
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,640
Like so?

915
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,640
Even the difficult
vertically positioned ones are...

916
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
I'll bring it in at an angle.

917
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,080
He handles the rod smoothly.

918
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
He's amazing.

919
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,640
He can catch them
from any direction.

920
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
- From the left? There.
- Amazing.

921
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,000
Amazing.

922
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,480
If the rod and the fishing line
can reach it, then I can do it.

923
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,720
The sixth day.

924
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,200
Today...

925
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,440
let me attempt the actual challenge.

926
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,880
He'll have a go at challenging
10 catches in 10 minutes.

927
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,520
All right, here I go!

928
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,960
Miyazon is an expert
at catching aubergines...

929
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,840
- Time's up!
- What?

930
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,160
- You caught two.
- He couldn't do it.

931
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,360
One more time.

932
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,480
He selects a target and catches it.

933
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,840
He then takes it off the hook.

934
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,840
He has to do this at a pace
of one fish per minute,

935
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,680
but his average catch
is still too low.

936
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,440
Time's up.

937
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,040
How many did I catch?

938
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,080
You caught five.

939
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,240
But then Miyazon realises
something at this point.

940
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,000
I finally realised why
I couldn't catch them.

941
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,960
Is it the mud sleigh?

942
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,760
I also wondered if the way
I released the line was wrong,

943
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,600
but the reason was simple.

944
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,080
It was the difference between
standing or sitting.

945
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,720
I actually didn't practise it
sitting down.

946
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,800
That was the issue.

947
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,120
You know how we don't notice
the simplest things?

948
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,920
When I wanted to listen to something
with headphones, it had no sound.

949
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,600
Was it broken? What's wrong?
It turned out to be the volume.

950
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,320
And you know what else?
With cup noodles...

951
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,880
- you pour water in...
- Right.

952
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,360
It's time, and you try to use your
chopsticks and it's hard as a rock.

953
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,320
You poured in cold water.

954
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,440
That doesn't happen.

955
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,880
He's right. Standing or sitting
makes a huge difference.

956
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,680
This is his view
when he's standing.

957
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,600
However, when he sits down,
it's harder to judge the distance.

958
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Also, it's harder to manipulate
the fishing rod.

959
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,640
That's true.

960
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
The height is different.

961
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,200
He repeatedly trains with pickled
aubergines while sitting down.

962
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,160
Oh, don't pull it.

963
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,400
Placement of the hook.

964
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
Direction to pull the rod.

965
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,720
He's good.

966
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,720
He learnt to pull the rod
to the left,

967
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,680
in the most difficult situation when
the fish is positioned lengthways.

968
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,320
Yay!

969
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,440
- And after a week of training...
- One week.

970
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,200
You're either the best or
the second best I've seen so far.

971
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm not the best? You can't tell?

972
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,600
Let's say you're the second best.

973
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,480
Then could you say I'm the best?

974
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,520
If I can catch 10 in 10 minutes,
will you say I'm the best?

975
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,640
Sure.

976
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,280
Will he be able to become
the expert's best apprentice?

977
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
His time starts when Miyazon
throws his hook.

978
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,560
He successfully catches
the first one with the first throw.

979
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,800
"One fish"

980
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,120
One minute later...

981
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,600
He caught his second one.

982
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,000
Amazing.

983
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,640
"Two fish"

984
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,280
And another minute later...

985
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,400
He's catching one fish per minute.

986
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,280
His third catch.

987
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,280
He's kept up the one-fish-per-minute
pace until now.

988
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,840
"Three fish"

989
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,600
He caught his fourth one
at five minutes.

990
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,240
- Come on.
- He slows down from here.

991
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,080
It dodged it.

992
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,440
They dodge it.

993
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,640
"Four fish"

994
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,560
That was close.

995
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,760
- It's tough.
- It must be difficult.

996
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,640
He caught his fifth one,
but he only has three minutes left.

997
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,520
However, he picks up his pace
once again.

998
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,560
"Five fish"

999
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,440
His sixth catch.

1000
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,440
That's one quiet battle.

1001
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,400
Yes.

1002
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,520
He's silent.

1003
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,600
There's a lot out there.

1004
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,720
He's taking his time.

1005
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,360
His seventh catch.

1006
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,880
- Amazing
- Looking good.

1007
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,160
Amazing.

1008
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,240
"Seven fish"

1009
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,960
What?

1010
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,680
- His eighth catch.
- Incredible.

1011
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
- I think he's going to do it.
- He can do it.

1012
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,360
He caught three in a minute.

1013
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,280
He has less than a minute left.

1014
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,040
"Eight fish"

1015
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,600
His ninth catch.

1016
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,760
That's amazing.

1017
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,040
Amazing!

1018
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,360
"Nine fish"

1019
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,920
He slows down unhooking the fish.

1020
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,000
Come on!

1021
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,480
He has 30 seconds left.

1022
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,640
It will be his last attempt.

1023
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,120
The Bluespotted Mud Hopper
is positioned lengthways.

1024
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,120
This is the most difficult position.

1025
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Will he succeed?

1026
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,200
"Nine fish"

1027
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,120
He got it.

1028
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,000
He succeeded, with 20 seconds left.

1029
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,480
Amazing.

1030
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,400
Time is up!

1031
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,320
Yes!

1032
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,160
Miyazon successfully mastered
Mutsukake fishing.

1033
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,880
Expert, what did you think?

1034
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,800
Expert?

1035
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,760
He went to see some other people
trying out Mutsukake fishing.

1036
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,400
Congratulations!

1037
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
I did it!

1038
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,880
Will you recognise my skill?

1039
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,240
Yes, I do recognise it.

1040
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,200
Isn't he taking it a bit lightly?

1041
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,480
That's it for Gone Forever's
Mutsukake fishing episode.

1042
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,400
Yay!
