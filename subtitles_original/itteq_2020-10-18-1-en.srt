1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,400
Now, off we go!

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,280
The Quest has started.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,040
Tonight, we have "Imoto Japan Tour"
and the calendar project.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,360
"Ayako Imoto, Tetsuro Degawa,
Daisuke Miyagawa, Asako Ito"

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
"Kazuko Kurosawa, Tomoko Murakami,
Miyuki Oshima"

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,840
This time, I went to Miyagi.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,920
What is your impression of Miyagi,
everyone?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,120
- Beef tongue.
- I'd say beef tongue.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,280
- Masamune Date.
- That's a good one.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,840
- That's typical.
- Yes, that's Miyagi.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,600
So Miyagi is well-known for those,
but the atypical Miyagi...

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,240
I think people usually
don't know this about Miyagi.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm sure there's a lot
we don't know.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,600
Yes, lots of unknown and
unexpected things were uncovered.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,760
We also went ahead
and worked on the calendar project.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
- So that's what you did.
- Yes.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,440
I've had some rare
and special experiences.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,400
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,360
- So this is a Miyagi special?
- Yes, it is.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
This whole episode is about Miyagi.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
- That's incredible.
- All right. Let's get started.

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
The Quest!

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,680
The Quest!

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,920
- Yeah!
- Yes!

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There it is. It's coming.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,640
They're like dolphins.
This is like a dolphin show.

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,920
Wow. It's like they're making
a tunnel.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,120
Now, off we go!

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,960
"Boarding the Blue Impulse
Imoto Miyagi Tour"

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Conquer all 47 prefectures of Japan.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
Rare animal hunter Imoto,
Japan Tour!

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,080
The featured prefecture today
is in central Tohoku region,

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Miyagi prefecture.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,200
- Masamune Date, see?
- Hello.

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,880
Hello, hello. Imoto here.

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,080
I'm currently in Miyagi.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,120
Can you see where I am right now?

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,080
Now, the usual "Where's Imoto?"

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,360
What?

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,560
Near that rock.

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,360
I'm here! I'm right here!

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,520
- I'm here!
- What a colour.

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,800
- The correct answer is a pathway
- What colour is that?

44
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,480
at Miyagi's beautiful Zao Mountains!

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,520
I apologise. I'm being a nuisance.

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,680
Please take a look
at where I am right now.

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
There!

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,240
- Is that real?
- This represents the Zao Mountains.

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,640
This here is the Okama Crater.
It's the vista point.

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
It's pretty intense here.

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
- It has "The Earth" feel.
- It sure does.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,000
This basin was created as a result
of an eruption about 800 years ago.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,520
This is a crater lake created
with rainwater, snowmelt,

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200
and spring water from the mountains.

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
- It's a crater lake?
- It's amazing.

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,560
Its diameter is about 330 metres.

57
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,120
It's a rare terrain
created by nature.

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,640
My impression of Zao is where people
from Asako's generation

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,040
would come to ski.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
- That's what I thought.
- The way you said that...

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,680
There is a specific reason
why we came to Miyagi this time.

62
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
- We'll do the calendar project.
- I see.

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,600
It will be taken
at JASDF Matsushima Airbase

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,240
in Higashi Matsushima, Miyagi.

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,680
This time,
you'll go on-board the Blue Impulse

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,960
to take a wonderful picture.

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm going aboard the Blue Impulse?

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
May of 2020,

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,160
to show appreciation and respect
for all the medical professionals,

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,440
Blue Impulse flew
over the skies of Tokyo.

71
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,760
This is awesome.

72
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Imoto will experience

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
the flight skills
of the Blue Impulse,

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,440
which will be photographed
for the calendar.

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm in shock.

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,920
I thought that was for viewing only.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
No kidding.

78
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,680
- I'm a bit nervous,
- I'd be scared.

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,600
but I'm looking forward
to riding it.

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,240
I'd like to get a good picture.

81
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,040
But before we get to that,
a little report on Miyagi.

82
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Yes, please.

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
A rare animal that's found
at the foothill of Mount Zao.

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,000
This is it.

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,840
Ta-da! It's a fox.

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,480
I didn't know about it at all.

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,640
So Miyagi is known for foxes?

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,360
The zoo director, Sato,
will show us around.

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
I was told
there are lots of foxes here.

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,520
This is the only facility in Japan

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,560
that has foxes
running around freely.

92
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,840
They're running around freely?

93
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,080
Yes, they are. They'll come up
to you, like to here.

94
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,240
Many will come towards you.

95
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
What? They come flocking around you?

96
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,880
Today, they're so happy
that you came, they'll come up here.

97
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
Will they know who I am?

98
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
- They'll know who you are.
- Seriously?

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,840
Yes.

100
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,880
They head
right into the fox village.

101
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,640
They're out here to greet you.

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
- There's a lot here.
- So cute.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,240
We have about 120 foxes

104
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,840
that run freely here.

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
- I just saw something horrible.
- Yes?

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I just saw that sign,

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,440
and it says they bite you a lot
in this area.

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,760
Please move on.

109
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,640
- Do they bite?
- Yes, they do bite.

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
What?

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,440
- Does it hurt?
- You'll go to the hospital.

112
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,760
- What?
- No, no, no.

113
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
If you don't like it, then go...

114
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
- Does that work?
- Then they won't come.

115
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,840
- I got it.
- As long as you don't reach out,

116
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
- they won't bite.
- I got it.

117
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,560
Now, let's take a look

118
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,600
at a fox's characteristics
with Sato.

119
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
First, how they sound.

120
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
Wow! Did you hear that?

121
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
It's almost like a bark.

122
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,800
When they scream like that,
they're giving you a warning.

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
See? They bark like a dog.

124
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
They don't yelp?

125
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,040
They only yelp twice a year,

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,680
when a fox pup is calling
its mother.

127
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,440
A male and female will yelp
during the mating season too.

128
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
The next characteristic is...

129
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,520
Can you tell what they're doing?

130
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,960
What are they doing?
Are they fighting?

131
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,280
- They're fighting.
- Oh, they're fighting.

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,800
They show off their teeth
to one another.

133
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,880
They open their mouth
and show off who has better teeth.

134
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
Foxes threaten one another
by opening their mouths wide open.

135
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,720
Sometimes, a fight could last
longer than an hour.

136
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,000
Foxes don't scuffle.

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,280
They're smarter than humans
because they don't scuffle.

138
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,880
- They don't harm one another?
- No, they don't.

139
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,280
They're smart.

140
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,320
Then...

141
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,280
Oh, they're going at it.

142
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,320
What's going on?

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,320
You said they don't fight,
but they're fighting hard!

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,360
They figured
they're at the same level.

145
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,040
No, they're fighting hard.

146
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
They're still showing off
their teeth, though.

147
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,480
They're showing off their teeth,
but they're going at each other.

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,840
That's something else.

149
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,160
This is no laughing matter.

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,920
That was a scuffle, right?

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,040
That's not a scuffle.

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
No, that's a scuffle.

153
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,160
- Let's gather them around.
- It's too soon.

154
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,920
- Who was that?
- Who is that?

155
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
He's the owner of the fox village
and Mrs Sato's husband.

156
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
When your husband came,
look at what happened to the foxes.

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,960
Who is he?

158
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
Foxes have good hearing.

159
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
- Amazing.
- Therefore,

160
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,360
they recognise the owner immediately
by his footsteps.

161
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,480
That's something else.
All the foxes are gone now.

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
That guy took them with him.

163
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm sorry all the foxes are--

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,400
"Ha ha ha"

165
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,160
He does this all the time.
It's such a problem.

166
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,400
Come.

167
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,520
They get the foxes back with food
to start over.

168
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
However...

169
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
That is not allowed.

170
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
The guests will try to do
the same thing.

171
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,760
That's not allowed.

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
You can't feed them.

173
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm not feeding them!

174
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,160
What's more interesting
than the fox's characteristics

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
is the characteristics
of a married couple.

176
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,760
Imoto and I are...

177
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
Are you listening to me?

178
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,600
We fed them to get a shot of Imoto
and me being surrounded by foxes.

179
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't interrupt!

180
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
You never told me that.

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
Are you two having an argument?

182
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
- We're arguing.
- Are you two showing your teeth?

183
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,080
It couldn't be resolved.

184
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,760
They report their characteristics
at the petting area.

185
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,320
This is Konta.

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
- Look.
- This is Konta. He's 10 years old.

187
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,840
The outstanding characteristic
of a fox is its tail.

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,080
Look how thick his tail is,

189
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,080
but the actual thickness
is like this.

190
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,080
The rest is all fur.

191
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,240
At the top of its tail
is a scent gland.

192
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,120
One theory is that it smells sweet
like violet.

193
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,920
If you rub it and smell it,
then I think you would...

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This part is really...

195
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,200
It stinks!

196
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
It really stinks!

197
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
What is this smell?

198
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,520
Do you want me to smell it?

199
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
That is not that sort of smell.

200
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,440
No, no, no.

201
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
It has a floral scent.

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,280
It smells like violet.

203
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,760
No way. That's a lie.

204
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,680
You're defending the fox too much.
You love them too much.

205
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,720
This really does smell
like a violet.

206
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,400
Now that she said that...

207
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,160
- It smells really good.
- It stinks!

208
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,640
It stinks!

209
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
I don't want this part any more!

210
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,400
What am I going to do?
This part really stinks.

211
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,680
This joint at my index finger
is stinking bad.

212
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,800
Take it back to Tokyo as a souvenir.

213
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,760
No, thank you!

214
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,200
It'll be a nuisance
in the bullet train on my way home.

215
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,840
- Next, Miyagi's beautiful scenery.
- That's so funny.

216
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,280
It's one of the three views
of Japan, Matsushima.

217
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,360
Matsushima is one
of the three scenic views of Japan.

218
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,560
Let's enjoy
the popular aerial tour here.

219
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,040
Yamaya will assist us.

220
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
We'll fly using this motor?

221
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,720
- Yes, we'll use this motor
- There it is.

222
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
and a paraglider to fly in the air.

223
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,440
I've only seen it from the ground.
Would it be different from the sky?

224
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,080
It's completely different.

225
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,320
It's a completely different world
from what you're imagining now.

226
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,920
I can't wait to see this.
I wonder what it's like.

227
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
Let's go!

228
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,680
An aerial tour of Matsushima
in a motored paraglider!

229
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
That's nice.

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
Wow.

231
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,840
It's rapidly rising up in the air.

232
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,520
They quickly rose up to 300 metres.

233
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,160
However, the area
was suddenly covered in clouds.

234
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
That's a little scary.

235
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
- I can't see Matsushima at all.
- That's too scary.

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,800
However...

237
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
This is fantastic
in its own way, though.

238
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,120
You have about 10 days a year

239
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,560
where you can fly
over the sea of clouds.

240
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,040
What? So in a way, I'm lucky.

241
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,160
You've got it.

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,320
For real? Seriously, I've never seen
such a beautiful view like this.

243
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,040
This is strange.

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
This might be more magnificent
than Matsushima.

245
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,960
This is like Nausicaa
or Laputa's world.

246
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,000
Since we're here,

247
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
how about you compose a haiku?

248
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
- Like Basho.
- Yes.

249
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
- That's so sudden.
- Oh, Matsushima

250
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
- They ask you to do that suddenly?
- Where are you, Matsushima?

251
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
- You're right.
- Thank you very much.

252
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,880
- She ended it.
- The aerial view of Matsushima

253
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,520
will be shown later in the footage.

254
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,320
Next, she'll report on
the most unique ruins in the world.

255
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,640
They head to a place
15 minutes away from Sendai Station.

256
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm going to present ruins
right now,

257
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,520
but take a look behind me.

258
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
It's an ordinary residential area.

259
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,320
Hiratsuka, a curator,
will show us around.

260
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,880
Is it really here,
at a place like this?

261
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,520
Actually, this location here

262
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,120
is the ruins
I'm going to show you now.

263
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,120
- Here?
- Yes.

264
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
We did an archaeological survey
in 1987 and 1988.

265
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,320
That's the place I'm taking you to.

266
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,440
- Then, you found it?
- Yes.

267
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,160
What is this valuable ruins
they found 33 years ago?

268
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,320
- It's huge.
- What is it?

269
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,720
What?

270
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,320
I wasn't expecting this at all.

271
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,840
- Is this a tree?
- Yes.

272
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,160
It's a tree from 20,000 years ago
during the Ice Age.

273
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,400
Lots of its roots
are found in this area.

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,600
This is the Tomizawa Site,

275
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,120
where a forest from 20,000 years ago
is preserved.

276
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,960
A tree from 20,000 years ago
remains in shape?

277
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,280
Groundwater is the reason
why these trees were preserved well.

278
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,760
The tree was submerged
in groundwater,

279
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,280
so it wasn't broken down
by microorganisms

280
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,080
and remained underground
for 20,000 years.

281
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,360
And in the forest...

282
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,960
It says "signs of a bonfire."

283
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,400
- Signs of a bonfire?
- Yes.

284
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,280
Back when this area was a forest,

285
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,200
a group of people thought to be
our ancestors were here

286
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,400
- and had a bonfire.
- That's incredible.

287
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I wonder
how those people lived here.

288
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,440
Yes. We may be able to meet them.

289
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,280
- We might be able to meet them?
- That forest

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,880
is recreated around this building.

291
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,920
So I might be able to meet them?

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,760
They recreated the forest
outside of the building.

293
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Then, there...

294
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,440
- Wait, someone is coming.
- What is that?

295
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
Aren't they from the Stone Age?

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
- Hey.
- Hello.

297
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,800
If you're lucky, you can meet
Stone Age people here.

298
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
What is that?
It's like a pole made of wood.

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
They put up a pillar?

300
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,080
Hello.

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,680
What are you doing over there?

302
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,680
What?

303
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,400
- FK.
- FK?

304
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
FK.

305
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,560
They don't understand me.
They don't speak the language.

306
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
I guess they're going hunting?

307
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
I see.

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
There it is. There's a deer.

309
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,800
There's a deer there.

310
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,200
There's a huge deer there.

311
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,080
During that period,
they threw spears with a stone tip

312
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,560
to capture their prey.

313
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,360
- Will he get it?
- That's amazing.

314
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
He threw it. He sucks.

315
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,600
Oh, that was bad.
The deer would have escaped by now.

316
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,600
On top of that--

317
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh, they suck.

318
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
That's too close.

319
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,960
You suck.

320
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,240
This is a weapon made with a stone.
This is quite sharp.

321
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,760
- It's like a knife.
- That's incredible.

322
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,800
They used this to cut things, right?

323
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,200
Wow.

324
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
Incredible.

325
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,560
It's like a utility knife.

326
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,400
Seriously?

327
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,040
- Wow, it's super cool.
- Oh, my.

328
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,680
What they ate besides venison is...

329
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,800
Pine nut.

330
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,160
Pine cones.

331
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,720
Can you eat that?

332
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,920
They're showing it to the camera.

333
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,640
They ate meat, as well as kernels.

334
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,040
Then...

335
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
This is too close.
Being close is not good.

336
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,160
He said, "Being close is not good."

337
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,200
- Being close is not good?
- He's worried about

338
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
being too close to one another.

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Hey, you're too close.
You're too close.

340
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,040
- Is it too close?
- Yes, it's a bit close.

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,000
You should spread apart.
Keep your distance.

342
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,760
- They had that back then too?
- Of course not.

343
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,240
With Corona.

344
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,400
Right.

345
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
Next, a collaboration
with a world-renowned entertainer.

346
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,600
The name is Shiro-A.

347
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
- They're super famous, right?
- What is this Shiro-A?

348
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,200
Shiro-A is an entertainment group
that combines techno sound

349
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,040
with digital images and performance.

350
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,240
Ever since it was formed in 2002,

351
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
they've performed over 500 shows
in 31 countries.

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,000
Tonight, Shiro-A and Imoto
will do a collaboration.

353
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,880
It's an original
The Quest performance.

354
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,240
These are Keisuke Kawashima,
Yohei, and Daiki from Shiro-A.

355
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Are Shiro-A members from Miyagi?

356
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
The original members
are from Miyagi.

357
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,080
There are 18 of us now.

358
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
So the people back there
are also Shiro-A members?

359
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,160
Yes, the video artist,
sound engineer, and the director.

360
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,640
We're able to do a performance
with just us here.

361
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,360
I was told I can do a collaboration
with you today.

362
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,000
I want to liven it up with you all.

363
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,640
They have three hours to practise.

364
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,000
She will do
Shiro-A's notable performances,

365
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,640
as well as The Quest's
collaboration piece.

366
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
I have a lot to learn.

367
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,480
I want to deliver a perfect piece
and enjoy it at the same time.

368
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,960
However,
there's no time to enjoy it.

369
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,560
That's difficult. That's hard.

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
- That's incredible.
- That's a lot of work.

371
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,160
It is a lot of work.

372
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,520
- Where did she go?
- That's hard in such a short time.

373
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
I can't get used to it at all.

374
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,760
I can't miss a beat.

375
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,760
You can't miss a beat.

376
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,120
The images can't be adjusted
no matter what.

377
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,160
- So we need to move to it.
- They need to adjust to that.

378
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,720
I can't see anything from my side.

379
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,200
That makes it harder.

380
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,520
Please take a look.

381
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,800
Shiro-A with Imoto,
the special performance starts!

382
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
Go for it.

383
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,840
The opening act is a gorgeous
dance performance by Shiro-A.

384
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
That's wonderful.

385
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,920
That's amazing.

386
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,240
Imoto is about to appear.

387
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
There she is.

388
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,600
There she is.

389
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
"Imoto"

390
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,680
She's on-beat.

391
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,920
- Looking good.
- Amazing.

392
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,280
Amazing.

393
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
Amazing.

394
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,560
It's coming back.

395
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
There's Imoto.

396
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,440
It was a close-to-perfect
performance up to this point.

397
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,840
Now, the dance move advances.

398
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,840
Go for it!

399
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,040
That's why Imoto is on standby.

400
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,360
"Imoto"

401
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,880
Now, Imoto will make
her appearance again.

402
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,880
Go for it.

403
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,480
- Looking good.
- Looking good.

404
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,880
It's incredible.

405
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,120
- Wow. Amazing.
- It's amazing.

406
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,120
Next is the Movie Catcher.

407
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
- What?
- That looks hard.

408
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,760
Imoto can't see the image,

409
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,320
so she'll have to move
with the timing as she was taught.

410
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,560
That's something else.

411
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,960
- That's fast.
- This is no joke.

412
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
This is scary.

413
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,880
- Amazing.
- Amazing.

414
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,880
You can't be off.

415
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,440
The last performance is Box,

416
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,560
a popular performance
that uses nine boxes.

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,680
This is The Quest's
original version.

418
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,920
You learned it well.

419
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,800
It's like a slot machine.

420
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,840
- Oh?
- I...

421
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,840
- Mo...
- Mo...

422
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,680
- To.
- To.

423
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,280
Imoto can't see the images
in this performance either.

424
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,720
If you miss the timing
and the order to hit the box,

425
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,440
it won't work as a show.

426
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm glad.

427
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Asako.

428
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
There's Asako.

429
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,640
Amazing.

430
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
What was that?

431
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
They're bouncing it.

432
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,480
Asako is all over the place.

433
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
What is that?

434
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Interesting.

435
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,400
This is incredible.

436
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,360
Morisanchu.

437
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
Amazing.

438
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,600
The back screen is utilised well
to deliver this great performance.

439
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,200
This must be difficult.

440
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,520
What a timing.

441
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,040
This is fun!

442
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
- Amazing.
- Amazing.

443
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,680
It's so interesting.

444
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,720
Amazing.

445
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
"Ro-To-I-Shi-Ra-A-Bo-Ko-Mo"

446
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,120
What?

447
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,640
- Imoto, Shiro-A Collaboration.
- Amazing.

448
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
- Oh, could that be?
- Oh?

449
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,720
It's coming.

450
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,640
It's amazing.

451
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,920
No way!

452
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,680
Another one.

453
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,240
- This is great.
- Amazing.

454
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,160
How could they remember all that?

455
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,360
Shall I eat you?

456
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,480
They performed well.

457
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,760
Amazing.

458
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,320
That was great!

459
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
I had fun doing it.

460
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,240
I think The Quest collaboration
was fun for the viewers too.

461
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,440
Because of the current situation,

462
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,080
you can't perform live
with an audience,

463
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,680
- but you hold online events.
- Yes.

464
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,960
So please go and check them out.

465
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,320
Thank you very much.

466
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,240
Finally, a calendar photo shoot
in the Blue Impulse!

467
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
Now, to take care of the main event,

468
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,560
let's head over
to JASDF Matsushima Airbase.

469
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,480
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

470
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
This person who greeted us is...

471
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,960
Blue Impulse's 13th captain,

472
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,480
- ASDF Lt. Col. Yuki Ento.
- Amazing.

473
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,000
I was told that you were flying

474
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,120
the Blue Impulse
that flew over Tokyo?

475
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,320
Yes, I was flying the first plane
as the flight leader.

476
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,560
I was watching it in Tokyo.

477
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,480
- I was so touched.
- That's incredible.

478
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Thank you very much.

479
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,000
29th of May, 2020.

480
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,320
Blue Impulse flew
over the skies of Tokyo.

481
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,040
Captain Ento was taking the lead

482
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,600
- of the formation.
- Captain.

483
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,800
What exactly is the Blue Impulse?

484
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,520
Matsushima Airbase's 11th Flight
Training Wing is the official name.

485
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,360
We call it Blue Impulse,
by its nickname.

486
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,520
It's an aerobatic team.

487
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,440
I see.

488
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,720
The squadron was formed in 1960.

489
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,960
They do aerobatic performances
during national events,

490
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,920
major events, or at an air festival.

491
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,160
This is cool.

492
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,880
They promoted the existence of JASDF
in and outside of Japan.

493
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,960
I was told
that I'm able to go on it?

494
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,280
By the way, can civilians...

495
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,040
It's not very common.

496
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,680
Only the famous people who've gone
to the top will go on it

497
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,840
to promote it to the world.

498
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,480
That's a major responsibility
for me.

499
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,720
If you could just do
your job well...

500
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,360
No, but...

501
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,160
Now, let's go see Blue Impulse.

502
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,120
Wow, there's a lot here!

503
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,680
It's full of Blue Impulse.
Are these all Blue Impulse?

504
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,800
Isn't it a great view?

505
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,240
- Wow, it's so cool.
- Amazing.

506
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
- It's amazing.
- It's incredible.

507
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,600
I like the blue and the white.

508
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,880
And at half past 6 in the morning,

509
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,520
- How did we manage to get it?
- every day at this time,

510
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,920
the Blue Impulse training starts.

511
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,440
It's like an opening.

512
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,760
- It's like a theatre.
- Yes, like curtains are rising.

513
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,960
Blue Impulse is cool.

514
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,880
It's like an athlete
of the airplane industry.

515
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,160
It has absolutely no body fat.
It has a trim body.

516
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,080
It's 13 metres in length.

517
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,120
It's a specialised
aero-acrobatic plane,

518
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Blue Impulse T-4.

519
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,400
It's an all domestically-made
jet airplane, including its engines.

520
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,760
Its fastest speed
is 1,000 kilometres per hour.

521
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,920
What is this?

522
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,200
You know how Blue Impulse smokes
during a performance?

523
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,760
- Yes.
- This is where it comes out of.

524
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
- What? It's this small?
- Yes.

525
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,520
In here is a clear oil.

526
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,080
It instantly vaporises with the heat
to produce smoke.

527
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,880
And it looks like white smoke
to our eyes?

528
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,480
- That's how it works.
- She'll board inside the cockpit.

529
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,480
- That's amazing.
- It's tight in here.

530
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
It's super tight in here.

531
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,040
It really is a cockpit.

532
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,800
That index finger
is the switch for the smoke.

533
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,000
While that's pushed,
it's constantly going.

534
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,000
It stops when you let it go.

535
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,760
This is nice.

536
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
- Do you want it now?
- I want it.

537
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
Do you think I could get it
if I try hard?

538
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,640
I think so. It's 2.3 billion yen.

539
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,680
I can't do it.

540
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,600
You've gone to the top, you know.

541
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,280
They always have a briefing session
before their training.

542
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,240
We will check the weather now.

543
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,560
- Current wind, 0807 knots.
- So cool.

544
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,560
What's important here is to go over
the weather condition with everyone.

545
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,760
They have to get a grasp
of the wind direction

546
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,000
and the temperature
and utilise that in flight.

547
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
In addition, they have
several other matters they go over,

548
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,080
such as accidents that happened
in the past on that day.

549
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,880
What a cool meeting.

550
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,320
I think this may be
the coolest meeting in the world.

551
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,280
Have you ever said "abort mission"
in a meeting?

552
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
When you think about it,

553
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,840
entertainment industry lingo
is lame.

554
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,120
You know, lingo for "midnight"
and "mark" onstage.

555
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,760
I think I might stop using
those terms now.

556
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,000
I think saying "start time" is lame.
I'll say "entry" from now on.

557
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,680
My entry is at half past 1
in the afternoon.

558
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,040
They're going to have
a flight training,

559
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,480
so we'll be able to show you all
amazing acrobatic aerial acts.

560
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,520
Let's watch
the Blue Impulse's aerial training.

561
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,640
Amazing!

562
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,960
The take-off is a highlight too.

563
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,720
It's a low-angle Cuban take-off
where they just fly off the runway.

564
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
- That's amazing.
- It's incredible.

565
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,080
Incredible.

566
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,040
Look how close it is.

567
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
It's coming.

568
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,080
Amazing.

569
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,400
It's incredible!

570
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,760
One jet is coming.

571
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,680
Wow! That's perfect!

572
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,560
Wow. It's turned over!

573
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,880
It's incredible.

574
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
It's coming again.

575
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,160
Wow, it's rolling.

576
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,200
"Inverted and continuous roll"

577
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,680
Wow!

578
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,520
"Level opener"

579
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,400
Blue Impulse's pilots
are the best of their kind.

580
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
They're able to fly
several fighter planes,

581
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,600
and only the most skilful flyers
are assigned to the team.

582
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,680
Amazing.

583
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,120
They're rolling.

584
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,800
"Inverted roll"

585
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,920
They're like dolphins.
This is like a dolphin show.

586
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
There it is.

587
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,320
They fly in a straight line while
the plane is positioned at an angle.

588
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
This is called
the double knife edge.

589
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
"Double knife edge"

590
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,640
Amazing!

591
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,120
I see them coming
from the right and the left.

592
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,000
Opposite continuous roll is where
they cross paths at a close range.

593
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,000
"Opposite continuous roll"

594
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,240
A little imprecision,
and they will crash head-on.

595
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,360
And the last one is a power move,

596
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
the corkscrew.

597
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,120
It's coming.

598
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,320
Wow!

599
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,120
It's like they're making a tunnel.

600
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
- This is incredible.
- What is this?

601
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
- Amazing.
- And inside that loop...

602
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,320
Wow, amazing!

603
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,960
The G-force must be no joke
right now.

604
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,200
What a fantastic show.

605
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,800
Did you see any tricks
you wanted to do?

606
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,040
For now...

607
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,280
I didn't want to try
any of those tricks.

608
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,240
I prefer to watch those tricks.

609
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
They returned safely
after a 40-minute training session.

610
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,720
I enjoyed watching it.
I had the best seat.

611
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,880
- It was wonderful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

612
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,840
What did you think
of Blue Impulse's performance?

613
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,360
It was super fast.

614
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,840
I'm planning to have you undergo
training before you go on-board.

615
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,480
- What? Training?
- Yes.

616
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,480
That's right.
You can't just go on it that easily.

617
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,680
They need to gain knowledge
and skills to deal with the G-force

618
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
that's experienced inside the plane.

619
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,000
However,
Imoto is magnificently experienced.

620
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,400
Captain, I've been doing
some hectic things abroad

621
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
for this show.

622
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,760
G-force too.

623
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,520
If you think I'm qualified,
then let me know.

624
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,760
- Yes, I will consider it.
- Yes, please consider it.

625
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,160
She's talking about the wing walking
she tried in the United States.

626
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,800
The G-force and wind pressure
felt on the body are extraordinary.

627
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,120
- This is no joke.
- This is incredible.

628
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Will she be able to bypass
the training with this?

629
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,000
This is me.

630
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,920
It's flying very slowly.

631
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,600
No, it was super fast.

632
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,760
If it's at this speed,
this jet will crash.

633
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,720
It will stall.

634
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,920
- Seriously?
- Yes.

635
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,360
Then, how about the one in England
where she did a flip?

636
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,480
He should be happy about this one.

637
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,840
How about this one?

638
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,240
I see.

639
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,040
The G-force here was no joke.

640
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,840
- It seems that way.
- Yes, it is.

641
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,320
But you were able to raise your hand
with this G-force.

642
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
I worked really hard for it.

643
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,760
I think this is no comparison.

644
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,040
- For real?
- Yes.

645
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,640
- This won't do.
- That's amazing.

646
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,360
There's no way for her
to avoid this training.

647
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,280
I see.

648
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,440
The training will be done
at Hamamatsu Base in Shizuoka.

649
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
- Shizuoka?
- At a different location?

650
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,040
So then...

651
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,920
We're here now at JASDF
Hamamatsu Airbase in Shizuoka.

652
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm standing in front of their gate.

653
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,880
Here, they study
aviation physiology,

654
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,480
- as well as other knowledge
- It's a classroom.

655
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760
required to go on-board
a fighter jet.

656
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,000
She has a name card too.

657
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,080
The most important knowledge

658
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,040
is the breathing method
while enduring the G-force.

659
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,160
At JASDF,
we recommend hook breathing.

660
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,800
You say "hook" and do it
in three-second increments.

661
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,920
Hook.

662
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
When you utter the K,
you breathe out at the same time.

663
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Once you're done breathing out,
take a breath in right away.

664
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,840
Hook.

665
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,800
- Hook.
- Amazing.

666
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,920
It actually makes me suffer more.

667
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,200
- They also watch scary videos.
- What is it?

668
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
What? Hook breathing?

669
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,800
It's not done properly.
He's not completely breathing out.

670
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,160
If they can't do the hook breathing,

671
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,160
they may pass out
due to the G-force.

672
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,080
Are you okay?

673
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Oh, no.

674
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,400
Matsumoto.

675
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,400
Matsumoto.

676
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
He can't hear any more.

677
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,040
- Can you hear me? Are you okay?
- Yes.

678
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,560
He's not okay.

679
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,400
I didn't want to watch that.

680
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
That's terrifying.

681
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,960
Well, you might actually
consider that as fun.

682
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,960
No, that's not fun at all.

683
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,480
In addition, inside one
of the three special rooms in Japan,

684
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
they undergo low pressure training.

685
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,680
Oh, this should be okay for her.

686
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,680
This room is at an elevation
of 7,500 metres right now.

687
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
They have women in there too.

688
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,840
They take their oxygen mask off

689
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,320
to check to see if their brain
is functioning properly.

690
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,360
- However, Imoto has climbed Manaslu
- She's fine on this one.

691
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,600
- at an elevation of 8,163 metres.
- She has experience.

692
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,600
As a result...

693
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,320
I've got a certificate to show

694
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,160
that I've completed
the low pressure training.

695
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,960
- It's valid until 2025.
- Was this the connection?

696
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,600
I can go on it for a while.

697
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,920
Let's go on the Blue Impulse
and share how cool it is.

698
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,360
Imoto is finally going on-board
the Blue Impulse.

699
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,000
This time, I'd like to get
a great photo and a video

700
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,080
of me riding the Blue Impulse.

701
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,040
It's also for the calendar project.

702
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,960
You got it.

703
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,000
First, I need you to decide

704
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,680
- which jet plane you want to board.
- What?

705
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,920
- I can choose?
- Yes.

706
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
As you know, there are six jets.

707
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,440
Blue Impulse
has a total of six jets.

708
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,960
Each jet has a different role
and flight technique.

709
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,760
You can choose it by their face too.

710
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,680
Their face?

711
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,200
Each pilot has
their own characteristics.

712
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,960
- What? I can decide like that?
- That's what he meant?

713
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,960
Yes.

714
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,880
So, off to an interview
with the pilots.

715
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,520
Captain, I'm curious
about one thing.

716
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,320
- Should I not mention it?
- Go ahead.

717
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,600
He's one of the members.

718
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,760
He's alive, right?

719
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,760
Yes, of course.

720
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
Don't be alarmed.

721
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,000
He was at his wife's side
when she delivered their baby.

722
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,080
I hope they have a healthy baby.

723
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm glad.

724
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,800
For this,
it will be a four-jet flight.

725
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,040
However, depending on which jet
Imoto chooses out of the six,

726
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,360
their moves and formation
will change.

727
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,960
Now, let's introduce the pilots
and each jet's functions.

728
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,880
Thank you.

729
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,640
There are three pilots
in the first jet taking the lead.

730
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,280
The first jet is in command
of all the members as the leader

731
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,240
and flies at the lead
of the formation.

732
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,120
The safety of all the pilots
is the priority during flight,

733
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,600
and so, this is the only jet
Imoto won't be able to go on.

734
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,840
So we asked about the TAC name,
the pilot's nickname.

735
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
By the way, what is yours, Ento?

736
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,360
- It's Cherry.
- It's Cherry?

737
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,320
- I'm originally from Yamagata.
- I see.

738
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,760
It's known for cherries.

739
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,560
What a great reason.

740
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,080
How about this "Jackie" for you,
Hirakawa?

741
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,360
I sort of look like Jackie Chen.

742
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,800
- I see.
- "Chen."

743
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,200
Gon...

744
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,120
I love Gon Nakayama from Shizuoka.

745
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Oh, so this "Gon"
is from Gon Nakayama?

746
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,480
So the paperwork I received says
that a senior member said,

747
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,240
"You look like a primitive man."

748
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,880
- So this isn't it?
- That's it too.

749
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,760
Both of them are right.

750
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,600
When I try to make it short,
I mention Nakayama.

751
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,680
What's with that pattern?

752
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,120
That's the reason?

753
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,640
Next, the third jet pilots

754
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,000
are Yusuke Kubo
and Takaharu Onitsuka.

755
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,920
The third jet's function is to be
on the right side of the first jet.

756
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,040
We maintain the symmetry
of formation with the second jet.

757
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,720
We watch the first and second jets
to join the formation.

758
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,640
We have to be upside down

759
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,240
- while we approach the first jet.
- That'd be incredible.

760
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,400
It's so close that you think
you'd crash into it.

761
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
- So it's quite aggressive?
- Yes, it is.

762
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,080
I sort of like the third jet too.

763
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,240
Next, the fourth jet's pilot
is Kota Nagaoka.

764
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,960
I didn't notice it earlier,

765
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,760
but when I look up close,
you have a nice face.

766
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,880
You have a wonderful face.

767
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,240
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

768
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,160
Not at all.

769
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,520
The fourth jet is usually
at the rear of the formation.

770
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,480
- Okay.
- This might be interesting.

771
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,720
So that's the best place
to see Blue Impulse?

772
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,320
You can watch Blue Impulse
while enjoying all the moves.

773
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,920
The fourth jet might have
the best view.

774
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,640
- You're exactly right.
- It might be the case.

775
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,560
The pilot for the fifth jet
is Moritoshi Kawano.

776
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,880
Gabai. Gabai.

777
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,360
The fifth jet's position
is called the lead solo.

778
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,320
Lead solo?

779
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,520
It's in charge
of a solo flight performance.

780
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,280
That's the position.

781
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,240
So would it be the jet that does
the most acrobatic moves?

782
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,840
It rolls by itself
and does this on its own.

783
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,840
I see.

784
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,000
It's Blue Impulse's star position.

785
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,200
The solo acrobatic flight
has many highlights,

786
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,000
and the world's best flight
techniques could be experienced.

787
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,200
It would rise up rapidly
and roll around really fast.

788
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,360
You'll sweat your head off.

789
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,200
That sounds terrifying.

790
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,160
Pilots for the sixth jet are
Takahiro Sato and Naritaka Manabe.

791
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,280
I think the fifth jet's pilot,
Gabai, mentioned it.

792
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,640
Our two jets perform together.

793
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,440
So the fifth and the sixth jets
specialise in acrobatic moves?

794
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,640
The sixth jet's biggest highlight
is this spiral move,

795
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,080
in a corkscrew.

796
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,320
This is something else.

797
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,560
It's like constantly spinning
in 5G-force.

798
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,320
5G-force?

799
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,360
It actually feels nice
when you're experiencing it.

800
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,160
No, no, no.

801
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,520
Please choose jet number six.

802
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,920
No way!

803
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm sorry. Not today.

804
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,840
- Which jet did Imoto choose?
- They all looked interesting.

805
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,480
I'll share my decision.

806
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,720
The jet I'm thinking
of boarding is...

807
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,800
- jet number four with Nagaoka!
- Yes!

808
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,880
After all that,
she chose based on his looks.

809
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,080
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. I'm counting on you.

810
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,520
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you very much.

811
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
The fact that you mentioned

812
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:27,560
how you can watch the three jets
while in flight...

813
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,080
I really wanted

814
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,480
- to see that view this time.
- I want to see it too.

815
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,840
Please enjoy the flight
on Blue Impulse.

816
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,240
Yes. I want to enjoy it.

817
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,360
I think I can enjoy
the view as well.

818
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,160
A final meeting before boarding.

819
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,080
Attention.

820
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,680
- Salute.
- Thank you.

821
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,880
Today, we'll be flying Blue Impulse
with four jets.

822
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
This is the meeting.

823
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,520
30th of September.
Call sign. Blue Impulse.

824
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Take-off is "individual normal."

825
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,240
Come up into the air individually
in increments.

826
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,720
I see birds here and there
out there.

827
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,400
We will change the altitude
as needed.

828
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
Go up in 07, then make a right turn.
250 knots at 1,000 feet.

829
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,000
I think we don't have to worry
about the clouds right now.

830
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,400
But if you notice something,
just let us know, Gabai.

831
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,320
Tommy, you're basically
on weather check.

832
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,240
Yes.

833
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,560
Imoto, do you have any concerns?

834
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,640
So it's delta roll wide
and Opotra Lolicon?

835
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
That's exactly it.

836
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,320
Got it.

837
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,360
You took down lots of notes.
What did you write down?

838
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,640
Birds are here and there.

839
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,400
Now, the moment
we've been waiting for.

840
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,880
This is an opportunity.

841
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,280
It's not like you can pay for it
to go on the Blue Impulse.

842
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm really lucky
to be able to go on it.

843
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,960
Salute to the mechanics.

844
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
Salute.

845
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,680
Thank you.

846
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,800
Your life depends on them.

847
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,800
They prepare to board.

848
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,960
It's so tight.

849
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,080
From this moment onwards,
this seat and I are one.

850
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
In worst case scenario,

851
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,360
I'll be ejected out of here
with this seat.

852
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,160
Which one shouldn't you touch?

853
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,320
This one.

854
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,160
Isn't it tempting to touch there?

855
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,040
They especially made this helmet
for Imoto for this day.

856
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,560
I'll do my best.

857
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,440
I'll go enjoy it.

858
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,440
Captain Ento's jet number one
in the lead will head to the runway.

859
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,920
They cheer for Imoto,

860
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
who will also be taking off
into the air.

861
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,400
They did the Q sign for The Quest.

862
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm able to board this thing,
thanks to so many people.

863
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
This is also part of the promotion
for JASDF,

864
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,600
plus for enjoyment.

865
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,640
I'll make this flight

866
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,680
so that the viewers will have fun
watching it above them.

867
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,400
She finally takes off into the sky
with the Blue Impulse.

868
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,080
All right, shall we get going?

869
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,760
- Yes, finally! Let's go!
- Yes!

870
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,280
- Let's have fun!
- Let's be energetic!

871
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,640
Jet engine is on.

872
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,800
Amazing.

873
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,000
Take-off.

874
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,120
- It's so cool.
- It's so cool.

875
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,360
The first jet took off just now.

876
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,080
Go for it!

877
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,480
- We're heading up.
- Yes, please!

878
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,520
- Okay.
- And they're off.

879
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,040
Let's go!

880
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,960
Number four jet, take off!

881
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,840
- We're going up.
- Yes.

882
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,000
It just took off.

883
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,680
Amazing.

884
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
Wow!

885
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,960
We're approaching the two jets
to the left-front of us.

886
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,720
Wow!

887
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,640
Amazing.

888
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,320
We can get this close to them?

889
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,080
The two jet planes

890
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,840
- are right in front of us.
- Oh, man.

891
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,560
It's flying right in front of me.

892
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,480
Amazing.

893
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
- What a view.
- It's amazing.

894
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
- It's amazing.
- What is this?

895
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,080
And what started
to appear below is...

896
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,960
I see Matsushima

897
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,720
- that I couldn't see the other day.
- It's Matsushima.

898
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,320
Matsushima is clearly seen today.

899
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,280
Matsushima, 20 kilometres away
from the base,

900
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,320
- is only a two-minute flight.
- Low altitude is amazing.

901
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,120
The speed
is 800 kilometres per hour.

902
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,600
They keep the jets
within 5 metres of one another.

903
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,920
They're so close.

904
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,600
This is the flight technique
of Blue Impulse,

905
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,920
the best in the world.

906
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Amazing.

907
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,120
Imoto, a final check.
How is your physical condition?

908
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm fine.

909
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
"Ready"

910
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,160
They maintain a high speed
while turning to the right.

911
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,240
They maintain the same angle.

912
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,280
It's totally different
from a regular airplane.

913
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,920
The sensation of just sitting here
in the Blue Impulse now

914
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
is completely different
from a regular airplane.

915
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,120
It's speed, for one,

916
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
but I feel it all over my body.

917
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,680
Now, they release the smoke!

918
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,520
It's completely different.

919
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,760
Three jets are releasing smoke
right now.

920
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,680
Oh, they're releasing smoke
right now.

921
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,200
It's amazing.

922
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,560
Amazing.

923
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,320
Now, the three jets
will fly in formation.

924
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
- I'll approach them.
- Yes.

925
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,200
I sense G-force when we turn.

926
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,480
"One smoke"

927
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
Smoke is being released.

928
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,080
This is an echelon formation.

929
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,040
Okay.

930
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,440
It's a diagonal formation
with jet number one taking the lead.

931
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,560
This is an echelon formation.

932
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,280
That is so cool.

933
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,480
It's so close.

934
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,000
The jets are so close
to one another.

935
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,160
Imoto, how are you feeling?

936
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,640
- I'm fine.
- Yeah!

937
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,520
Lots of clouds are seen this day,

938
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,640
but the peak of the blue sky,
the ground full of greenery,

939
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,520
and the body of the Blue Impulse

940
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,240
shine beautifully
against the backdrop.

941
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,920
Right now, we keep our distance
visually to fly.

942
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
You can see the town clearly below.

943
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,640
Cherry...

944
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,360
It's very pretty.

945
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,240
Ash, is Imoto okay?

946
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,080
- She's fine.
- Okay.

947
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,520
Now, we'll start applying G-force.

948
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,840
Now, the acrobatic part is starting.

949
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,720
G-force is being applied.

950
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,200
Four jets form a diamond shape,
a 360 horizontal turn.

951
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,480
It's a diamond 360.

952
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Now, it's 3G-force.

953
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,400
3G-force?

954
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,080
On. This is 3G-force.

955
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,840
Wow, 3G-force.

956
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,280
It seems elegant,

957
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,160
but inside the jet
is a harsh G-force.

958
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,520
This is incredible.

959
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,480
Wow, hold on!

960
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,560
- Hold on.
- Yes.

961
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,640
Now, we'll flip.

962
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,800
- I'm going to do two moves.
- Yes.

963
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,920
Here we go!

964
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,120
We'll be turning to the right.

965
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,760
Ready...

966
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
There.

967
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,200
Ready... There.

968
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,200
The body of the jet doesn't budge
at all. It's a magnificent turn.

969
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,440
Okay!

970
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,800
How was it?

971
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,080
Amazing.

972
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,000
How was it?

973
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,720
It's something else, but I'm okay.

974
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,400
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

975
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,560
Now that she's okay,
here's the real deal!

976
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,320
Now, we'll flip!

977
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,560
Yes, we're flipping!

978
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,160
This is double farvel,
where jet one and four are flipped.

979
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,520
- Okay, let's go.
- There they go.

980
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,640
- Okay, let's go.
- There they go.

981
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm upside down!

982
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,240
- Let's go.
- There they go.

983
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm upside down!

984
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,800
What an incredible situation.

985
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,560
I'm going to approach them.

986
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,880
He's approaching them
while being flipped.

987
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,920
They close in quickly where
they can almost touch one another.

988
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,560
He's approaching them
while being flipped.

989
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,320
That's close! That's close!

990
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,880
"Recover, ready"

991
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,520
Okay.

992
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,680
Okay.

993
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,200
- That's amazing.
- It's incredible.

994
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,200
It's impressive.

995
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,600
- It's amazing.
- It's amazing.

996
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
Right turn.

997
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,560
- We'll do one more move.
- Okay.

998
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,720
The next one is the last move.

999
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,600
The finale
is Blue Impulse's signature move

1000
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,760
that's been handed down
for generations.

1001
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,800
- It's the falling combat pitch.
- Ready.

1002
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,360
"One smoke"

1003
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,120
- It's going to start now.
- Okay, it's starting.

1004
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,720
There will be some G-force,
so hang on tight.

1005
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,280
Thank you!

1006
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,960
Please watch for
the rhythmical moves of the jets

1007
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,800
and the smoke that forms lines
behind them.

1008
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,840
I'm going to turn right.

1009
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,760
Wow!

1010
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,080
Amazing!

1011
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,920
Amazing.

1012
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,240
With the turn and a sudden fall,
she's feeling the maximum 4G-force.

1013
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
- Amazing.
- 4G-force?

1014
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,920
Imoto finished a 40-minute flight.

1015
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,160
Blue Impulse is cool.

1016
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,120
I'm so happy. I'm the first woman
to ride the Blue Impulse.

1017
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,040
You know, as a civilian.

1018
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,920
And the aerial view of...

1019
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,200
That was Matsushima, right?

1020
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,760
Yes, that was Matsushima.

1021
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,160
I didn't get any view from the sky
the other day,

1022
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,640
so I got to see it clearly today.

1023
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,080
I was so shocked to see how it was.
It was gorgeous from above.

1024
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,680
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1025
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,960
I really had a great time.

1026
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,760
He told me everything,
like what's going to happen next.

1027
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,480
Ash gets motion sickness easily too.

1028
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,520
He said that since he gets
motion sickness easily,

1029
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,680
he was determined to fly it
so that we don't get sick.

1030
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,560
He flew it gently
for a Blue Impulse.

1031
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,160
I was truly grateful for that.

1032
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,000
- Captain, thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

1033
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,280
It was very valuable. I am honoured.

1034
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,200
- I'm glad.
- Honestly.

1035
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,240
I actually wanted to go higher
and be more aggressive,

1036
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,640
but because of the clouds...

1037
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,680
- Well, maybe some other time.
- Right.

1038
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,960
- Something wilder.
- You can do a lot more, right?

1039
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,080
Thank you very much.
It was a great experience.

1040
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Thank you.

1041
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,400
And for the calendar,
it's this shot!

1042
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,840
That's it for Japan Tour.
Miyagi has been conquered.

1043
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,800
That was wonderful.

1044
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,040
I've done G-force experiments

1045
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,560
with NASA before.

1046
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
What's impressive about Imoto

1047
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,880
is that she does an interview
like it's nothing

1048
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,080
right after the flight.

1049
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,640
It's unthinkable.

1050
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,360
You know, you're the Tom Cruise
of The Quest.

1051
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,240
No, not at all.

1052
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,760
You climb mountains.

1053
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,520
- You rock climb as well.
- Impressive.

1054
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,920
You make "Mission: Impossible"
possible.

1055
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,360
No, no.
