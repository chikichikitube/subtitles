1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,520
"The Quest"

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,480
"This programme was first broadcast
14 February, 2021"

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,680
The Quest has started! We have rare
animal hunter Imoto's Japan tour,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,080
and Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000
"Asako Ito, Daisuke Miyagawa,
Ayako Imoto, Tetsuro Degawa"

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,920
"Kazuko Kurosawa, Miyuki Oshima
Soichi Nakaoka, Tomoko Murakami"

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,160
That doesn't look good.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,480
"A local competition and
a major experiment in Ehime"

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,920
Three, two, one, go!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,480
"Lotti Nakaoka's QTube in Hokkaido"
"Funny clips in the extreme cold"

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,800
Stop it!

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,640
It's freezing.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,760
Conquer all 47 prefectures of Japan!

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
Rare animal hunter Imoto's
tour of Japan.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,440
She went to west Shikoku,
known for its Dogo Hot Springs.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
- Hello, it's Imoto!
- Shimanami Kaido is pretty.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm here in Ehime.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Now, where am I?

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,560
- Time for our usual "Find Imoto."
- Where is she?

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm here!

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
I'm right here.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm being part of a stone monument,
next to this particular house.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,320
Someone famous actually lived
in this house.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,360
Miyagawa! Do you know who it is?

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,680
I guess a hint would be this statue,
and the ambience here.

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,920
- So do you know who it is?
- Who is that?

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,400
- What? Wait!
- Wrong!

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,800
You're completely wrong! Of course
it's not Kinjiro Ninomiya.

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
The correct answer is...
a major writer of the Meiji era...

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,160
- this is Shiki Masaoka's home.
- So it's Shiki Masaoka.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,480
Shiki Masaoka was born
in Matsuyama, Ehime.

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,400
He set the foundation for
modern Japanese literature,

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
and everyone has heard of his Haiku,

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
"Eat a persimmon/
And the bell will toll/At Horyuji"

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,800
This is Ms Yamazawa, a haiku poet
who specialises in Shiki Masaoka.

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
So you're a poet?

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,120
- Yes, I am.
- Not an invalid, but a poet?

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,280
- So you're a haiku poet?
- Yes.

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,880
Since we are here
at Shiki Masaoka's house,

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,600
how about conversing
solely in Haiku form?

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Won't that be hard?

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,960
There's a possibility
I won't say a word.

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
- Let's start!
- Wait a second!

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,440
Shall we go and view
Masaoka's house?

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,360
Yes, we should.
Let's head on inside.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,080
This is so awkward to think
after every turn,

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,880
and this conversation
is so meaningless.

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,840
Now, let's learn about
Shiki Masaoka!

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,320
I see. It is much smaller
than I expected.

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,720
You're right. Only part of it
has been restored.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
- I see.
- What about the Haikus?

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
In any case,

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,560
is it okay for me to go inside?

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Yes, of course. You can go in
with your shoes on.

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
What?

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,480
It's too much work to come up
with a Haiku response.

58
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,640
I have seen Masaoka's picture...

59
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,960
in textbooks before.

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,120
You're right. His profile picture
is very common.

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,680
This photograph was taken
in the latter part of his life.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,480
It was hard for him to straighten
his spine due to a chronic illness,

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,680
so they took
a profile picture of him.

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,880
And Shiki Masaoka was in love
with a particular sport.

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,440
- Shiki loved baseball.
- I see.

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,200
Shiki translated "walk"
as "four-ball."

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,640
These baseball terminologies,
still being used now,

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,600
were created by Shiki Masaoka
based on their English wording.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
What is Shiki's position
in baseball?

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,640
Shiki's position in baseball is...

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
catcher.

72
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,120
I see.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,760
A catcher...?

74
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,800
It is not acceptable for a person
to give incorrect info in Haiku...

75
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
about Shiki Masaoka.

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
Ms Yamazawa,

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,920
you've done your research.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
I can't say anything wrong--

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,000
Hold on a second.

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,640
This is so wrong.

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
What am I going to do?

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,600
Am I...

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,320
going to be okay after this?

84
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Yamazawa deeply respects this other
person besides Shiki Masaoka.

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,560
Ms Yamazawa, do you have
a Haiku master?

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,640
My master is Itsuki Natsui.

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
What?

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,120
The person who gives such strict
assessments in the Haiku show?

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,520
I hope Ms Natsui doesn't watch
this part.

90
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,240
I hope so too.

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,200
Let's start the Ehime Japan tour!

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,680
First, let's go to Ehime!

93
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,640
I think we all envision tangerines
when we think of Ehime.

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,640
Ehime is the foremost producer
of citrus fruits in Japan.

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,600
There are over 900 different
varieties of citrus fruits.

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,040
This Nakate tangerine
has different varieties as well.

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
Does it taste different?

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,080
This variety is called
"Nankan 20-go."

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,600
So this is Citrus Unshu,
Nakate tangerine's Nankan 20-go?

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,440
- This is called "Sumo Citrus."
- Sumo citrus is tasty.

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,960
It's actually
a variety called "Shiranui."

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
The product name is "Sumo citrus."

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,600
So it's like a real name
and a stage name.

104
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,600
- It's Shiranui in the mountains.
- Shiranui.

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Once it's in town,
it's called the Sumo citrus.

106
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,000
When she's in Hokkaido,
she's called Kana Sasamori.

107
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
When she's in Tokyo, she's Barbie.
Is it like that?

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,200
Now, please take a look
at this book I have here.

109
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,200
It's called "Funny Ways to Peel
A Tangerine."

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,000
It's something you do while
you sit around a kotatsu.

111
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,440
It looks like fun. I like it.

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,160
Now, please have a look at
funny ways to peel a tangerine.

113
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Ken Hirai's song.

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
"A caterpillar tangerine"

115
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
That's cute.

116
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,920
"Twinkling star tangerine"

117
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
That's cute too.

118
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,720
They did a lot there.

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,520
"A bracelet tangerine"

120
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,160
That's amazing.

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
"A ring tangerine"

122
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,800
That's cute too.

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,720
"A microphone tangerine"

124
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,680
That's cute.

125
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,000
"A basket tangerine"

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
How cute.

127
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
"A flower tangerine"

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,520
- I think that's cute.
- It's cute.

129
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,680
"A watch tangerine"

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,760
"A wood block tangerine"

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,680
"An earring tangerine"

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,560
- She's got a lot there.
- She's wearing them all.

133
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
Next, it's Ehime's local contest.

134
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,360
They've gone to Uwa Rice Museum.

135
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,440
They relocated and reconstructed
a former primary school.

136
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,680
We have a corridor-cleaning race.

137
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
A corridor-cleaning race?

138
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,120
They call it Z-1 Grand Prix!

139
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,480
A tourist did a corridor cleaning
race once, and it became popular.

140
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,000
And we, the youth league of commerce
and industry, made it into an event.

141
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,040
- So it started with a tourist?
- Yes.

142
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,040
This is the longest corridor in
an existing wooden school building.

143
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
This corridor is really something.

144
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,080
Its total length is 109 metres long.

145
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,440
- 109 metres?
- 109 metres?

146
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,760
100 metres are used for the contest
to see who's the fastest cleaner.

147
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,760
It's not just simple cleaning.
There's a lot more to it.

148
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Is my form good?

149
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
You should make several adjustments.

150
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't push with your hands
flat on the floor,

151
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,600
just touch it
with your fingertips.

152
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,200
When you touch it with your
fingertips, you get less friction.

153
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
When it comes to this,
it's not about cleaning here.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,960
When you're cleaning, you want
to push with your hands flat,

155
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
and use that friction
to clean the floor.

156
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,960
If you lift up your hips,
you can move forward more smoothly.

157
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,440
I see.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,360
And the most important advice is...

159
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,320
It's very long,

160
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,280
so never raise your face.

161
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
You will be discouraged.

162
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,000
I know. It's so long.

163
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,320
She will be competing against
Hiyori Sadayoshi,

164
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,560
the 2019 champion
in the female division.

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm a bit worried.

166
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm a little concerned
since Imoto seems strong,

167
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
from climbing mountains and stuff.

168
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,680
I think this is a great opportunity,
so I'm going to give it my all,

169
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,880
and defeat her.

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,760
Imoto, this is your chance to teach
failure to a middle schooler!

171
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,800
Ready...

172
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
- Both of them have a clean start.
- Looking good.

173
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,840
- She's good.
- Amazing.

174
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,640
- Go! Go!
- You can do it!

175
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
- Looking good.
- Amazing.

176
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,320
It's a close contest.

177
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,480
- It's a close competition!
- Amazing.

178
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,320
The second half of the race
determines the winner.

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,520
- Go! Go!
- She's going for it!

180
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
She's really going for it!

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,280
But now Imoto's feet start to trip.

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,000
- 100 metres is long.
- Go for it!

183
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,840
- Ah!
- That's incredible.

184
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,240
She put up a fight, but this
35-year-old lacked the endurance.

185
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
She's laughing.

186
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
She's laughing hard.

187
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,360
Darn it! I'm so annoyed!

188
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,000
That final 20 to 30 metres...

189
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,880
I would say so.

190
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,800
Around there,
this area was clearly...

191
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,440
I mean, my mind wanted
to move forward,

192
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,920
but my legs wouldn't.

193
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,960
I get that.

194
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
No, you don't get it.

195
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,280
You won't get it.

196
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,280
- Do you want to go again?
- I do not!

197
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
If we do it again,
you'll have an easier win!

198
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,640
However, we found another
local event just like this one!

199
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,920
The event is held
at a harbour town in Masaki.

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,720
We have an H-1 Grand Prix here.

201
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,280
So we had a Z-1, and now
we have an H-1?

202
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes, it's H-1.

203
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
Hangiri race, H-1 Grand Prix.

204
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,040
Hangiri is a barrel for making miso
and sake, that's cut in half.

205
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,800
During the Edo period in Masaki,
people rode in these to go fishing.

206
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,560
This is a traditional race...

207
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,200
that started 50 years ago,
to maintain the tradition.

208
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,160
Imoto will compete against locals
in this event.

209
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,880
- She will be instructed by...
- She's very cute.

210
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Yuri Kochi, a world record holder
of Hangiri.

211
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,240
What are you currently studying
at the university?

212
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,160
It involves carrying on Hangiri
and other kinds of old traditions.

213
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
This is incredible.

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Kochi is beaming.
She's looking directly at me,

215
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,480
as if she's cheering me on
for this event.

216
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,560
I would like to match
your expectations.

217
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,160
- I'll do my best. Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm ready, Kochi!

219
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,680
There are no tools involved
in this race.

220
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,800
You just use the Hangiri, or barrel,
to move forward.

221
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,600
For real?

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Is that how it's done?

223
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
That's incredible.

224
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
It's a series of endless squats,
using the whole body.

225
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Incredible.

226
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,480
Please cool down first.

227
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,400
Even a world record holder
is this fatigued.

228
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,800
That doesn't look good.

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,800
It's totally different
from what I had in mind.

230
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Your arms stay straight and firm.

231
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,800
You bend your knees
and push out at the same time.

232
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,480
When you lean forward, the water
is pushed, making it move forward.

233
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,880
With that in mind,
here's the exhibition race.

234
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,440
How far will she go
against experienced participants?

235
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,880
I'm regretting now that I should
have taught you the rhythm...

236
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
by being at your side
during practise.

237
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,480
- You're regretting it?
- Yes.

238
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,920
- I see, I see.
- I haven't taught you everything.

239
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
- I'm really sorry about that.
- It's fine.

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,280
I think with your physical strength
and energy, you'll win at the end.

241
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
Yes, I got it.

242
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,000
I think Kochi
is an endangered species.

243
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,400
Have you ever met
such a nice, innocent girl?

244
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,200
Kochi taught Imoto alongside her.

245
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,560
Your elbows are bent.

246
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,760
You're getting tired,
and your knees...

247
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,920
Bend and stretch! You can do it!

248
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,080
She is so nice and innocent,
Imoto can't slack off at all.

249
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,520
Kochi and the pressure
she put on me...

250
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,360
Sincere pressure...

251
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
is exhausting.

252
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,120
So this is done at sea?

253
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,080
Yes, so if the waves come
from the side...

254
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,200
- it can affect your position.
- Right.

255
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,680
If the waves come from the front,
you can't move forward at all.

256
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm sure.

257
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,640
You can't move forward?

258
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,360
But when you overcome that,
the goal is right there.

259
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,320
She's seriously so positive.

260
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,840
Now, it's time for the race.

261
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,440
Ready.

262
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,880
Set...

263
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Go!

264
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,040
Go!

265
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,400
Go for it!

266
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,160
She's matching
the local competitors.

267
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,360
Squat more! Add more power!

268
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
Please squat a little more!

269
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,560
Ms Miyazaki in the outer course
goes off the grid.

270
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,480
Look forward! Squat a little more!

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,040
Squat! Squat!
A little faster! Faster!

272
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Kochi is shouting out
encouragement!

273
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,560
Squat! Squat! With power!
Squat with power! You can do it!

274
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,000
However, she ended up
in second place.

275
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,880
The hardest placement to react to.

276
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
This is no joke.

277
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,120
That was a great effort.

278
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,080
About halfway through the race,

279
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,560
I knew I would place second.

280
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,400
I would just finish,

281
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
with no highlights whatsoever.

282
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,920
I thought about falling out halfway,
or going around in circles,

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,640
and thought maybe I should dive in,
but Kochi was in front of me...

284
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,520
going, "You got it!"

285
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,440
When I saw her eyes,
I had no option but to continue.

286
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,360
The fact that I was able to do it
with her will be a lifelong memory.

287
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,280
- She's such a good girl.
- She's such a good girl.

288
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
- I'm so happy.
- Thank you.

289
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm so glad you feel that way.

290
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,800
When I see you on TV now,
I'll go, "Oh! I've met her!"

291
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,640
Wait. This is not good.

292
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,920
What am I going to do about that?
It's going to be tough from now on.

293
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,960
What am I going to do
after hearing her say that?

294
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,440
When I come in contact
with someone so genuine,

295
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,440
then I notice more
of my wickedness,

296
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,400
and I feel ashamed of myself.

297
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
For some reason, I couldn't look
directly into Kochi's eyes.

298
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,840
I'll do my best to be that person
you were happy to work with...

299
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,240
- when you see me on TV.
- Yes.

300
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,280
- Please stay the way you are.
- Yes.

301
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
Please.

302
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Next is a major experiment
done in Ehime.

303
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm in Shikokuchuo City.

304
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,880
This town manufactures the most
paper and paper products in Japan.

305
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,480
All the paper products other than
stamps and money are made here.

306
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,400
It's said to be the leading producer
in Japan.

307
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,200
Let's learn a bit about
paper products first.

308
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
This is Mr Ohashi
who's in research.

309
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
We have different
coloured papers here.

310
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,280
This paper won't dissolve in water.

311
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,880
These are commonly used around us.

312
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,920
What do you think it is, Degawa?

313
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
- What?
- It won't melt in water?

314
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,520
It has to be litmus paper.

315
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,760
The correct answer is...

316
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,280
tags for dry cleaners.

317
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,320
People usually think that these
are put on after cleaning.

318
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,720
- I thought so too.
- Right?

319
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,320
It's recorded before it's washed,

320
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,320
and it's washed after the tag
is put on.

321
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
- But it won't fall apart.
- It won't.

322
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,440
It's made by a local company here.

323
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,080
I'll be thinking about it now
when I have my clothes cleaned.

324
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,920
I'll think of Shikokuchuo City.

325
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,840
In addition...

326
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,920
- This thin paper...
- It's thin. It's like a tissue.

327
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,880
This is paper made
from a plant called Abaca.

328
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,160
It's thinner and lighter
than tissue paper,

329
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
but it's unbelievably durable.

330
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
Amazing.

331
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,400
When Imoto, who weighs 50kg,
hangs from it...

332
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
look at that!

333
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,800
Since it's so durable,
it's also used for monetary notes.

334
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,720
An experiment to be carried out
in this paper town is...

335
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,200
Do you know what a popgun is?

336
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,360
Popgun? Isn't that the one where
you make a sound with a flyer?

337
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,680
- Here.
- Ah! I remember this!

338
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,840
I used to make them!

339
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Many of you probably played
with these when you were children.

340
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,120
It's called a popgun since it makes
a pop when it's swung down.

341
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
The vibration that occurs
when air enters the pocket,

342
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
is the cause of the popping sound.

343
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,600
We will make a gigantic one
and see how loud it is.

344
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,240
Will the sound be louder
if the popgun is bigger?

345
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
I wonder if it's going to create
an explosive sound?

346
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,160
It will be done in collaboration
with Maruyoshi paper.

347
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,200
What's the biggest size paper
you make here?

348
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,920
Paper made with this machine
has a width of three metres.

349
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,080
Do you think we can make
a gigantic popgun?

350
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,600
I think we can make it.

351
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,240
Will it pop or not?

352
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,280
- We've never made one, so...
- It's hard to tell.

353
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,840
It requires strength and pliability.

354
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,000
They will make it with paper
used for wrapping paper.

355
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,640
This is our project leader,
Mr Yamauchi.

356
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,360
Shall we try it with paper
as big as this room?

357
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
This room?

358
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,280
The anticipated size
is 13 metres by 9 metres.

359
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,400
They will attach three sheets
together to create one huge piece.

360
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
They will tape them together.

361
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,880
Now, it's done!

362
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,800
It's huge! I think it's about
the same size as a volleyball court.

363
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,600
We have to use our whole body
to fold it.

364
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
It's hard work to fold one part.

365
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
They spend about an hour
and a half...

366
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,920
to get to the final step
to create this gigantic popgun.

367
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,320
Amazing!

368
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,440
There!

369
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,200
A little forward.
Let me pull it a bit.

370
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,920
The gigantic popgun is made.

371
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,560
It's an isosceles triangle
with a base of 6.5 metres.

372
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,520
I'm actually quite moved.

373
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,640
- We still have an experiment to do.
- Right.

374
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,600
This machine will be used
to swing the paper.

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,120
The popgun will be attached to this.

376
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
- This is the set up.
- Three, two, one.

377
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,960
Go!

378
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,800
- It made a sound just now.
- It did! It did.

379
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,280
I feel like it's going to work.

380
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,040
It's about whether it opens or not.

381
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,520
And it's a bit windy today.

382
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
The wind...

383
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,360
The day was windy,
with the wind blowing at 7m.

384
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,800
It's like the size of a boat,

385
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
so it's affected by the wind.

386
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
I see.

387
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,880
There's confusion whenever
something gigantic is involved.

388
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,240
Oh?

389
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,160
- It's the opposite, right?
- Opposite?

390
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
- Okay, rotate it.
- It's this way.

391
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,600
Wait a second.

392
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,040
This is where we hold it,

393
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,840
so this should be taken to the base.

394
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,600
The paper popgun is in the shape
of an isosceles triangle.

395
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,880
It's confusing to figure out
which side to attach to the machine.

396
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,560
Hold on.

397
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,920
- That's not it! I'm sorry!
- This isn't it?

398
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,680
We put the grip in the wrong place.

399
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,160
What?

400
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,160
- So this thing is wrong?
- This thing is wrong.

401
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,760
- No way!
- Oh no.

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
This side opens up.

403
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,560
- No, it's right.
- It's right?

404
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,480
Is it right?

405
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,280
- This part opens up.
- That's cute.

406
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
So this part does open.

407
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,440
This is the base, so it's all good.

408
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,160
- That's great!
- That's great!

409
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,080
Mr Yamauchi got it
the wrong way around.

410
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
- It's a triangle, so...
- I know.

411
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,000
- Oh?
- I'm glad.

412
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,520
Will it make a popping sound?

413
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,840
They attach the paper popgun
to the machine.

414
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,720
- It's hitting it. Wait!
- Be careful!

415
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,800
I want this to be successful.

416
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,440
Now, the gigantic paper popgun
experiment, first attempt.

417
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,160
They use a pendulum swing
with a weight of 100kg for this.

418
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,400
Ready!

419
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,400
- Three, two, one, zero!
- Go!

420
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,880
Go! Go! Go!

421
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
Oh no...

422
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
- It didn't open.
- It didn't open.

423
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,600
The wind from the side twisted it
before the pocket opened.

424
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
It didn't have much momentum either.

425
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,080
It went up slowly.
I was expecting it to be faster.

426
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,800
Shall we add on a pulling force
from the opposite side?

427
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,440
- From the opposite side?
- Its weight slows it down...

428
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
so to accelerate it, maybe
we can pull it from the other side?

429
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
Is that done by the men?

430
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,120
Yes, it's done by the men.

431
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,400
Adjusting the machine and replacing
the popgun takes an hour each time.

432
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,760
Three, two, one, zero!

433
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
Go! Go!

434
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,360
Ah!

435
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,800
The initial speed was faster,
but the wind made it flap.

436
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,080
This side now?

437
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,000
So when the weight came down,

438
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,120
it had accelerated when it reached
the bottom,

439
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
but it seemed to slow down
from there.

440
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,280
- I think so.
- He's right.

441
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,400
From this point,
we need another push.

442
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
Without this part, I think it'll be
the same thing all over again.

443
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,400
Now they plan to have the men pull
throughout the whole process.

444
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,560
Three, two, one, zero!

445
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,320
Go! Go! Go!

446
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,480
Its speed increased.

447
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,960
Its rotation was bigger,
but it still won't open.

448
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,200
I think this is the limit, right?

449
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,040
Yes, I think so.

450
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
I wonder if we could
do something about it.

451
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,080
Can't we get it to open?

452
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,200
As long as the pocket won't open,
it won't make any popping sound.

453
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,240
What else can they do?

454
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,200
They continued with the experiment
the following day.

455
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,760
They tried several
different methods,

456
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,560
but the results were the same.

457
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
Zero!

458
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,000
- Go! Go! Go!
- It's looking good!

459
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,920
It looked so close.

460
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,880
All the men on site seem exhausted.

461
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,920
The sun is about to set soon.

462
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
The sun is about to set.

463
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,840
You're right.

464
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,920
For two days,
they had nothing to show.

465
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,760
This is probably the final attempt.

466
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,600
This is our last chance!

467
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,440
I hope it's successful!

468
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,840
Let's go!

469
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,600
Three, two, one, zero!

470
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,560
- Go!
- It's fast!

471
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,080
It opened up!

472
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,840
We did it! We did it!

473
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
"We did it"?

474
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,160
- That last one...
- I think we did it!

475
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,120
Zero!

476
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,360
No matter how hard we listen
to it, it didn't make any sound.

477
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,520
However, since the popgun
opened for the first time,

478
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,840
everyone on site seemed to have
a happy-ending vibe.

479
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,320
We did it!

480
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
- I think we did it!
- We did it!

481
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,680
They're cheering!

482
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,560
It didn't rip.

483
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,240
- It didn't rip.
- It opened up without ripping.

484
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960
Just as we planned.

485
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,560
"Just as we planned"?

486
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
The project is to see whether
this popgun will pop.

487
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
It's not whether the popgun
will open up.

488
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,000
Do you mean this is a grand failure?

489
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,840
What?

490
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,280
What?

491
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
However, I have no regrets.

492
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,960
You don't?

493
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,520
- Do you have regrets?
- To finish...

494
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,440
we tried different ways
of folding it,

495
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,240
so I would like to place it
down here.

496
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,760
- The paper, I see.
- Then...

497
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,480
I would like you to get
an aerial shot of it,

498
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,480
with a drone.

499
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,000
- As a memento.
- Oh, a memento.

500
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,360
Are you fine in terms of the popgun?

501
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,160
I'm satisfied about the popgun.

502
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,600
- I have no regrets about it.
- You have no regrets. Okay.

503
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,320
So here's the shot.

504
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,400
When you make a gigantic popgun.
The paper will open up,

505
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,600
but it won't make any sound.

506
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,800
Now, the 11th prefecture,
Ehime is done!

507
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,360
That was a huge experiment.

508
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,080
But didn't you realise it wouldn't
make a sound by the first day?

509
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,600
You know that's not going to make
a clean popping sound!

510
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,480
You knew that's not going to pop.

511
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,720
When you got that aerial shot with
the drone, it was already dark out.

512
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,400
It's not time for that tune.

513
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,040
That music was turned off.

514
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
What did you think, Tetsuro?

515
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,000
I want Kochi
as one of my Degawa girls.

516
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,960
Everyone on site loved her too!

517
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,560
When they did the first check
after the first edit,

518
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,200
the director's love for Kochi
was so strong,

519
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,880
that everyone was like
"What is this video for?"

520
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
What are we showing here?

521
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,200
- Kochi's segment was long.
- They were like, "What is this?"

522
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,920
- He was in love with her?
- He was in love with her.

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,440
They had the camera on Kochi
the whole time.

524
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,920
The world is full of YouTubers who
create and post interesting videos.

525
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,160
This project goes
on location with them,

526
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,160
to create a video to make
the whole world laugh.

527
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,760
This is...

528
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,440
QTube.

529
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
He headed to Hokkaido in midwinter.

530
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,880
Let's start with QTube! First up
is activities in extreme cold.

531
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,040
We found an activity like no other.

532
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
It's called the blizzard experience.

533
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,240
It recreates a blizzard using
a snowplough and a gigantic fan.

534
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,360
Will he be able to stand it
for five minutes?

535
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,240
Do they all enjoy it
for five minutes?

536
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,640
Some of them enjoy it,
and some of them give up.

537
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,160
I'll show you the longest one.

538
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,560
I'll do it for eight minutes.

539
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,320
How long will Nakaoka endure it?

540
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Start the fan!

541
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,600
First, they will start off
by using a shovel.

542
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,120
It's quite painful when the flakes
of snow hit him.

543
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,280
Ah!

544
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,720
Nakaoka is enduring it.

545
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,560
Now, the snowplough is mobilised.

546
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,040
It's a fierce blizzard.

547
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,080
The temperature created
is minus 30 degrees Celsius.

548
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,320
I'm dying here!

549
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,600
No! This is impossible!

550
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,120
Next is a popular performance video.

551
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Nakaoka paints with ink using a mop.

552
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,440
Here I go!

553
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,680
Ha!

554
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,800
That was fast.

555
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,480
Isn't it too fast for that
to happen?

556
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,640
Mountain! Mountain!

557
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,920
It's cold!

558
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,160
He paints wildly for 30 seconds.

559
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,960
This screams failure...

560
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,680
so loudly.

561
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,640
It's impossible to paint well. Once
Nakaoka realises this, his aim is...

562
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,120
Just make it happen.
Make a miracle happen.

563
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,040
...to have some kind of a laugh.

564
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
How about I press my face onto here?

565
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,040
Last resort, a face-printing plan.

566
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Is it on?

567
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Make it funny! Make it funny! Yes!

568
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,440
There's nothing funny about that!

569
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,400
Oh no, there's nothing
funny about this.

570
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,600
There's nothing funny about this.

571
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,200
Next up is an action video
using computer graphics.

572
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,600
Nakaoka moves instantly.

573
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,640
How do we make it happen?

574
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,640
As long as you flip at the top.

575
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,480
As long as I flip at the top?

576
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,080
Then the CG will take care
of the rest.

577
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,760
Just flip at the top? I mean,
is that even possible?

578
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,200
First, he'll use a balance ball
to practise.

579
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,040
It will be filmed from an angle
where the ball can't be seen.

580
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,600
Where do you want
to travel to instantly?

581
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,880
Well... to a warm hot spring.

582
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,440
Will Nakaoka be able to travel
to a hot spring instantly?

583
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm about to travel instantly!

584
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Yoo hoo!

585
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,760
Ouch.

586
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,960
He slipped and fell.

587
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Darn it!

588
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,560
This bit is slippery.

589
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,960
This is the main area
I have to step on, too.

590
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,400
I'll have to do it barefoot.

591
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Maybe it'll work if I'm barefoot.

592
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,000
Another attempt with bare feet.

593
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
Let's go!

594
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
There!

595
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,360
It's a success!

596
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,920
Wasn't that good?

597
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,200
- It's so cold!
- That's amazing.

598
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,840
Nakaoka, now we'll get
the landing part too.

599
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,080
No, no, no.

600
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,000
I need a hot spring.

601
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,520
You travelled there instantly,
just now, right?

602
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,360
No, no. I didn't actually go.

603
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,040
Next is an experimental video
using static electricity.

604
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,640
For this, Nakaoka will build up
static electricity,

605
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,680
and touch a florescent light
to see if it will light up.

606
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,520
It's not shining.

607
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,240
However, since the process
is so simple,

608
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,560
please watch it in a story format
created and directed by Nakaoka.

609
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,240
A static electricity yokai
makes its appearance.

610
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,480
Once upon a time,

611
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,560
there was a yokai
who loved static electricity.

612
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,600
Hey, girls...

613
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,120
Give me static electricity.

614
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,560
The yokai summoned young women
on a nightly basis,

615
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,400
and made them rub PVC pipes...

616
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,960
to generate static electricity.

617
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,120
Let me see.

618
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,360
This is great static electricity.

619
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,440
All right, you two...

620
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,640
Generate more static electricity.

621
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,200
What he loved to do was
to light up a florescent light bulb,

622
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,520
using static electricity.

623
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,040
Three,

624
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,600
two, one...

625
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,800
and...

626
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,160
- It lit up!
- It lit up.

627
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
It lit just now, right?

628
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,200
It was faint, but it did light up.

629
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Today's static electricity...

630
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,520
was 100 watts.

631
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,600
What is this?

632
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,160
- Next is extreme-cold funny videos.
- What is this?

633
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
He will be supported by a partner
to go as close...

634
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
as possible to the water surface,
and get back up.

635
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,640
This attempt is done
at a frozen fishing pond.

636
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's a success if he can use
his mouth to get that marshmallow.

637
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,240
Transparency, zero.

638
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,640
Omori, the camera assistant
will be his partner.

639
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,160
Trust challenge, start!

640
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,240
Nakaoka must trust Omori,

641
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
and put himself in Omori's hands.

642
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,520
It's fine. It's fine.

643
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,280
- It's fine. It's not fine.
- I'm bent at the waist.

644
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,360
Nakaoka is hesitant and ends up
bending at his hips.

645
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
He won't be able to reach
the marshmallow that way.

646
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
- Scold me not to bend my body!
- Okay.

647
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Let's do this.

648
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,800
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

649
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,920
It's fine. No! don't bend!

650
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,200
It's such a horrible challenge,
but this is making me laugh.

651
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,480
Another attempt.

652
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,240
- Ready.
- Yes.

653
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
Okay.

654
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Don't bend! Don't bend!

655
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,280
- You're doing it!
- Amazing!

656
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,240
You're doing it!

657
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,640
The marshmallow is getting closer.

658
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
However...

659
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
You're touching it already.

660
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,760
The front of his body
is directly in the water.

661
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,600
Wait.

662
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
I'm in the water.

663
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,120
Lower my head!

664
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,040
No!

665
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,920
No!

666
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,400
Lift me back up once.

667
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,960
Lift me back up.

668
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,080
Omori is out of energy
and is unable to lift him back up.

669
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,280
Get me up!

670
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,360
This is enough of a penalty already!

671
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,200
Are you kidding me?

672
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,320
When I ask you to get me up,

673
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,120
then someone else should help too.

674
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,240
They rush over to the sauna.

675
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,800
They have one?

676
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,160
Hey!

677
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
Why is he running ahead of me?

678
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,280
Hey! Wait, darn it!

679
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,720
Hey! I get that this is hard.

680
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
But we should go in together...

681
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,120
at a time like this.

682
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,000
And why...

683
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
are you sitting in the only chair?

684
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,520
Next up, popular videos
from around the world.

685
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,120
Mr Kimura, an associate professor at
Hokkaido University, will assist us.

686
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,560
Let's start the experiment.

687
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,040
We set up a freezer at
a temperature of minus 25 degrees.

688
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,840
Water is sprayed onto his hair
to slowly freeze the hair.

689
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,600
It's already hard?

690
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,120
It is hard.

691
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,960
We even have a secret weapon.

692
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,120
Associate Professor Kimura,
what is that?

693
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,520
Super cooled water.

694
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,560
- Super cooled water?
- I'm thinking of making it.

695
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,400
Super cooled water is cooled
below zero degrees Celsius.

696
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,400
It instantly freezes with
the right stimulus.

697
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,120
This will be used to create icicles
in a short period of time.

698
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,880
I hear a dripping sound.

699
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,040
The water is still flowing
right now.

700
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,640
What? It's flowing?

701
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,880
Yes, it is.

702
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,840
- Associate Professor Kimura?
- Is there something wrong?

703
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,360
It's dripping down,

704
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,440
and the back of my knees are wet.
I don't like this at all.

705
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,080
With Associate Professor Kimura's
earlier simulation,

706
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,640
it went well.

707
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
This is not good.

708
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,680
- It was a failure this day.
- Oh no.

709
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,840
As a result, they continued
to mist his hair for an hour,

710
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,960
and Nakaoka was finally released.

711
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,760
It's nice and warm.

712
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,520
This is not good at all for my hair.

713
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,760
How do you expect me to go home?

714
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,360
You know...

715
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,600
It's going to break.

716
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,680
Next, a low budget video.

717
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,560
Just like the
pulling-off-the-tablecloth trick,

718
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,640
he'll pull the cutting board out
and get the eggs into the cups.

719
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,440
The cutting board didn't have
these bumps on there before.

720
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,080
Stuff like this bothers me.

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,520
Nakaoka will attempt to get
five eggs into five cups.

722
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,760
It's super hard.

723
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,600
This cutting board
is not stable at all.

724
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
The fact that it's tilted that way,
ah!

725
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,400
Boiled eggs.

726
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,920
They're boiled.

727
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,000
The cutting board is warped.

728
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
I know, right?

729
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,600
- We have other cutting boards.
- You do? Hold on.

730
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,440
You gave me
the messed up one first?

731
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,400
Is this how it goes?

732
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,440
- That's what it is?
- This is then...

733
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,320
- You can pour stuff into the pot.
- I see.

734
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,240
This is great. Can I have it?

735
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,960
He'll try again using
a regular cutting board.

736
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
This one is so much more stable.

737
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,400
Here I go.

738
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,520
Go for it!

739
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,440
Three,

740
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,880
two,

741
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,720
one! There!

742
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,120
- They went in!
- Success in one go!

743
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,760
Amazing!

744
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,840
I did it! It was so clean too!

745
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,800
- That was great.
- I haven't been successful lately.

746
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,680
It's been a while...

747
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,640
since I've felt this accomplished.

748
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
Next up are silly videos.

749
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,360
He will collaborate with
world champion tap dancers.

750
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,640
Nakaoka will learn
from them remotely,

751
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,520
and practise upper body moves.

752
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,800
How did it end up looking?

753
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,320
Surprisingly, Nakaoka is pretty
good with his upper body movements.

754
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,600
That's good.

755
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,200
"Seconds to miraculous
synchronisation"

756
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Perfect!

757
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,040
That was perfect!

758
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,000
Next, an extreme-cold video.

759
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,400
His challenge is...

760
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
Bouldering?

761
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,880
He'll attempt to see if he can last
for a minute and a half.

762
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,880
However, the difficulty level
increases every 10 seconds.

763
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,600
It has different levels.

764
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,760
When it's on zero,
it doesn't move fast.

765
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,440
As we raise it up,
it will move with your weight.

766
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,920
That's an interesting set up.

767
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,200
Let's do it.

768
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,520
Oh, and if you grab an orange rock,
you'll get zapped.

769
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,640
No way! Stop that!

770
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Nakaoka, bouldering in extreme cold.

771
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,560
Ready...

772
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,240
- Start!
- That looks scary.

773
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,520
Okay.

774
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,680
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

775
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,400
- I can do this.
- Looking good.

776
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,160
I can do this.

777
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,040
The wall increases its speed
every 10 seconds.

778
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,520
Ah! There's the orange one!

779
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,160
The orange ones are out.
That's a problem.

780
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,760
- Be careful!
- Okay, it's here.

781
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,360
Now, the speed increases even more.

782
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,200
There are more orange rocks too.

783
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,640
There's another orange one.

784
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,000
Don't be scared of the orange ones.

785
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,760
There are too many orange ones!

786
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,080
It's deeper than I thought!

787
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,400
Pull me out! Pull me out!
Please pull me out!

788
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,360
Pull me out! Don't pull me anymore.

789
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,320
It's too cold! It's too fast!

790
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,760
What do you mean 30 seconds?

791
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,400
- How did it look?
- How many times did we see that?

792
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,120
- It looked like you could do it.
- You thought so?

793
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,840
I won't be fooled by such words.

794
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,440
If anything, we have wetsuits too.

795
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,680
Oh?

796
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
What?

797
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,360
Why didn't you say that
at the start?

798
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
For his second attempt,
he's geared up in a wetsuit.

799
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,240
- Ready, go!
- Will he succeed this time?

800
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,320
Go for it!

801
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,680
Looking good!

802
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,080
You can do it.

803
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,920
Go for it!

804
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,960
Ten seconds.

805
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,720
Looking good.

806
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
- Okay.
- Go for it!

807
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,680
The zapping rock appears.

808
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,400
He barely manages to avoid it.

809
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,720
Looking good.

810
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,040
- Amazing.
- Just one more minute.

811
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,120
- Thirty seconds.
- Ouch!

812
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Ouch!

813
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,480
Nakaoka gives up here.

814
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Wow!

815
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,960
How many seconds was that?

816
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
- That was 30 seconds.
- Thirty seconds!

817
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
This is no joke.

818
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,160
A zap followed by this cold is...

819
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,120
no joke.

820
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,920
You've never done it before, right?

821
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,600
Human being.

822
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,480
The final clip is Nakaoka's idea
and it's done in Nagano.

823
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,320
I thought of doing
different challenges,

824
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,680
with things I'm good at.

825
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,560
Do you know what I'm good at?

826
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,600
Hockey.

827
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,880
Nakaoka was played for Nara
when he was in secondary school.

828
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,480
This is Nakaoka's proud speciality.

829
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,240
He'll attempt to catch balls
with a hockey stick.

830
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,520
In addition...

831
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,160
- Nakaoka!
- Hello!

832
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,880
What?

833
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,800
This is Sakura Japan,
a team that represents Japan.

834
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,040
They've competed in the Olympics
five consecutive times.

835
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,280
At the world championships in 2018,
they beat New Zealand,

836
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,960
who rank fourth in the world.

837
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,600
This team is expected to do well
at the Tokyo Olympics.

838
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,200
We will do a collaboration
with their major players.

839
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Sakura Japan at their training camp
and Nakaoka will connect remotely,

840
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,840
and aim for everyone to succeed
in a relay format.

841
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,240
Let's do it!

842
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,480
Once again, Nakaoka takes the lead
with his leadership style.

843
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,680
The surface of the stick is rounded
and is therefore unstable.

844
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,680
Oh?

845
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,680
So it's hard to catch the ball.

846
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,400
Oh!

847
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,920
The same goes for Sakura Japan
as well.

848
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,720
There's added pressure of doing it
in a relay, and they fail.

849
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,160
It was your idea to do this, but...

850
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,320
It's kind of a failure.

851
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,520
If players representing Japan
can't do it, then it's impossible.

852
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,800
The terrifying thought of it
being shut down enters his mind...

853
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,000
However, we have a backup plan.

854
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Wow.

855
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
I didn't like it
when I saw this before,

856
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
but it'll be helpful.

857
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,800
This machine...

858
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,320
has been altered now.

859
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,000
It's a PET bottle rocket
with a powder remote.

860
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,160
This is helpful. Thanks.

861
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,120
Let's do this!

862
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,840
Sakura Japan has 30 more minutes
for this task.

863
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,480
Nakaoka will be the anchor of
the six players passing the ball,

864
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,800
and the rocket on Nakaoka's back
will launch no matter who messes up.

865
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Oh no, I'm seriously nervous here.

866
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,440
I'd feel so bad if I mess up.

867
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
Let's get this done...

868
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,280
in one go!

869
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,360
Yes!

870
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,600
Let's show off hockey...

871
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,520
to Japan!

872
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,280
Yes!

873
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,680
Let's do this!

874
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,120
- Please start!
- They're all hyped up to start!

875
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,080
"Yu Asai"

876
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,640
"Yukai Mano"

877
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,440
However, something unexpected
happens with Nakaoka...

878
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,760
What?

879
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
- Oh no!
- Ah!

880
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,800
The wind blew so hard
that he didn't get powdered.

881
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Oh no!

882
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,120
This may not make it on air!

883
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,000
And unfortunate events continue
for Nakaoka.

884
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,440
Okay. Okay.

885
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,480
Okay.

886
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,720
Oh? It stopped.

887
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,400
Their connection got worse.

888
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,800
Their computer shut down.

889
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Their time is almost up.

890
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,920
Nakaoka is under the greatest
pressure he's ever experienced.

891
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,040
Please don't edit out this segment.

892
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,240
They are back online,
but this is their final attempt.

893
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,240
Go for it!

894
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,600
- Ready!
- Let's go!

895
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,960
Let's do this!

896
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
Will they succeed?

897
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,920
Go for it!

898
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,960
Sakura Japan continue to practise
during the equipment failure.

899
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,320
They smoothly connect the ball.

900
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,560
- Okay! You can do it!
- They are so cool.

901
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,360
Stay calm! Okay!

902
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,880
"Yuri Nagai"

903
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,920
Five players succeed.

904
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,680
Then it's passed to Nakaoka.

905
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,160
- Okay!
- You can do it!

906
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
You can do it! It'll happen.

907
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,720
Sakura Japan, watch this!

908
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,640
Yes!

909
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,200
Nakaoka manages to succeed
miraculously at the very end!

910
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,320
Yes!

911
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,840
I did it! Yes! Yes!

912
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Did you see that?

913
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,000
- Amazing!
- Did you see it?

914
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,440
Did you see that?

915
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,760
I'm so glad.

916
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,760
Now this might make it
onto the show.

917
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,400
That's it for Lotti Nakaoka's QTube.

918
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,080
"QTube, the end"

919
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,960
We see more of Nakaoka's leadership
when we see him in person.

920
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,360
Today, Nakaoka's leadership
was on the weaker side.

921
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,520
When it's done remotely,
it's on the weaker side.

922
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,520
It's revealed that it doesn't work
that well when it's remotely done.

923
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,640
What? You said it was gross,

924
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,240
but now you're telling me
it's not enough?

925
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,600
- What do you want me to do?
- I'm sorry.

926
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,560
On top of that, I don't do well
when I'm doing it remotely?

927
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,280
If I don't do well remotely
in this day and age,

928
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,880
I'll lose my job.

929
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,320
Uchimura.
