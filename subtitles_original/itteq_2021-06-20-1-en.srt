1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,360
The Quest.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,400
First in today's show is...

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,880
The Advisor Challenges
My Gold Medal.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,400
This is our usual project
to check the physical strength

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,920
of our 57-year-old advisor.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,200
The stage this time is Shikoku.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,800
He will try different activities
that require him to move his body.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,680
Mr Degawa,
we'll report something to you.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,400
What is it? You're scaring me.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,680
We'll add a new Degawa Girl
after Yumeppe.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,400
What? Another Degawa Girl will join?

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,240
- Yes. Yumeppe had an audition,
right?

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,520
- Yes.
- We chose one more girl there.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Wait. You shouldn't.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,680
If another new Degawa Girl joins,

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,200
the three old girls
will surely get angry again.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,680
Yumeppe joined. Surely, she brought
a breath of fresh air here.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,720
If I compare it to blood,
it used to be too thick.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,600
Who is the new Degawa Girl?

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,680
"This show was broadcasted
on the 20th of June, 2021"

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,440
Welcome to The Quest.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,720
Today, it's
My Gold Medal in Shikoku,

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,320
and Go to the End of the World.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,080
Wasshoi!

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
Hello, hello, hello.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,400
Hello!

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,720
Hello, everyone.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,000
First, it's Advisor's
My Gold Medal Tour.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,760
- Another new girl.
- Surprising.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,320
Actually, last year,
before the pandemic,

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,600
they were going to let
two new Degawa Girls join,

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,840
she already had an audition
at that time.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
- She was chosen.
- Already chosen.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,440
- She waited for a year.
- I see.

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,320
We're going to have more than
the original Bond Girls like this.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,880
There are going to be more and more,

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,520
and it will end up like AKB.

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,360
Like DGW48.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,320
In various places
like Malaysia and Thailand.

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,120
DGW48. I like it.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,680
Yeah?

42
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Isn't she pretty? We will go
no matter what the old girls say.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,160
We don't need any new girl.

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
You could've said that.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
It's a huge one.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
- You can do it, Miyazon.
- Yes.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,720
- Okay, let's beat it with this.
- Okay.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,680
Five hundred and fifty kilometres
away from Tokyo,

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,440
a new Degawa Girl joins.

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,320
My Gold Medal Tour in Shikoku.

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
We've come here!

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,640
- Kagawa!
- Oh? Three?

53
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,360
The opening starts with Degawa
and the three old girls.

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,240
The project this time
is My Gold Medal,

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
but there's an announcement!

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,800
What is it?

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,160
Madame isn't here,

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Yumeppe isn't here.

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,640
- Do you know what that means?
- What?

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,440
Something happened to Madame?

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,440
She didn't die!

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,680
I didn't say she died.

63
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,840
- Someone will drop out?
- I know!

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,160
Ms Kawakita is graduating!

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
You're horrible!

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,560
So mean! What's wrong with them?
Seriously!

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,960
Now, we'll announce the news
to the three girls.

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,360
Actually, this time,
a new Degawa Girl has come.

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,680
- What?
- Again?

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,120
- Wait a minute.
- Yes?

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,360
Mr Degawa said nothing about that?

72
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
- Me?
- Yes.

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,760
We don't want any new girl,
we already have the girls here.

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
You could've said that.

75
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,400
Exactly!

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
There's no way I didn't say that.

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,880
But you're grinning now.

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,040
They told me a new Degawa Girl
will come to film with us.

79
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,960
I went, "What? Again?

80
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,840
Show me a photo, then."

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,240
The moment Mr Takei
showed me his phone,

82
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
I threw it away.

83
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,040
That has to be a lie.

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
You said it.

85
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,000
I went, "We don't need this
new girl!" and threw it away.

86
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,320
I'll check when it's on air!

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Show me the data.

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
- There you go.
- Here's the photo.

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,280
The truth.

90
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
Let's go.

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,880
Isn't the girl lovely?

92
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,160
We'll go no matter what
the old girls say.

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,800
The new Degawa Girl, come here!

94
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
She's shining.

95
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,800
- She's cute.
- She's cute.

96
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,160
She's really fresh.

97
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,680
Hello, nice to meet you.

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
I am Mayuu Yokota.

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,600
Mayuu Yokota, 21 years old.

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
A winner of Miss Seventeen,

101
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,840
the young actress has appeared
in various dramas too.

102
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,480
Mayuu, tell them
what you're doing now.

103
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,320
I now work with Non-no magazine,

104
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,680
I made my first appearance
in autumn, 2020,

105
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,200
and was on the cover
for the first time.

106
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Impressive!

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
It's the cover that Ms Kawakita
has never been on.

108
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Don't say that.

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,880
Me too. Me too.

110
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,520
First appearance, first cover.

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
What? Is that so, Akane?

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
What about Maria?

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,600
- I had been a cover girl.
- Amazing!

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,320
Is it like, if a model is on a
cover, then she is fully qualified?

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
Yes, maybe.

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,040
We call it cover girl.

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,680
- What are you, Maria?
- Vivi's cover girl.

118
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,960
- And you, Akane?
- I was a cover girl.

119
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,640
- And you, Mayuu?
- I was also a cover girl.

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,520
- And you, Princess?
- Don't you dare ask me. Really.

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,200
Now, it is the regular
Degawa Girl Interview.

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,840
We'll start the interview
with the new Degawa Girl.

123
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,240
I am Mayuu Yokota, 21 years old.

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,640
I'm from Tokyo.

125
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,960
- Did you go to university?
- I didn't.

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,280
Good!

127
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,760
Yes!

128
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm not beaten yet.

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,200
I call Mayuko "Mayuko,"

130
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,400
but she will be Mayuu,
and they sound similar.

131
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,280
Then we can have Mayuu and Mayu B.

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
That's not right. Why?

133
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,360
Why would you change mine?

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,640
Mayuu, what do people call you?

135
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,480
I have no specific nickname.

136
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,440
- You're Yokota, right?
- Yes.

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,080
- Yokota.
- You'll call her Yokota?

138
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,040
So mean! That girl is the scariest.

139
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,640
You don't want to be called Yokota,
right?

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,600
It's totally okay.

141
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,960
I'm sure everyone will call her
Yokota very soon.

142
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,200
When you're asked whose idea it was,
say it was Maria's.

143
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Okay.

144
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,040
You hosted Hirunandesu, right?

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
What? You hosted Hirunandesu?

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,080
I did.

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,800
So you're in Nanchan's faction?

148
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,360
This show is Ucchan's.

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Which faction are you in?
Ucchan's or Nanchan's?

150
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,080
- She can't say.
- The most difficult question.

151
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm in the Weekend Ucchan faction.

152
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm impressed.

153
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm in Nanchan's faction
on weekdays, obviously,

154
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,840
and absolutely Ucchan's on weekends.

155
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
- Me too.
- Okay.

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
She's good at this, right?

157
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,440
Learn things like this gradually.

158
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
I will.

159
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,120
As a Girl, what is the thing
nobody can beat you at?

160
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,680
How do you advertise yourself?

161
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,680
I play guitar as a hobby,

162
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,160
- and I brought my guitar here.
- What?

163
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm nervous.

164
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,400
Do your best.

165
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,480
The sound of "I love you"

166
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Good.

167
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,720
Makes me feel I can become stronger

168
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
If this hadn't been
her first appearance,

169
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,520
the quality would have made us
edit the whole thing out.

170
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,080
Don't say that.

171
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Their faces.

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,960
Nice.

173
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,560
That was cute.

174
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Anyway, it's connected,
so put the guitar away.

175
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Okay.

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,240
And pretend it didn't happen?

177
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Look forward to when it's on air.

178
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,400
Finally, the main part,
My Gold Medal.

179
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,960
We'll first warm up by doing
the latest activity.

180
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
We've come to Tadotsu Marina.

181
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Customers can experience
various latest activities here,

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,600
but this is what
they'll do this time.

183
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,720
A huge red swim ring
is tied to a water scooter.

184
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
It's spinning.

185
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,080
It started spinning.

186
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,440
The is the latest activity,
Hurricane Boat.

187
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,800
If he can stay there
and not fall for one minute,

188
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,040
he gets a gold medal.

189
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Yokota, are you scared of this?

190
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
I love it.

191
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
She likes it.

192
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
But if only one person sits
on the Hurricane Boat,

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,480
it's not balanced
and it doesn't spin.

194
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,720
So they'll compete in teams of two,

195
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,680
and the winner will aim
for a gold medal with Degawa.

196
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
First, it's Hotta versus Tani.

197
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Let's have fun!

198
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,400
No, I'm really sick of it.

199
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,840
The water scooter starts.

200
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,080
Oh, I hate it!

201
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,400
It's scary already!

202
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,920
Spinning starts.

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
Can they hold on to it
for one minute?

204
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,960
Oh, they're doing their best.
Impressive.

205
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
But...

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,440
Hotta falls.

207
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,200
"Hotta out!"

208
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,360
Wait! It's cold! I fell! It's cold!

209
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,120
Someone, help me!

210
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,320
I actually wanted to enjoy it
for a longer time.

211
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
It's very fast!

212
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,040
All the flesh of my face
somehow went here.

213
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,560
- Does it really go so fast?
- Really!

214
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,600
She exaggerated it.

215
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,320
Again. She's doing it again.

216
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,200
- Akane, are you lying?
- I didn't!

217
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,160
Next, it's Kawakita versus Yokota.

218
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
What's this? It's scary!

219
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,520
Spinning starts.

220
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
This is fast!

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
- Impressive!
- It's fast.

222
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,840
It's fast! It's fast!

223
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,120
The disc accelerates.

224
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,200
And finally...

225
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,560
She's floating?

226
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
Kawakita falls.

227
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
It's freezing!

228
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,560
So Tani and Yokota will aim
for the gold medal with Degawa.

229
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Gold! Gold! Gold!

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
Gold! Gold! Gold!

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
Gold! Gold! Gold!

232
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
It's coming.

233
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
Now, let's go.

234
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,880
Gold Medal Challenge.

235
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,040
Spinning starts!

236
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,040
It's floating!

237
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,440
Isn't it the fastest so far?

238
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,640
Have a look at this fresh reaction.

239
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
And the old girl's reaction.

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,680
How many more seconds?

241
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,120
And no reaction.

242
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,680
Ten seconds left.

243
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,920
Hang in there!

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
They can do it.

245
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,320
It's faster.

246
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
This is bad.

247
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,160
One minute is over.

248
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,760
He successfully won a gold medal.

249
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Hurray!

250
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
We did it!

251
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,440
The start is very favourable.

252
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,640
- See you.
- See you.

253
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
What? What do you mean?

254
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,760
We'll leave here...

255
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,840
Wow, again!

256
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
Excuse me.

257
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,400
We'll have udon and go home.

258
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
Nice!

259
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,760
- Do your best, Yokota!
- I will.

260
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
Bye.

261
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,320
Isn't that impressive, Yokota?

262
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
Just 10 minutes ago,
they said they'd get a gold medal.

263
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
They don't look back at all.

264
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,560
The old girls somehow livened up
the atmosphere for the new girl.

265
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,960
My Gold Medal Tour.
The next destination is Tokushima.

266
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,400
Here we are,

267
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,640
Tokushima!

268
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,760
How do you feel
after trying to be a Degawa Girl?

269
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,040
I feel helpless.

270
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Well, this is the usual system
when we do it,

271
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,400
so you can't afford to say
you feel helpless.

272
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,560
I won't say it again.

273
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,920
That's quick.

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,040
That's quick.

275
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,480
Did you brush me off?

276
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,400
You met the three old Degawa Girls,
didn't you?

277
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,000
What do you think about them?

278
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,720
They make much more noise
in real life.

279
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
Good. Good, Yokota.

280
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,320
You've only watched them
on the television, right?

281
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,040
What's your impression of them
behind the scenes?

282
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,840
I thought Ms Kawakita pays a lot
of attention to her surroundings.

283
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,200
She's totally different
behind the scenes.

284
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
She's totally different?

285
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,160
She went, "Mr Degawa,
should I grill some meat?"

286
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,800
I was supposed to do the job.

287
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,360
What about Akane?

288
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,400
She's good at keeping
the distance she wants.

289
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,360
Wow, she's analysing!

290
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,320
She isn't good at keeping
the distance,

291
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,720
she's just not interested in
people.

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
What about Maria?

293
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,280
She was just like
what I saw on the television.

294
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
What was your impression of her?

295
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
She's free-spirited,

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,120
even when she left, she went,

297
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,400
"Yokota, film a video with me.
I named you, so let's film a video!"

298
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
She's laughing.

299
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,240
She didn't exactly name me.

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,480
What's your impression of me, then?

301
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,280
Did it change after seeing me behind
the scenes? Like another side?

302
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,880
It didn't change.
Like you can't talk smoothly.

303
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,440
The next challenge
of My Gold Medal...

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
is diving.

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
You'll go free diving,

306
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,800
and catch abalone.

307
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,760
- You get a gold medal if you can.
- Again.

308
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,400
The sea area to the south
of Anan City in Tokushima Prefecture

309
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,800
is well-known as
a treasure trove of abalone.

310
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,640
We have the assistance
of a local fisherman, Mr Ikeuchi.

311
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,560
By the way, how deep
is the water under this?

312
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,480
About four metres.

313
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,120
Wait.

314
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,760
According to the captain,

315
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,840
amateurs can dive three metres down.

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,400
If you catch an abalone
at three metres, it's a gold medal.

317
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,160
Three metres is rather deep.

318
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,760
As usual, Yokota will check it out.

319
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
It's freezing!

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
It's cold!

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,000
- It's cold?
- I'm scared!

322
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,080
The sea is scary!

323
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,920
You didn't release the air.

324
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,080
Now? Now?

325
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,760
Let some water in.

326
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,120
The cold will kill me.

327
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll go.

328
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,600
How is it?

329
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
Oh, she's gone.

330
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
Yokota dives swiftly.

331
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
She went nearly as far
as the bottom of the sea.

332
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,120
Impressive!

333
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
- Did you see beneath?
- I saw it!

334
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,520
Did you go to the rock?

335
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,440
Yes.

336
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,000
Captain, does it mean
she went three metres?

337
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,960
- Yes.
- Impressive!

338
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,320
Degawa finally goes in.

339
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,960
- Let's do three rounds.
- Okay.

340
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,440
I have three chances. Okay.

341
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,440
The first time of doing
the challenge.

342
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Do your best.

343
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,520
He splashed a lot of water, but...

344
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,360
Please do catch some abalone.

345
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,160
He floats up right away.

346
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,240
He is chubby,
so the buoyancy is high.

347
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,640
Captain, how many more metres?

348
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,960
Two more metres.

349
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,800
Two more metres? That means
I only dived one metre?

350
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes.

351
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,040
So he wears the weight for diving.

352
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,880
Teacher, the weight--

353
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,320
not teacher, Village Chief.

354
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,480
Captain!

355
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,200
Not teacher, Village Chief.

356
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
Captain!

357
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,280
He puts 10 kilograms
on Degawa's body.

358
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,120
Wait, Captain.

359
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,400
Can I really come back up?

360
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,440
- You can come back up.
- Really?

361
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,240
- I need to keep treading water.
- That's right.

362
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
That's about right.

363
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Tread water.

364
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm treading water hard now.
Let's stop that.

365
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,360
What treading water?

366
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,760
But if you don't do that,
you can't really sink.

367
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,960
I can't sink?

368
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,200
Now, the second time of
doing the challenge.

369
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Wow, he's going straight down!

370
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
Amazing!

371
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,480
He's going there.

372
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,280
Amazing!

373
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,640
But he can't hold his breath
and floats up quickly.

374
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,080
I saw it!

375
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
You saw it?

376
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,280
Darn it! Almost! I almost got it!

377
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,920
Nobody cares,
but he looks like Oba-Q.

378
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,960
What is it? The pink one?

379
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
Teacher, help me.

380
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,720
The next one is his last chance.
What will Degawa do?

381
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,440
I'll tie 10 kilograms here,

382
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,280
and two kilograms on my head.

383
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
He can't tie weight on his head,

384
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,040
but he'll do the last chance
with 12 extra kilograms.

385
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,600
I really might not
be able to come back.

386
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
- That's how determined I am.
- Yes.

387
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,920
- Watch carefully!
- Okay.

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,160
As a Degawa Girl--

389
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh, this is really heavy!

390
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,440
The problem is, until he peels off
the abalone and brings it back,

391
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,600
will his breath last?

392
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,040
Make it this time!

393
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,040
You can do it!

394
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,000
It really looks like he is going
towards the spot.

395
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,200
After all, the captain pushed him
from above.

396
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,040
He has his hands on the rock
with abalone.

397
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,160
He only has to pull it out
and rise up.

398
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
But...

399
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,480
He ran out of oxygen
right before he got it.

400
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
When we checked,

401
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,960
we see the abalone he finally took
slip out of his hand.

402
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,640
I let go of it!

403
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,840
He did not get a gold medal.

404
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,640
Really, the moment I thought
I got it,

405
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,160
it slipped out of my hand.

406
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
You were careless
at the last minute.

407
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,280
I'm so frustrated.

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,840
They go to have lunch.

409
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,760
Shikoku is famous
for its Sanuki Udon.

410
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,400
Here at Menya Shichifuku Bettei,

411
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,360
you can have some unique udon.

412
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,520
It's here.

413
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
So long.

414
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,040
It's so long.

415
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,480
It's Ippon Udon
which is 1.6 metres long.

416
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,600
It is thick and long,

417
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
so it is a lucky item
for praying for longevity.

418
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,320
What will I do?

419
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,320
You get a gold medal if you can
slurp one noodle.

420
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
Oh, a gold medal if I can eat this
without cutting it?

421
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,160
The director, Takei, shows him.

422
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,080
He's doing it.

423
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,320
As you can see,
he keeps slurping the noodle,

424
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,800
and puts all of it in his mouth
without cutting it.

425
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Try and do this.

426
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,280
But it's just slurping it.

427
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,440
No, it's not.

428
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,640
People who know it, know.
Those who don't, don't.

429
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,960
It's well-known that my throat
is like a baby's.

430
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,440
- Yokota tries it first.
- Ready, start!

431
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
You can do it.

432
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,720
Oh, she's slurping.

433
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
She's slurping it.

434
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,920
But Yokota can't slurp it at all.

435
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,280
- You can do it. Oh, no.
- You can do it.

436
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,000
Three, two, one.

437
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
It's over.

438
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,800
She failed.

439
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,920
Why?

440
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,560
Did you eat or keep it inside?

441
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
It was in my mouth.

442
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,080
You didn't swallow?

443
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,880
When I try to chew, it comes out.

444
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
That's why you slowed down?

445
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,040
Yes, there was no more room
for more noodle.

446
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,440
No more room.

447
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,320
You suddenly talk like Tokyo people.

448
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,320
Finally, it's Degawa's turn.

449
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,480
Ready...

450
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
Start.

451
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,360
Is this okay?

452
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,720
Degawa is only moving his mouth,

453
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,840
but he can't slurp the noodle.

454
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,760
He isn't slurping.

455
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
You can't slurp noodles?

456
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,680
I don't slurp when I eat ramen.

457
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,240
Like...

458
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,600
The udon noodle got stuck.

459
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,200
- You eat bite by bite?
- Yes, bite by bite.

460
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
Bite by bite...

461
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,920
Can I try slurping now?

462
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,680
Can he do it?

463
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,720
Why is that?

464
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,720
The sound is loud,

465
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,080
but the noodle goes up
and down into the soup.

466
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,000
It's enough.

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,240
I can't slurp.

468
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,200
The last challenge
of My Gold Medal...

469
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,320
takes place at Yoshino River that
runs across Tokushima and Kochi.

470
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,680
What you'll do is to float here
from the upper stream.

471
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,360
What is floating there?

472
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,680
Impressive!

473
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
Hydrospeed.

474
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,080
It's a river sport
that originated in France.

475
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,440
They'll wear fins

476
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,640
and go down a rapid stream
on a single-seater rubber boat.

477
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,800
It's close to the water surface
and the activity is powerful.

478
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,360
If the boat doesn't turn over

479
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,200
when he goes down the rapid stream,
he gets a gold medal.

480
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,640
I see.

481
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,120
We have the assistance

482
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,160
of Mr Higakure and Mr Yagisawa.

483
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,800
They are both tough men
who were winners

484
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,440
in international
rafting competitions.

485
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,400
Wow, impressive!

486
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,880
The two gentlemen...

487
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,080
Is that a facility?

488
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,280
What do you call that?

489
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,800
Shoppy shop?

490
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
Shoppy shop?

491
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,360
Are you both from the shop?

492
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm the owner.

493
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,760
He's an active athlete.

494
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,840
Oh, you're still active?

495
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,360
Is the river here relatively rapid?

496
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,320
It is said to be the most rapid
in Japan.

497
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
What?

498
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,400
Oh, no.

499
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
My palms got very sweaty.

500
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,720
It must be rather bad
if it's Japan's most rapid.

501
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,360
They're taught how to ride the boat
at once.

502
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,280
Push the front part
when the wave comes.

503
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,160
- When it comes.
- You push it?

504
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,160
Push. But if you don't look
at the wave until the end,

505
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,560
you'll be blown away easily.

506
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay, let's go, Yokota!
Let's get a gold medal!

507
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,760
Yes!

508
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,880
Yokota starts first.

509
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,600
Okay, let's go!

510
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,240
The teacher leads, just in case.

511
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,760
It's scary.

512
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,040
Can she do it?

513
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,480
She looks very happy.

514
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,920
Then...

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,320
it knocks over.

516
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,880
Oh, no.

517
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,480
But she managed to hold on
to the boat

518
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,960
and survived.

519
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,240
Yokota is recovered.

520
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,840
I thought I'd die!

521
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
Really.

522
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,400
Was it tough?

523
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,080
I don't know what I did!

524
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,240
I have no idea at all.

525
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,360
Is it difficult?

526
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,240
If Yokota's boat was knocked over,
isn't it difficult?

527
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
Now, Degawa goes!

528
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,480
Do your best!

529
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,880
It has started.

530
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,960
Entering the zone.

531
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,480
Degawa is tossed about by the waves,

532
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
but he manages to hang in there.

533
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,080
But...

534
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh, it flipped over!

535
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,680
You can do it, Mr Degawa!

536
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
It knocks over.

537
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,800
Mr Degawa, hang in there!

538
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,600
He failed.

539
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
Did you swallow water?

540
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
I swallowed a lot.

541
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,880
- You swallowed a lot, right?
- Yes.

542
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,720
I swallowed about a whole bottle.

543
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Me too.

544
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,280
Really, it felt like I was put
in a washing machine.

545
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,960
It felt like I was spun
in the washing machine's drum.

546
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,760
The only thing that's clear

547
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,920
is I swallowed one litre of water.

548
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,200
But Degawa will try once more
as he wished.

549
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,400
He'll do it at the difficult part,
here at the downstream just now.

550
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,720
Okay, let's go!

551
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
- I won't let go!
- You can do it.

552
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll get a gold medal!

553
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
The teacher goes in front,

554
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,600
and behind him is the show's
producer with a camera.

555
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,320
Can he do it without
the boat knocking over?

556
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,040
"Degawa"

557
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,080
You can do it.

558
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
Degawa charges in.

559
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,920
Can he overcome the rough waves?

560
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,720
It knocked over? No, it's okay!

561
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,440
He was hit many times
by the strong waves,

562
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,680
but he managed to hold out.

563
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,720
Impressive.

564
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,040
The goal is near.

565
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,960
Hang in there!

566
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,960
At that time...

567
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Oh, no.

568
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,000
The roughest wave, Producer Attack.

569
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,800
An accident!

570
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,240
But he didn't lose balance
and reached the goal successfully!

571
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,520
Amazing, Mr Degawa!

572
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,960
Even though he was obstructed
by one of the crew in an accident,

573
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Degawa won a gold medal.

574
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
Are you okay, Mr Degawa?

575
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,600
That was 1.5 litres.

576
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,920
- Well done, Mr Degawa.
- Thank you.

577
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,960
I swore I wouldn't let go of it.
That's all I thought when I did it.

578
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,320
So it's very difficult

579
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,960
to tell you what I did to win
the gold medal specifically.

580
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,480
I only endured it.

581
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,040
The teacher also said it was
the most rapid stream in Japan.

582
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,800
When the first rapid current ended,
the next one came immediately.

583
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,160
I couldn't let my guard down.

584
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,720
Then, Degawa can't recall
an important word.

585
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,560
I'm really sorry.

586
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,120
It's okay. What's the matter?

587
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm really sorry.

588
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,320
- Yokota?
- Yokota, Yokota.

589
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,960
Yokota...

590
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,960
So, it's Yokota from Tokyo
and Yumeppe from Fukushima.

591
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,120
Please take good care
of our new Degawa Girls.

592
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,960
This is the new Degawa Girl,
Mayuu Yokota.

593
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,880
Nice to meet you.

594
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,040
"Mayuu Yokota"

595
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
What do you think after filming?

596
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,600
It's always been my dream

597
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,360
to appear in The Quest,
so I'm happy my dream came true.

598
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,480
Yokota, you watched the episodes
Yumeppe were in, right?

599
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Yes.

600
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
Was there any pressure?

601
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
She made an impact by
speaking in Fukushima dialect,

602
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,320
so I was at a loss what to do
because I have no special skill.

603
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,880
- You can play the guitar.
- The guitar.

604
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,760
That was brilliant.

605
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,080
That was mean!

606
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,560
I did more things like dancing.

607
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,000
You did many things?

608
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Right? To be honest, the three
old girls also did other things,

609
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,080
like physical fitness test
that whole day,

610
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,400
but at that point,

611
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,680
we were told
several takes wouldn't be used.

612
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,920
And as we thought, that happened.

613
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,240
Even the three old girls said

614
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,120
they'd be edited out because of me.

615
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,120
It's your fault?

616
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,680
Because I performed badly.

617
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,240
No, that's Takei's fault.

618
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,240
It's none of Yokota's business.

619
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,600
Yokota just went all out to do it.

620
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
They should've edited Takei out.

621
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
You're so cool!

622
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,800
Okay, this is the next part.

623
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,520
Go to the End of the World!

624
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,480
It's Miyazon.

625
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,880
Yes, this time,

626
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,280
I'll try to catch marlin again.

627
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
It's when you got lots of help.

628
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
It was a pity the last time,
that even with everyone's help,

629
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
you couldn't catch any.

630
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,440
But at that location,
there was something I could catch.

631
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,480
What's that?

632
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,080
I became the sightseeing ambassador
of Yonaguni!

633
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,520
Because of that?

634
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
Because of that.

635
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,800
- The term of office is three years.
- It's long.

636
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,560
Yes. This time, as part of my job,

637
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,840
I will try to catch a marlin
that's over 100 kilograms again,

638
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,800
and as the sightseeing ambassador,

639
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,960
I will introduce the attractions
of Yonaguni.

640
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,880
I'm impressed.

641
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,600
You don't have to be from there
to be a sightseeing ambassador.

642
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,560
I don't know the requirements
of sightseeing ambassadors.

643
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,200
Okay, let's go.
Go to the End of the World...

644
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,120
The Quest!

645
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,200
The mission doesn't finish
until he achieves the goal.

646
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Go to the End of the World.

647
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,520
Yonaguni is 1,900 kilometres
away from Tokyo,

648
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,880
the island is on the westernmost end
of Japan, near the country border.

649
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,200
Last time, we came to Yonaguni
to catch marlin, right?

650
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
I really fell in love
with this island,

651
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,920
and our guide was Yassan, right?

652
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,200
Yassan is the famous guide
in Yonaguni who helped us last time.

653
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,760
He told me to be the sightseeing
ambassador if I love it so much.

654
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,960
I told him I couldn't do it,

655
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,400
but he called me when I was in Tokyo
and said I could.

656
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,080
A week after the call ended,

657
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,400
he said, "You got the job."

658
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,440
I actually became the sightseeing
ambassador like this.

659
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Do you do any activity in specific?

660
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm going to.

661
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,960
The amount of marlin caught
in Yonaguni is the largest in Japan.

662
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,520
He can't call himself a sightseeing
ambassador without catching one.

663
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,480
He joins the fishermen at once.

664
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,280
This isn't our first time meeting.

665
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,440
Captain Ichinari and Captain Tanaka
also helped us last time.

666
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,080
Last July, they spent eight days
and over 60 hours fishing,

667
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,840
but they couldn't see a marlin,
let alone catch one.

668
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
It figured it out?

669
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,040
- It did.
- What?

670
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,440
Darn it!

671
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,200
As a result...

672
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,280
Recently, people say you can't catch
fish on Mr Tsugu's boat.

673
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,240
I just happened not to be able
to catch any, right?

674
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,200
That's right.

675
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,400
How about this time?

676
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,680
I brought two people who went
marlin-fishing for the first time,

677
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,040
they caught a 150-kilogram one
and a 130-kilogram one.

678
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,360
- They fished for the first time?
- Yes.

679
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,880
They came after watching The Quest.

680
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,400
I couldn't catch any at all
and they still came. How optimistic.

681
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,160
They set sail
and aim to catch a marlin.

682
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,000
Catching a fish that's over
100 kg is the mission this time.

683
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
We'll do our best.

684
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,360
He's our sightseeing ambassador,

685
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,240
and he's working so hard
for our island.

686
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
The fishing ground of marlin
is 20 kilometres

687
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,520
to the south of the island.

688
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,520
I'll get the lure out and pull.

689
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,120
Marlin-fishing is done by trolling.

690
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
A rod is set up at the stern,

691
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,200
a bait fish or lure is drawn through
the water to lure marlins.

692
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,240
Then, suddenly...

693
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,720
It bit!

694
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
- It bit! Did it bite?
- It obviously shook.

695
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,600
It bit.

696
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,880
Wow, this is rather...

697
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,120
The line is pulled
at a very high speed.

698
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,000
Please stand by.

699
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,480
It's a revenge match.

700
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,160
A big chance suddenly came.

701
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,760
At that time...

702
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,200
It broke?

703
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,560
Watch out.

704
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,920
- It broke.
- It broke?

705
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,880
It broke.

706
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,800
The fish broke it?

707
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,000
The line broke unexpectedly.

708
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,800
It was broken.

709
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
It suddenly broke.

710
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,600
How big was that?

711
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,720
What size of fish can the string
pull up?

712
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,480
It can easily catch
a 150-kilogram one.

713
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,520
That means the one just now
weighed 200 kilograms?

714
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,760
There's a chance.

715
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
There's an enormous one.

716
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
Okay! Come, marlin!

717
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,160
Now, he suddenly got excited.

718
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,600
He's motivated.

719
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,800
Okay!

720
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,440
That's unique.

721
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,200
But he was excited
only at the start.

722
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,560
In the end, nothing bit
in the six hours that followed.

723
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,480
Let's go tomorrow.

724
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,800
Yes, let's do our best.

725
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,960
This is amazing.

726
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Now, Sightseeing Ambassador Miyazon

727
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,560
will introduce the attractions
of Yonaguni.

728
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,760
First, it's the largest moth
in Japan, Atlas moths.

729
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,040
He has come to Ayamihabiru Museum
in the eastern part of the island.

730
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,040
It's a protected species,
so you don't see it often,

731
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,160
but they emerged today,
so I'd like to have a look.

732
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,240
His guide is the specialist,
Ms Sugimoto.

733
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,600
The Atlas moths emerged,

734
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,080
is it like having a festival here?

735
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,640
I assumed it would be
in a huge insect cage,

736
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,920
but they're just here.

737
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
They have an interesting habit
of staying still,

738
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,320
it's the only rare characteristic.

739
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,920
The wings that mimic the head
of a snake are unique.

740
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,240
They are really this big.

741
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,160
- Viewers can't feel it.
- No.

742
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,800
My hand is huge.

743
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
I have my phone.

744
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,080
This is huge too.

745
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,800
Also, cuisine in Yonaguni
as recommended

746
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,280
by the sightseeing ambassador.

747
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,240
He came to a diner run by a family
of fishermen on the island,

748
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,840
Uminchu Shokudo.

749
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,240
Its selling point is dishes made

750
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,480
with fresh fish caught
by the fishermen in the morning.

751
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,600
This is a restaurant
Miyazon regularly visits.

752
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,920
Will you make my usual dish for me?

753
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,480
Every time I come here.

754
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,280
I can eat as many as three plates.

755
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,560
What is the dish in Yonaguni their
sightseeing ambassador recommends?

756
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,160
This is it!

757
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,960
Wow! Thank you, as always.
It's here.

758
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,480
Spaghetti Aglio e Olio!

759
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,200
This is the Number 1 dish
in Yonaguni.

760
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
I love the thin noodles,

761
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
and no extra ingredient is added.
Simple is best.

762
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,960
It's absolutely delicious.

763
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
It looks delicious, but...

764
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,760
I've come to Yonaguni.

765
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,600
- Is this ordered most often?
- It is.

766
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,920
- More than marlin?
- Yes.

767
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Mr Tsugu,
this is really delicious, right?

768
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
It is, I put it on rice
when I eat it.

769
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
Someone loves it more than me.

770
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,080
Day two.

771
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,920
Again!

772
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,760
Another letter from the children.

773
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,960
He received an encouraging message
from the local primary school kids.

774
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
From Daichi Kawata.

775
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,080
"Mr Miyazon, please do your best
to catch a 100-kilogram marlin."

776
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600
"We'll all root for you,

777
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
you can do it if you try!"

778
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,680
Mr Timon D?

779
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,440
"You can do it if you try!"

780
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,800
He sets off with
the children's encouragement.

781
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
They said the same thing.

782
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,880
Look over there,
maybe the waves today are high.

783
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,400
The water is splashing
quite high upon the rock.

784
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,080
But it's said it's easier to catch
marlin if the sea is a bit rough.

785
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
Good.

786
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,840
I'm confident we'll catch one.

787
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
They don't want to miss this chance,

788
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,920
so fishermen go towards the offing
ahead of us.

789
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,000
How many boats went there?

790
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,480
About 15 boats.

791
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,680
Which boat will they come to?

792
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,440
But unlike his expectations,

793
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,320
not even the bonito and yellowfin
tuna used as bait are seen,

794
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,760
let alone a marlin.

795
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,200
- What about the boats around?
- Nobody got in touch.

796
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,960
I think nobody caught any.

797
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,480
Isn't it wrong
if no boat caught any?

798
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,400
So many sailed today.

799
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,320
Why is no fish showing up?

800
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,360
Dolphins.

801
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,720
They're cute if you see them
at aquariums.

802
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,080
They eat the bait
right after we put it there.

803
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Dolphins chase after fishing boats

804
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,320
and skillfully eat the bait
hanging from the rod.

805
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,480
That's why there is no marlin.

806
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,560
We can only go to a place
with no dolphins.

807
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,040
But after that,
something unexpected happened.

808
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,840
We caught a marlin after that.

809
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,000
But it was only the second day
of filming,

810
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,040
we wanted to do something about it,
so that it wouldn't end in two days.

811
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,800
As the sightseeing ambassador,
I thought we shouldn't end it here.

812
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,280
So we'll play the video in which
we catch the fish at the end.

813
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't have to say it,
but in that case,

814
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,840
all the people on the island
knew we caught the fish on day two,

815
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
so when they watch this,

816
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,160
they'd think the day isn't right.

817
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,920
Opinions will be divided.

818
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,880
I should say it at a time like this,
so that I won't feel guilty.

819
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,040
This is my way of life.

820
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,360
So I'd like to show you the lovely
things on the island.

821
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,320
Thanks.

822
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,240
So we'll show you sightseeing
information Miyazon recommends.

823
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,800
First, sea water of Yonaguni

824
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,400
is cooked in a kettle
to make Yonaguni Sea Salt.

825
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,640
Three-star Michelin restaurants.

826
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,040
The chefs there use the salt here.

827
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,080
- How long has it been boiling?
- It's the 10th day.

828
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,320
- You boil it for 10 days.
- That's right.

829
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
We boil it gently,

830
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,320
so it has a bitter taste.

831
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,240
It brings out the flavour
of the ingredients.

832
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,720
It makes vegetables taste sweet,

833
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
and makes meat juicy.

834
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,800
And the sea salt made miraculously
in 2020 is...

835
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,880
the giant salt crystals here.

836
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,320
The particles are huge.

837
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,920
The crystals...

838
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,520
One crystal is... Look, this big.

839
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,560
How about the taste?

840
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,960
It's irresistible.

841
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,560
It has more flavour than saltiness.

842
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,440
My concept of salt crumbled.

843
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,400
Maybe we can't make this again.

844
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,680
It was produced as an accident
under various conditions,

845
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,600
the salt of miracle
is sold at 200,000 yen per kilogram.

846
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,960
On the other hand, the island's
main crop is sugar cane.

847
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,800
Sugar cane in Yonaguni
is processed to produce raw sugar.

848
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
Oh, it's here!

849
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,840
Rather than transparent,
it's more like green.

850
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,680
The juice is...

851
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,240
poured into a big pot.

852
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,520
Their sightseeing ambassador
tries raw sugar making.

853
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,760
It looks like this
when it is simmered down.

854
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
Okay!

855
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,080
Pour it into the mould! Go!

856
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,720
That big pot simmered down
to so little.

857
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,040
It's ready after it is cooled
overnight and solidifies.

858
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,640
Raw sugar!

859
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
What is it? Something like
a huge piece of caramel?

860
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,800
What does the handmade raw sugar
taste like?

861
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,320
It has a nice crunch.

862
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,520
My filling will be damaged
if I'm not careful.

863
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,040
Is this what raw sugar is like?

864
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,560
- Good? Hard?
- Hard.

865
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,000
It's similar to sweet.

866
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,800
The hardest among
the ones you've made so far?

867
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,400
I didn't fail, right?

868
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,840
But you can use it to cook, right?

869
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
None of them says clearly,

870
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,960
but it probably was a failure.

871
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,320
Also, a mystery in the sea.

872
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,760
In 1986, a huge undersea structure
was discovered

873
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,920
in the southern part of Yonaguni.

874
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,400
It was named the Yonaguni Monument,

875
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,560
but was it made by humans?

876
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,360
Or did it form naturally?

877
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,400
There are two theories.

878
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,600
I've come to the Submarine Ruins!

879
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,880
Also, a mystery in the sea.

880
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,400
A huge undersea structure
was discovered

881
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,400
in the southern part of Yonaguni.

882
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,880
It was named the Yonaguni Monument,

883
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,040
but was it made by humans?

884
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,840
Or did it form naturally?

885
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,800
There are two theories.

886
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,080
I've come to the Submarine Ruins!

887
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,520
It's like a castle.

888
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,840
This is the Yonaguni Monument.

889
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,520
What you can see now
is only a small part,

890
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,440
but in fact, this is the structure
shown here.

891
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,560
It is 250 metres long
from east to west,

892
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,280
and 150 metres long
from north to south.

893
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,280
Its height is 25 metres,

894
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,200
it's the size of one castle.

895
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,640
He goes to the most famous point
called the Main Terrace.

896
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,440
If this wasn't underwater,

897
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,560
it's just like a castle.

898
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,480
There are flat surfaces and vertical
walls that are 23 metres long.

899
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,240
There isn't even one stone
in the area, and it's unnatural.

900
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,160
The 90-degree straight angle here.

901
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,760
It makes you think
it was made by humans.

902
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,960
This part is the pillar,

903
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,080
those are holes where something
was inserted in the past.

904
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,920
It feels like
people used to live here.

905
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,440
If they are things made by people,

906
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
it means that 6,000 to
10,000 years ago,

907
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
a civilisation that built high-level
stone buildings existed.

908
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,160
The history of human civilisation
will be changed greatly.

909
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,200
Is it artificial?
Or did it form naturally?

910
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,160
I think your opinion
will be divided,

911
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,880
but isn't it more romantic
to not make it clear?

912
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,600
I went to a zoo with my friend.

913
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,520
I saw a lion and went,
"It's dangerous! I'm scared!"

914
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,560
"There's no way I can win
if it attacks."

915
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,600
My friend went,

916
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,840
"No, the most frightening one
is mankind."

917
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
We went to the polar bear zone,

918
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,920
there was a huge polar bear.

919
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
I went, "It must be strong!

920
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,800
If I fight it,
I'll stand no chance. It's scary!"

921
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,520
He went, "No, the most frightening
one is mankind."

922
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,240
People have to make
everything clear.

923
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,160
In the end, when we left,
I thought mankind was scary.

924
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,080
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
It's the main topic, marlin-fishing.

925
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,840
This is day two of filming.

926
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,080
Because they encountered dolphins,

927
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,520
it was hopeless to catch marlin
in that situation.

928
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,600
Is there a way to deal with it?

929
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,880
We have to go somewhere
without dolphins.

930
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,360
It bit!

931
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,600
It bit!

932
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,480
An unexpected hit
under this situation.

933
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,360
It bit!

934
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,840
You can do it!

935
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,560
Please.

936
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,160
Can I hook it?

937
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,600
They drive the boat fast
to surely hook the needle.

938
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,320
And then...

939
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,480
This isn't mahi-mahi!

940
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
I feel that this isn't a mahi-mahi!

941
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,040
- Totally different.
- The weight is totally different.

942
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,920
Oh, no. I can't reel it in at all.

943
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,840
Only Miyazon knew
when he confronted the fish,

944
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,400
something conveyed through the rod
made him feel it was a big fish.

945
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
Do it slowly, be patient.

946
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,480
I swear I'll catch it.

947
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,480
Good.

948
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,040
Thirty minutes after it bit,

949
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,400
there was finally a change
in the battle

950
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,040
between the boat and the sea.

951
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,840
It jumped.

952
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,280
It's a marlin.

953
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,880
The marlin is jumping!

954
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,240
The marlin finally showed up.

955
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,600
You can see it.

956
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,040
It's closer than 20 metres.

957
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,680
It struggles in every direction.

958
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,040
It isn't easy to deal with...

959
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,880
The line comes out again.

960
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,040
I pulled it up and it started moving
when it got closer.

961
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,880
I have to start reeling
from scratch again.

962
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,000
I swear I'll catch it.

963
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,920
Good.

964
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,040
The battle of advance and retreat
lasted for over an hour.

965
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,640
I have a stomach ache now.

966
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,120
It's number two.

967
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,200
I must catch it soon.

968
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,200
I either catch it
or embarrass myself.

969
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,800
It's over there.

970
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,000
It came out.

971
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,320
Marlin's attack.

972
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,560
It's scary.

973
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Scary!

974
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,200
You can do it!

975
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,960
Oh, no! The string
is very slack now!

976
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,680
Now, let's settle this!

977
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,720
Okay! Come!

978
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,840
He squeezed the last bit
of his strength.

979
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,000
The captain knows.

980
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
I see it.

981
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,200
I see it.

982
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,040
Finally, the marlin is at the stern.

983
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,320
For now, I've reeled it in.

984
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,720
And it puts a full stop
to the long battle.

985
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,240
All right!

986
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,600
- His fighting spirit.
- Great, Captain!

987
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,640
So cool!

988
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,440
Captain suddenly roared
this time again.

989
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,960
All right!

990
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,400
Miyazon is a bit creeped out
this time as well.

991
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,680
Mr Tsugu stabbed it with a harpoon
and you smiled.

992
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,680
I smiled.

993
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
It wasn't filmed.

994
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,560
Mr Tsugu shouted "Darn it!"
last time,

995
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,080
and the island's people
kept teasing him.

996
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,480
Darn it!

997
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,600
He said he got many calls
after that.

998
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,920
People told him it was funny,

999
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,840
so he said he wouldn't let us
see that this time.

1000
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,520
At that time, I thought,
"He messed up."

1001
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,040
All right!

1002
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,680
It was a battle.

1003
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
The deadly struggle
lasted for an hour and 20 minutes,

1004
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,960
and finally, they killed the marlin.

1005
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680
I finally caught a marlin!

1006
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh, thank you, Mr Tsugu!

1007
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,760
We did it!

1008
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,720
Mr Tsugu.

1009
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,760
It's a valuable one.

1010
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,480
It will stay in my memory
in my life ahead as a fisherman.

1011
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,800
Anyway, what a relief!

1012
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,360
Thank goodness we caught it.

1013
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,960
They transport the marlin
to the port to weigh it.

1014
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,000
Will it exceed their goal,
100 kilograms?

1015
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,000
Have a look at this. It's huge.

1016
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,280
How heavy is it now, really?

1017
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,800
What?

1018
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,400
97 kilograms.

1019
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,600
He couldn't achieve his goal.

1020
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,800
Mr Tsugu, please hold it
for a bit longer.

1021
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,840
It is over 100!

1022
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,360
No, hang on.

1023
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,960
This one is huge!

1024
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,560
97 kilograms.

1025
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,400
It's thin.

1026
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,280
We pulled so hard, but it's thin.

1027
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,720
Can we feed it water?

1028
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,160
Shall we put reinforcing bars in?

1029
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,520
Put reinforcing bars in?

1030
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,840
Let us have a meeting first.

1031
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,000
He suggested to put
reinforcing bars in.

1032
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,800
Okay, let's go again!

1033
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,520
After that,
he held out for three days,

1034
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,200
but he couldn't catch a fish
over 100 kg before it ended.

1035
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,480
Can I say something
that bothered me?

1036
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,360
Look carefully at the photo
I took with Mr Tsugu.

1037
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,640
Mr Tsugu weighs 115 kilograms.

1038
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,120
The marlin is bigger than him,
why is it 97 kilograms?

1039
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,960
The marlin is obviously bigger
than Mr Tsugu.

1040
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,440
Is this an optical illusion?

1041
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,600
Lastly, he goes to greet
the island's children

1042
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
who rooted for him.

1043
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,440
This day is the graduation ceremony
of the local Kubura Primary School.

1044
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,320
Congratulations on your graduation!

1045
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,080
Can I say something
as the sightseeing ambassador?

1046
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,120
Graduates, congratulations.

1047
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,680
Thank you!

1048
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,560
At Kubura Primary School here,

1049
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,920
you worked hard to study
and exercise,

1050
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,120
and you have graduated.

1051
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,520
You are the treasure
of Kubura Primary School.

1052
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,520
Please walk on your new path
with confidence.

1053
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,200
Separation certainly isn't sad.

1054
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,120
There is separation, that's why
there are new encounters.

1055
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,920
With gratitude for your parents,
teachers and friends,

1056
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,320
please start going
towards your new dream.

1057
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,280
Congratulations!

1058
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,960
Sightseeing Ambassador,
Anzenmanzai's Miyazon.

1059
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,160
Are they going to go
to separate schools?

1060
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,360
They'll go next door.

1061
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,040
What do you mean "go next door"?

1062
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,280
That's the middle school.

1063
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
After children graduate
from Kubura Primary School,

1064
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,200
they will all go to the adjacent
Kubura Middle School.

1065
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,760
Oh, thank goodness.

1066
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,040
Only a different building.

1067
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,200
Always cheerful and happy.

1068
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,480
Let's do it! Let's do it!
Let's do it!

1069
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,080
Thank you, everyone in Yonaguni.

1070
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,080
That's all for Miyazon's
marlin-fishing.
