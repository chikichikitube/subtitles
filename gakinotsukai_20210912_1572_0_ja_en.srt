1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This studio is cold.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm used to it, so I'm trying to wear long sleeves.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's trying to wear it.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This room was really cold.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was surprised.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good morning.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You look good.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I look good.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You look really good.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can tell from this past.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What day is it today?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's September 12th.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's the occasion?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's my son's birthday.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You know it, right?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
September 8th is Matsumoto's birthday.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today is the 12th.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a little past, but...

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The Tokyo Olympics...

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There are many competitions.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's really cool.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It would be great if it could be done.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He said to give it to me as a birthday present.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He has been racing in the past 8 races and has made his dream come true

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Starting with the world record of high speed racing

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He challenges the fastest in the world of racing, the 3 laps

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A miracle play in the air

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He hits back the 150km high speed ball

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A new world record in weightlifting

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A 50cm fire limbo dance

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He swam 25 meters in 10 seconds

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He also challenged the swimming skills of the team

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The 58 year old Matsumoto will challenge this time

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's see what he's got

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's see this

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Basketball

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's here

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is this?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Did you see that?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This! This! This!

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This!

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This!

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here! Here!

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This!

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is really cool!

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You wanted to do this?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I wanted to do a Hollywood dunk.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, no, no, no.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Dunk?

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But if you guys do it, you'll let me do it, right?

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have a lot of confidence.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do it quickly.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Quickly?

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's your birthday, but do it quickly.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Quickly?

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you can, then do it properly

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everyone, let's change into black clothes

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's change

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
For Matsumoto's dream, the Black Clothes Week has come after 2 years

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi decides on the ARIUFU

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The big guy is the most...

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
...thick.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But he's quite tall.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's quite tall.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's tall.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Good morning!

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good morning.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did you hear anything?

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I did.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's 58, but he's like a Japanese chord.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:02:56,440
He has a sense of

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Did you explain it properly?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, I did.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What kind of way did you say it?

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What kind of way?

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Somehow, that technique...

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sorry, I didn't see the part of the dance.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Somehow, I heard rumors that it was done quickly and it was over quickly.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And, to say the truth, Mr. Hosei said it.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I admitted it.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Then, let's do it.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't push me.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't push me.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Lift it up and go down.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Excuse me.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Legs.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't put any strength.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can't put any strength.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can't put any strength.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's easier to do if you put strength.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can't do it.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll do it.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll do it.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
OK.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ready, set, go!

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ouch!

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ouch!

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What is this?

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Put it down slowly.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Put it down slowly.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Put it down slowly.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is too heavy.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Bring a mat.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Bring a mat.

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll use the mat.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You can use that.

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can use this to get a hit.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can use this to get a hit.

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm not that happy.

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not that happy.

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When I'm waiting for you to get ready,

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you should stand up properly.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't have to say anything.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, then.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you jump and come to the right position,

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll do this.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll do this.

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please do it at the right timing.

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll do it.

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Excuse me.

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ready, set, go!

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Here we go.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's going well.

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Bounce here.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Put your feet on it.

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Put your feet on it.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Put your feet on it.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Put your feet on it.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't stand up.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can't stand up.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ready, set, go!

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is good, isn't it?

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Here, here.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's right, that's right!

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
More, more, more!

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
More, more, more!

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Keep going, keep going, keep going!

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Raise it, raise it, raise it!

148
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
1, 2, 3!

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Alright!

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay!

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Ouch!

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here!

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes!

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I heard something.

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Masumasa?

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I heard something.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
When I went to the other side, I heard a small voice.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
My armpit hurts.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're a fool.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Seriously.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Who was it?

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The one who was doing this.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Was it you?

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Are you angry?

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't think I'm angry.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I just said I wanted to sing.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It hurts a little.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If I'm not angry, I can't say, wow.

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I said, let's do it.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I said, I can't do it anymore.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I said, it's okay.

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you wrote it because you thought it was good.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Excuse me.

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Excuse me.

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Excuse me.

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You don't have to do it anymore?

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have a sideburn.

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have a sideburn.

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I have to have all the Japanese energy.

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know what?

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I know that they are not going to succeed.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, no, no.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I know that, you guys.

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's not going to happen.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They are not motivated from the beginning.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They are serious.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm telling you to lend me your strength!

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why are you crying?

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're the one who's telling me to do this.

191
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're the one who's telling me to lend me my strength.

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
On the contrary.

193
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I've lost all my strength.

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't want to be a glutton?

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's what I'm saying.

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can't do that yourself.

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you asking me if I have a military service when I'm over 8 years old?

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The second challenge, receiving a complaint from Matsumoto

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is this okay?

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think it's okay

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it's not as much of a burden as it was before

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But either way...

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ah, please.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ah, somehow...

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He's in a good mood.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Maybe I said too much.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sorry, I think I said too much.

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But I think that if you don't have one feeling, you won't succeed.

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We're definitely friends that can be understood.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Except for Inamoto.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Eh?

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He's not hooked on it.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's do it.

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Masumoto-san, please come here.

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Please.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's go.

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There is something to be attached.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Should I turn it over?

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes, please.

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Please turn it over.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Please attach it.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's go.

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go.

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going to fill the meat. I can do it.

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can do it.

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is bad.

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's hard.

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't shake it.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Did you do the simulation?

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's okay. I did it.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do it slowly.

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Do it like the simulation.

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If you can put it on, you can get the license.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What kind of simulation did you do?

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The age of simulation.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tell me the age of the person who did the simulation.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, let's start.

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't put the ball in.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The start is okay.

242
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The ball.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ready, go.

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's heavy.

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Goal!

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Turn the ball towards you.

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OK, OK, OK.

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why is your hand on Inoue's shoulder?

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You have to put it in with this.

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's important to catch the ball with your hand.

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ready, go!

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll do it.

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Ready, go!

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Goal!

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mr. Matsumoto!

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr. Matsumoto!

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That can't be on the screen.

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That was probably...

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When he jumped,

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
his face was already on the screen.

265
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Really?

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I can't reach them.

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't reach them.

268
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But he said,

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you very much.

270
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think he said,

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's OK.

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you don't want to quit, then quit.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's go home.

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We've done what we had to do.

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We can't do anything more than that.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The next day

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Excuse me.

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Excuse me.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Excuse me.

280
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Excuse me.

281
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Excuse me.

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I thought of giving up the trombone and lifting it up with the power of the balloon.

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If there was something unfortunate, I would have given up.

284
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But I think it can't be helped.

285
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,640
They were shouting, ''We're going to cut your flesh!''

286
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,280
It was really scary.

287
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,080
They were actually cutting my flesh.

288
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,720
When they were cutting my flesh,

289
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
I don't know who it was,

290
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,040
but there was a guy who was laughing like, ''Keta, Keta, Keta, Keta, Keta, Keta!''

291
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,800
It's not a place to laugh.

292
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,600
Everyone wants to believe,

293
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,760
but they're all idiots.

294
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
They can't get anything good out of this.

295
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,520
That's not good.

296
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
I'm saying this because I trust you!

297
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Except for Inamoto.

298
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Why?

299
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Right?

300
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
So, really,

301
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
I can't trust you?

302
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Then, I'll do my best.

303
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Please.

304
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
He regains his composure and takes on the third challenge.

305
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Alright, let's go!

306
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I think we can do the next one.

307
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Let's go.

308
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm always curious about this mat.

309
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
You can ride on the chair like the one before.

310
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
You can sleep facing the front.

311
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I think I'll do a simulation.

312
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Yes, you did.

313
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Please sleep facing the front.

314
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I'll set it up.

315
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Which way is my head facing?

316
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Head facing that way.

317
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
I'll do a simulation.

318
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
What are you eating?

319
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
You're so considerate.

320
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Please do it.

321
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,520
A smart kid did a simulation.

322
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I think this is okay.

323
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
This is okay.

324
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
You should go to a proper university.

325
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,520
This car is really scary.

326
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,520
This car is a simulation car.

327
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,520
What kind of simulation car is this?

328
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I don't know.

329
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Is it a young car?

330
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Yes.

331
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,520
It's too different from the young cars.

332
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,920
There are no simulators for 58 years old.

333
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,320
There are no simulators for 58 years old.

334
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,820
I want to get poisoned.

335
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,920
Please do it.

336
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,920
It's dangerous.

337
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Help me.

338
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Help me.

339
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Help me.

340
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
More.

341
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Lower your body.

342
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Let's put it down

343
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
If it's this far, it's fine

344
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Is it fine?

345
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Then please try lifting it

346
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm going to lift it

347
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
It's going to work

348
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
It's going

349
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
It's going

350
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
It's going

351
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
It's coming

352
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
It's coming

353
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
It's coming

354
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
It depends on how you pass

355
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
What should I do?

356
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
This much?

357
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
It's close

358
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Next!

359
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Let's go!

360
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Put your hands out!

361
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
If you hit here, it will turn

362
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Close!

363
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
You can do it!

364
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
The direction is...

365
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Close!

366
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Close!

367
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,920
It's OK now.

368
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
What should I do?

369
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
So close!

370
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Matsumoto-san, you can go in a little more.

371
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
I want to go in a little more.

372
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
It's good, isn't it?

373
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I'll go in a little more.

374
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Matsumoto-san?

375
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Matsumoto-san, you were so worried.

376
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
You can go in a little more.

377
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
He changed again.

378
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,920
If it was impossible, it would have been better to bend the handle.

379
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
I see.

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
You should have bent it.

381
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Yes, bent it and put it here.

382
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Let's go to say that.

383
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
I should have tied it up and done this.

384
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Yes.

385
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Let's go.

386
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Let's go to say that.

387
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Let's go.

388
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Excuse me.

389
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Hello.

390
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I felt like he was being bullied.

391
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
He was aiming for the face.

392
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,920
He was saying that he was sorry that he didn't hit the face.

393
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Masao-san, that's a misunderstanding. He was the one who hit the face.

394
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I think it's really important.

395
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I think it's really important.

396
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
It's really bad.

397
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Whether you have the will to do it or not, really.

398
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I can't understand what Mr. Matsumoto is saying.

399
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
I know.

400
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
I was so surprised.

401
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I can't see what he's saying.

402
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
His eyes are all red.

403
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
No, he's angry.

404
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Anyone would be angry if he did that.

405
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Think about it.

406
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Think about it.

407
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
It's better not to say it.

408
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Of course.

409
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
That's the way it is.

410
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes.

411
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Please.

412
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Say goodbye.

413
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Yes.

414
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Yes.

415
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Let's think about it.

416
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Yes.

417
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm sorry.

418
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm sorry.

419
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm sorry.

420
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm very sorry.

421
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,920
The fourth challenge based on the reflection of the previous one.

422
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
You can definitely do it.

423
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Yes, I can do it.

424
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
This is the main character.

425
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
This is.

426
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
It looks like it's in.

427
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Yes, it does.

428
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
But Fujiwara, please do this.

429
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
The idea is perfect.

430
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
If I do my best.

431
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
It doesn't hurt.

432
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
It's not dangerous.

433
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
It doesn't hurt.

434
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Thank you.

435
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
You want to show your youthful side?

436
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,920
If it's good, everything is good.

437
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Yes.

438
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Let's go.

439
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Why is it dangerous?

440
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Is there a mat in the bedroom?

441
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Well, let's get on it.

442
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Hold it.

443
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Oh, this is dangerous.

444
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Put it on.

445
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Fujiwara, get ready.

446
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Well...

447
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
First, put on the helmet.

448
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Put it on.

449
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Put on the helmet properly.

450
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Here we go.

451
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Good, good, good.

452
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Good, good.

453
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Then, pass it.

454
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Hey!

455
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Here it comes!

456
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
This is so cool.

457
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
So cool.

458
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
The ball... the ball...

459
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
The ball is out.

460
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
The ball is out.

461
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Again.

462
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Put the ball back.

463
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
There.

464
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Yes.

465
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Be careful.

466
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
It's amazing.

467
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Good, good, good!

468
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
It's coming, it's coming!

469
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
It's coming, it's coming!

470
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Slowly, slowly!

471
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
PON!

472
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
It's in!

473
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
It's in!

474
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
It's in!

475
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Congratulations!

476
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
It's so messy.

477
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
You went in so cleanly.

478
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
What's going on?

479
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I don't know.

480
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I really don't know.

481
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Did you lose the timing to be happy?

482
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You're being shy.

483
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
We were happy at first.

484
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
That may have happened.

485
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm sorry. I was the first one to say,

486
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I did it.

487
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I was happy.

488
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Let's go apologize.

489
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I'll be done here.

490
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
The picture was beautiful.

491
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Excuse me.

492
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Excuse me.

493
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Excuse me.

494
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:16,920
If you had to choose, would you say that you were happy that we won first place?

495
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,920
No, I wouldn't say that.

496
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,920
I'd say that it was too cold.

497
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,920
It was cold in many ways.

498
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,920
And I'd say, why did you guys get in the frame?

499
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I want to do it all by myself.

500
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I've been doing it a lot.

501
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Should I do a little of Harapan?

502
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
No, that's fine.

503
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
No, no.

504
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
It's fine.

505
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
I don't have to do it.

506
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Excuse me, but...

507
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
What is it?

508
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
What?

509
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
This one.

510
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
It's a vegan roller.

511
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Why is the vegan roller here?

512
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
I don't know.

513
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,920
You're too much. Your face is red.

514
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
It's not red at all.

515
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Will they succeed this time?

516
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
The fifth challenge.

517
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,920
This is the last one. Let's decide the best one.

518
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
We can do this.

519
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
It's okay.

520
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
That was the first shot.

521
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
That was the first.

522
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
It was already over.

523
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
He's in a good mood.

524
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
He's in a good mood.

525
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I'm sorry.

526
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
I'm not angry at all.

527
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
I'm not angry at all.

528
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
I see.

529
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,920
There are many things that happen at the end.

530
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
You get hit, you get hit and you turn around.

531
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Life is like a dark night.

532
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm not going to be the last one to get hit!

533
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Let's do it.

534
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm sorry.

535
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
I didn't have the ability to do it.

536
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I'm waiting for you again.

537
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Yes, yes.

538
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Please turn your face this way.

539
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Please lie down.

540
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm really not injured.

541
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Let's go.

542
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Please hold on to both sides.

543
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Hold on tight.

544
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Be careful.

545
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Please come in.

546
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Let's start.

547
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Hello.

548
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Okay.

549
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Hello.

550
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Okay, I got it.

551
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Please.

552
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Perfect.

553
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
There is nothing.

554
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Okay.

555
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Hello.

556
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Hello.

557
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Please.

558
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Is it okay to start here?

559
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
OK, let's start!

560
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Yeah!

561
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Yeah!

562
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah!

563
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Yeah!

564
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
That was good, wasn't it?

565
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
It's over.

566
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
He's sleeping.

567
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
