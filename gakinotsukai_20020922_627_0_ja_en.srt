1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time, we'll be visiting the idols of the next episode of Gaki no Tsukai!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Tama-chan, are you coming?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How do you feel about the time difference?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What do you mean by the time difference?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you go to see Tama-chan, you'll see the time difference.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's the time difference.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's the time difference?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We haven't seen it yet.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You want to see it?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You want to see it, right?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course!

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Of course!

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If it's Tama-chan, it's fine if she loses the popularity

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll accept the loss

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll accept the loss

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tama-chan!

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Suddenly appeared, Tama-chan who has become popular all over Japan

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Recently she has been in Yokohama and the world has become Tama-chan fever

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Tama-chan is going to meet a child's servant

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If we go anyway, it's not just us, it's a child too

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, that's great!

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a good thing.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We'll do something good, right?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's have them come up.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please come up!

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yay!

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you!

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If this was a normal version,

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
there would be a little kid and a little old man.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A little kid.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A real little kid.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's rare for kids to do this.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's rare.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How old are you?

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How many years are you in elementary school?

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Three years.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
3 years, 4 years.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can do it in 3 years too.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
4 years, 4 years.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's 4 years.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's okay.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This program was brought to you by the sponsors.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We're here!

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is the first time we're here, right Tama?

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I wonder if Tama-chan is here.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There are normal people but isn't it cool?

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's cool?

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't be silly.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not cool.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't think there is.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know if there is.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to see Tama-chan.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't think there is.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But there are 100 of them.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You have to see them.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't think there is.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There is.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's call them together.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Really?

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ready, set, go!

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Tama-chan!

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Stop it!

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's not cool.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not cool.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hey, you're weird.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Everyone's acting like idols.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm still laughing, but if you read it, it might come out.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ready, set, go!

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Stop it!

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Tama-chan!

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, that's not Tama-chan.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's not Tama-chan.

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's...

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hey.

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ah!

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ah!

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He's famous! He's famous!

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not famous!

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ice cream is so strange at this time!

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not strange!

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tama-chan, isn't he here today?

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tama-chan?

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's not here!

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Look! He's not here!

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is that so?

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's not here? Where did he go?

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I heard that he's seen a lot in the nearby center.

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Center?

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He's seen a lot!

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can see Tama-chan!

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can see her?

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes, I can see her.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go then.

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you very much.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you very much.

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is good information.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please do your best.

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Where is she?

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In the bathhouse.

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't understand. Why is Tama-chan in the bathhouse?

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know.

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's strange that a new girl is in the bathhouse.

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't say new girl. It's Tama-chan.

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's why.

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Here, here.

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, it's you.

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright, see you guys!

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll go take a look.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I want to see you.

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll be right there.

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Call me when you're there.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's wrong?

117
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's not here.

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Look at him.

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He's not here.

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's not here.

121
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you so angry?

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then, let's start from Tamagawa again.

124
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, no.

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's frustrating.

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey!

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What?

128
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey!

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Which one?

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hey!

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look! Look!

132
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's Tamagawa!

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's true!

134
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not!

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's Tamagawa!

136
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's Tamagawa!

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Shut up!

138
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
One, two!

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Tamagawa!

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's embarrassing, so stop it.

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I did it!

142
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I did it! Look at that!

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I did it!

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Say it!

145
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I did it!

146
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's embarrassing!

147
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's embarrassing, so stop it.

148
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wow, amazing!

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's different.

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why?

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, it disappeared.

152
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, it disappeared.

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's amazing.

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's good that you could see it.

155
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you going to do?

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Tama-chan

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Tama-chan?

158
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you find her, go to the Yabuya store

159
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's dangerous

160
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Really?

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Who asked you to do that?

162
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Who asked you to do that?

163
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yabuya-san

164
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go

165
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Where is Yabuya?

166
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's with that attitude?

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where?

168
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yabuya-san

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Tama-chan, Tama-chan.

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't have it.

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You were completely fooled.

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey, hey.

174
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You were completely fooled.

175
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

176
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, Yagura-san...

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go.

179
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go.

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's go.

181
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

182
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's wrong?

183
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

184
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Tama-chan is...

185
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Tama-chan.

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
One, two, three!

187
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Tama-chan!

188
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't say that!

189
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Listen to me, Tama-chan!

190
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're looking at me with those eyes!

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No, I'm not!

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're not!

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not looking at you!

194
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are!

195
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, I'm not!

196
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Huh?

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's gone.

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Huh?

199
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Excuse me, where did Tama-chan go?

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Tama-chan went to the bowling alley up ahead.

201
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please, old man!

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Bowling hall!

203
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's no way I can get better than this!

204
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can watch it over and over again!

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Right?

206
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The one watching that is cuter.

207
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That one is cute.

208
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That one is cute.

209
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hey!

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Isn't that Tama-chan?

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Bowling hall?

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Tama-chan!

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Tama-chan!

214
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tama-chan!

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, one, two!

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tama-chan!

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Tama-chan!

218
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Tama-chan!

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's not fair!

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ready, set...

221
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's not fair!

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ready, set...

223
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Tama-chan!

224
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow, amazing!

225
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm also a Tama-chan!

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Amazing! I'm so happy!

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is really Tama-chan!

228
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Really!

229
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Really...

230
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is that Tama-chan?

231
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Which one is it?

232
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's Tama-chan!

233
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not!

234
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ready, set...

235
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Tama-chan!

236
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not!

237
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's not, it's not

238
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

240
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's completely different

241
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

242
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's totally different

243
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There's no way there's a girl here

244
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's so cold

245
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's so cold!

246
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're so noisy

247
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Tama-chan!

248
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There are people here, and it's so noisy.

249
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't imagine going out.

250
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's impossible.

251
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There's no one over there.

252
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There's no one.

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go.

254
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go.

255
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go.

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You don't know?

257
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What happened?

258
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey!

259
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I got it!

260
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

261
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I got it!

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I got it!

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What happened?

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I got it!

265
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It was at number 66.

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Number 66?

267
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He threw it.

268
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

269
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,840
Sad

270
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
Ok booming new boy

271
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,640
Tom&

272
00:08:51,640 --> 00:09:06,340
Mahno

273
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
What?

274
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,300
Ok booming new boy

275
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Tama-chan!

276
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Tama-chan!

277
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Tama-chan!

278
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Wow, amazing!

279
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Amazing!

280
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
They moved, they moved!

281
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,300
They moved!

282
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Wow!

283
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Ready, set...

284
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Tama-chan!

285
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Shut up, you guys!

286
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
It's been a while since we've seen this.

287
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
They're moving so fast!

288
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Yeah!

289
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Is that really just one?

290
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
It's a family!

291
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Wow!

292
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Tama-chan, you are great!

293
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
We saw it!

294
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
It's great!

295
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Tama-chan!

296
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
What?

297
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
It's great!

298
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
It's great!

299
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
It's great!

300
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It's great!

301
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
It's great!

302
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Tama-chan!

303
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
It's great!

304
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Let's go!

305
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
The end

306
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
But when we started filming,

307
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
I didn't think we would see so much of Tama-chan.

308
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
I didn't think so.

309
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
It's the first time we've seen her.

310
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Let's go home.

311
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Let's go home.

312
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
It's great.

313
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Let's go home.

314
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
What?

315
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
What?

316
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
What?

317
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
What is this?

318
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
It's Tama-chan!

319
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
It's the pride of the group!

320
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
I'll do it with the people of the Eagle Bomb!

321
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Ready, set...

322
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Tama-chan!

323
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Tama-chan!

324
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
It's funny!

325
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
It's full of Tama-chan!

326
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Tama-chan!

327
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Amazing!

328
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
That's great!

329
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Hey!

330
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
What?

331
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Hey!

332
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Hey!

333
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Hey!

334
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Hey!

335
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
Hey!

336
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Hey!

337
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Hey!

338
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Hey!

339
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Hey!

340
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
The next day

341
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
The boy who is close to the baby

342
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Baby baby

343
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Baby baby

344
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Baby baby

345
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Baby baby

346
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Gari Gari

347
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
The next day

348
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Good evening

349
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Good evening

350
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Hello, good evening

351
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:38,300
The other day, I was having dinner with Kim and his junior, Chihara.

352
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
He asked me to go to a tea shop.

353
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,300
I asked him where he could find tea in this neighborhood.

354
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,300
He said, let's go to the place that is a little far from Harajuku.

355
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,300
I asked him where it is.

356
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
He said, I don't know.

357
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,300
I was wondering if I had been to Harajuku.

358
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,300
I was a little far from Omotesando.

359
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,300
I don't know where I was.

360
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
I said, I had been there three times.

361
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
I don't know.

362
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
It's hard to understand.

363
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I don't know if I've been to Harajuku.

364
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I said, let's go.

365
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I remember the car.

366
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
I was close to the car.

367
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
I stopped the car.

368
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
I said, I remember it!

369
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,300
I don't remember stopping my car here.

370
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
Everyone thought I was stupid.

371
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
But I was like, it's just a car.

372
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Because, you know, with me...

373
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
You have memories with me.

374
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I have memories with you.

375
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
I said, what is this?

376
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,300
I came here three times, I clearly remember that!

377
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
I said, this way!

378
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
And I walked like this.

379
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
I've never seen anything like this.

380
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
I thought.

381
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
I said, well, well, well, look at it later, look at it later.

382
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Ah, excuse me, here it is.

383
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
I said, I'll definitely say it.

384
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
It doesn't turn here.

385
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
I turned around and looked at it, and it was gone.

386
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
It was gone, but it was in Okonomiyachi.

387
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,300
I said, huh? It's gone.

388
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
I said, really?

389
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Was there?

390
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,300
I was like, was there a satin?

391
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,300
He treated me like a fool.

392
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
I was so annoyed.

393
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
I told him that there was a satin.

394
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
I told him to come.

395
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
I went in and said,

396
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,300
excuse me, this was a satin shop about 8 months ago, right?

397
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
He said, yes.

398
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Look!

399
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I said, look, there's a counter in the movie theater, and I remembered that it was here.

400
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
He said, I don't remember at all.

401
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
I said, why?

402
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,300
He said, excuse me, I don't know the contact information of the master of the pizza shop.

403
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
He said, I don't remember.

404
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
I said, I don't remember.

405
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
He said, if you look for it, you might know.

406
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
He said, look for it. I want to contact you.

407
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
These three are here.

408
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,300
I said, wait a minute, I want to find a lot of small ones.

409
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
I remembered!

410
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
I said, I've been here three times!

411
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I said, I'll come to Yamashita now.

412
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Oh!

413
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Well, that's the way it is.

414
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
I said, I'll come to Yamashita now!

415
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Well, that's the way it is.

416
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,300
I said, I'll contact the old man in the main building.

417
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
I was like, wow, that's a lot of calls!

418
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
That's enough.

419
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
That's enough, but I wasn't ready for that.

420
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I was already drawn to it.

421
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I was like, I'll call them later and tell them to clean up properly.

422
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
I was like, let's go to a different place.

423
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I was like, you guys are hopeless!

424
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
You weren't wearing any of those?

425
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
I didn't say a word.

426
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
It's cold.

427
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm getting a bit of a blur.

428
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
But there are things like that, right?

429
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
There are things like that, right?

430
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Everyone's talking and...

431
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,300
When did you hear that?

432
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
You're saying it like it's new information.

433
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,300
It's like, do you know?

434
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
That's a lot of Yamazaki.

435
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
You're the one who asked.

436
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
You said something like a comedy to me!

437
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
I told you twice!

438
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm sorry.

439
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
You didn't say it until the end.

440
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

441
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I didn't say it.

442
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
It's embarrassing.

443
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I think the people in Okonomiyaki were surprised.

444
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
You said it that much?

445
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I suddenly came in and I was very angry.

446
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,300
I thought I'd do something really stupid.

447
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Well, well, you have to be careful. You're already 40.

448
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
You should be careful.

449
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:14,300
I said it earlier, but when you get to this age, you'll be left with the same tiredness as the day before.

450
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
That's a big deal.

451
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,300
No, no, no. I'm not tired. I'm still tired. I did something yesterday and I'm still tired.

452
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
You're still tired.

453
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Oh, really?

454
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Yes.

455
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
And that's why you're tired.

456
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
I'm tired!

457
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
What did you do yesterday that made you feel sick?

458
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
What?

459
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
What did you do yesterday that made you feel sick?

460
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
What did I do?

461
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Don't be so sick!

462
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Masumoto-san, please tell us how to get into the gray zone.

463
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
How to get into the gray zone?

464
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Ah, there are many ways.

465
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
There are no ways.

466
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
You can't get in.

467
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
I can get in.

468
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
How did you get in?

469
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Well, I'm in various studios, you know.

470
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I'm in various studios, you know.

471
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I can go to those places, you know.

472
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I can go to those places, you know.

473
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
No.

474
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
I can go to those places, you know.

475
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,300
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I can't get in, can I?

477
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I can take a bar-like thing and...

478
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
No.

479
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,300
I want to say that.

480
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I want to say that.

481
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm not.

482
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
You've been doing it with 4 people, but you've done it with 5 people.

483
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
No, that's not true.

484
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
So you're good at it.

485
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
If you say that, we call it downtown.

486
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
What's downtown?

487
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Two old men are doing it.

488
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,300
If you say that you want to go downtown, I don't want to stop you.

489
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
With 3 people or 4 people.

490
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
It's hard to do.

491
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Three people?

492
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I can do it all by myself.

493
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,300
I don't need two people for that.

494
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I know that.

495
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
But this is not good.

496
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I don't know about the gray.

497
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Why? Because there is a part of the instrument.

498
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Yes, there is.

499
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,300
What do you want to add and what do you want to remove?

500
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Why do you think that the gray should be four people?

501
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,300
No, I don't feel uncomfortable if one person enters.

502
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
If you say that, it's a f***ing f***er.

503
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
One person left and another one joined.

504
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I don't care about that.

505
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Your way of saying it is f***ing f***er.

506
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,300
If you say that, there is no one in the CC Girls anymore.

507
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
You are the first one.

508
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
You are completely changed.

509
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Well, that's like the read-and-sell giant army.

510
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
What?

511
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,300
There are no former Titans.

512
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
There are Titans and Shishi.

513
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,300
And there is also a pirate.

514
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
I don't know.

515
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
I have been doing this for a long time.

516
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
If a person enters the game,

517
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I think the person watching TV will be surprised.

518
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I think so.

519
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
I think so.

520
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I think I can't enter the game.

521
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
I think I'm fine.

522
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Really?

523
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
I'm asking you.

524
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm not asking you to borrow money, I'm asking you to teach me properly.

525
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
How to get in.

526
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm asking you now, how to get in.

527
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm asking you to borrow money.

528
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
The best way to get in is to have a disciple.

529
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
The question is who to ask.

530
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Who should I ask?

531
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
A disciple of Grey.

532
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Someone like Amagappa.

533
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I think it's the worst.

534
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Why?

535
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Why? The leader is a genius.

536
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
You're not a genius. You're not a genius.

537
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
You wrote the poem yourself, right?

538
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
There's a harsh part.

539
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
It's a sweet cup.

540
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
If you put out a cucumber...

541
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm sorry.

542
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Your hair is like that, so it's not like you're a cucumber.

543
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
It's not a cucumber.

544
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
It's okay.

545
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
You don't have to be so excited.

546
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,300
It's okay.

547
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
You have to be a takuro to express yourself.

548
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
In Amagappa.

549
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
But if Amagappa says it, it's no use being a takuro.

550
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
What's with takuro? Don't just come in.

551
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
It's like that.

552
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
I said, I'm sorry.

553
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
He only read the sweet words.

554
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
No, you're getting angry. Go home.

555
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
He said, Porin Porin from Ki.

556
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Why did you hide it?

557
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Why did I hide it?

558
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
There are hundreds of wounds on Matsumoto's whole body.

559
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
He remembers everything, who was which and who was which.

560
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Ah, yes, yes.

561
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,300
What is the third scar between the split of the butt?

562
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
That is...

563
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
The queen of Gotanda.

564
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Pah!

565
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
It's recent.

566
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
The queen of Eri.

567
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
This guy is so stupid.

568
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
This is the Queen of the Uguizudani.

569
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Hey, stop it!

570
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
You only talk about the Queen.

571
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,300
You don't even talk about the one who fought with someone.

572
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
You only talk about the Queen of Gisa.

573
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I can't accept all of that.

574
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Are you saying that you are fighting?

575
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I'll tell you, but there is no such thing.

576
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
What?

577
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I'll tell you the truth.

578
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Wait, wait, wait!

579
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm really not!

580
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I'm not a bug!

581
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I know that!

582
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
What do you mean you're not a bug?

583
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Sometimes there are people who really think so.

584
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm not a bug or a candle, I don't use words.

585
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
What do you mean?

586
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Everyone is mistaken.

587
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
If I say something like this, you will take it seriously.

588
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
I have a chikubi and a kanji as much as you think.

589
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Don't you know what a chikubi and a kanji are?

590
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
I have a chikubi and a kanji as much as you think.

591
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
I don't think so.

592
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
I have a kanji as much as you think.

593
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
But even if you don't have a position, everyone thinks so.

594
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I think so.

595
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
That's a really big mistake.

596
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
But I think M is M.

597
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
M is M, M is M, but even if you go to the sex life, you do it with your nipples.

598
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
It's not like that.

599
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I don't know what you think.

600
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,300
I say something like, it's not like that.

601
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,300
Please make it a conversation.

602
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
It fits like anything.

603
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
And I can't even speak.

604
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I'm serious!

605
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
I hate you!

606
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I can't even laugh!

607
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Ah, I see.

608
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I understand that.

609
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
I'll do a little skit.

610
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
You can't get into it, can you?

611
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Yes, yes, yes.

612
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I'll do it however I want.

613
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
But surprisingly, I can read the paper.

614
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Ah, the words?

615
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
I can't even think!

616
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,300
I don't know what will happen next.

617
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
If that happens, I can't do it at all.

618
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I can't do it.

619
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
I'll destroy it.

620
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
The 80 minute course.

621
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
It's long.

622
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Can't you just let me see it?
