1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first episode of the Gaki no Tsukai Arai, the next is Endo vs Jinnai, the real daikon actor, Cho Jiro's strategy!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a close battle.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It doesn't matter if it's a strategy or not.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you want me to do?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today, we're going to decide the top of the daikon actor.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right. Well, I got the word from Jiro Sato.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, I see.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The other day, we broadcasted a quiz about the 100 of Jiro Sato

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who do you think is the most daikon among the 5?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll say it bluntly

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Endo-san

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I did it!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I can remember his anger

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Endo's daikon acting is a masterpiece

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
From now on, I will be the bassist of this bus.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The bassist of the movie, which was starring Shouzo Endo, has returned.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That means...

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Alright, we don't have time. Let's hurry.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
His smelly acting is worthy of the top of the list of great actors.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No way!

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shouzo knows it.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Jinnai...

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ah, this is...

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've been paying attention to Jinnai.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Before Nagoya, I was in a drama about Nagoya.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It was a long time ago.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was a serious drama.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But every time, I was like a gay.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You were like a gay in the drama?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was like I was going to throw up something I didn't eat.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Here it is.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't go home today.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The drama played by Tomonori Jinnai as the main cast, Cinderella Date

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is my favorite shop in the world

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I came here after I submitted my application to the district office

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The second year was right after I opened my own office

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I slipped into the home and fell down with a catcher

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The doctor said it's not good yet, but I left immediately

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I couldn't help it because I wanted to eat the beef tail red wine here

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A splendid daikon acting that reads lines without a break

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I look forward to the next 10 years

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is Asia 1 and 2

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's amazing

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's amazing that two people are gathered in Japan

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's amazing

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And they are from the same company

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They are from the same company

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a miracle

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's have the two main characters appear

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're welcome.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Excuse me, Jinna-san.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You look like you're in a deep sea.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What do you mean by gay?

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I've done it before.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a serious role of Cinderella date.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's about the role of the third.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you know about it?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know about it.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I saw the play with my ex-wife.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was gay.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You were.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I see.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Really?

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think it's a commercial, but I saw the commercial and I got goose bumps.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everyone got goose bumps.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Everyone.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When you come out, you act like you're not on the stage.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's not good.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're already doing it.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's not good.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't agree with that! You should act!

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You shouldn't say that!

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Endo-senpai is also acting like he's in trouble

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you say that, you won't be able to do anything

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's hard to do!

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:03:44,820
Why are you wearing a

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
I'll do it!

82
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
You can't say that!

83
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Endo-senpai is also worried about that.

84
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
If you say that, you can't do anything.

85
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
It's hard to do.

86
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
It's hard to do.

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
The next episode

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,820
The next episode

89
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
Why are you wearing a mask today?

90
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,820
We're going to shoot a performance for you two.

91
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
This time, the theme is the period drama.

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
The video is black and white.

93
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
It's black.

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
It's a little like that.

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,820
Endo and Jinnai filmed the same scene in advance.

96
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,820
The acting was re-enacted by the members.

97
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,820
The one with the lowest total score will be the unknown King of Daikon.

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,820
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
I did it seriously.

100
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Are you confident?

101
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Of course I am.

102
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Let's watch it seriously.

103
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,820
The first scene is the revenge scene.

104
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
The revenge scene...

105
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
It's a period drama.

106
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
It's a classic.

107
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
It's a classic.

108
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
It means that he's going to die.

109
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Let's see the performance from Yen-提香 played by Seppo.

110
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,220
Look at his face.

111
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:15,600
оз

112
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,780
Seppo

113
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:43,220
Joined under the

114
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:49,940
income from winning the war

115
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,940
sunny

116
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:58,460
I am doing it.

117
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,480
was

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
If you are saved,

119
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,480
I will be happy and cut off my belly.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
What kind of face is that?

121
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
That's not the face.

122
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,480
I will cut off my belly.

123
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
What kind of face is that?

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Is he going to come out of the forest?

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Lastly,

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I want to read the book of the next life.

127
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
I will do it.

128
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Do you want to do it?

129
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Is that right?

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Yes.

131
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Very well.

132
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Like a thorn in my side,

133
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,480
even if my body is to die,

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I will be a flower

135
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
that will never wither.

136
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
That's strange.

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
He's doing it seriously.

138
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Why is he laughing?

139
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Really.

140
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Finally...

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Too much emotion...

142
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Ah, I see.

143
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
It's going to be like this.

144
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Too much emotion makes it smelly?

145
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
It's going in.

146
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:03,460
It's like a

147
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
It doesn't matter.

148
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
It's a body type.

149
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
It's like a golf club.

150
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Can you stop looking at me like that?

151
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
This is a period drama.

152
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I will stop it.

153
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Hurry up and say it.

154
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
It's a curse.

155
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
I will stop it.

156
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
I don't know what you're saying.

157
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
I will stop it.

158
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
I will stop it.

159
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,980
Eh?

160
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Please look at it.

161
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,480
What do you mean by look at it?

162
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Please look at it.

163
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Let me do it.

164
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm hesitating.

165
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
This is bad.

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
What is this?

167
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
This is bad.

168
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
This is bad.

169
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
This is bad.

170
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm going home.

171
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
This is what happens.

172
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Do it seriously.

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I'm seriously serious.

174
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,480
I'm not laughing. I'm serious.

175
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,480
This is amazing.

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,480
This is terrible.

177
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,480
What are you saying?

178
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
No!

179
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I don't regret it.

180
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
I don't regret it in my life.

181
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,480
When you're in that kind of situation, do you get angry?

182
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Because you're angry.

183
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
You get angry, right?

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I've been doing the drift all the time.

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I can hear the laughter.

186
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
The laughter of the old ladies.

187
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,480
I don't do the drift in the set-up scene.

188
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Everyone, it's a little judgment.

189
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
It's difficult.

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
How about this?

191
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Everyone, please put your cards together.

192
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Total minus 4.

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Minus 4.

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm suddenly feeling a bit...

195
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Is this a debt start?

196
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
How do you feel now, Jinnai-san?

197
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
I think I made a mistake in my expression

198
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,980
I see

199
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I thought I was like this when I was hungry

200
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
I was able to come up with a good acting plan

201
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Why did you come up with this?

202
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
It's so funny.

203
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
It's so funny.

204
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Jinnai Tomonoshi.

205
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,460
I hereby appeal to you, Supreme Ministers...

206
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,140
I,ríSeph

207
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,040
Seph

208
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,740
You will be something very blessed

209
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
And by you death...

210
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,080
If the Kashi's slimseed were to survive...

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,240
I'd like to allocated the flesh, my lord.

212
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,400
Now, for the sake of Jinnai's lordship,

213
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,780
perdu pursuance!

214
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,640
skys stroke sate I'll

215
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,020
residents have made Mayor to read the places for emergent system toppings.

216
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,100
You haven't bit on his finger yet, have ya.

217
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
It's good.

218
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
It's like a movie.

219
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
For the country,

220
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,100
the heart that is devoted to the country is a water bowl.

221
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Don't get lost,

222
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
leave it to the wind.

223
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
He has a good face.

224
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Not bad.

225
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I'll catch you!

226
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
From here on out, right?

227
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
That's the face of a real man.

228
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
This life...

229
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,100
And now, I will end this!

230
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Go-Shōran!

231
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
What?

232
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
What?

233
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
What?

234
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
What?

235
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Go-Shōran!

236
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
What?

237
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
This is bad.

238
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
This is bad.

239
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
What?

240
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
What is this?

241
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Waaaaa!

242
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Waaa!

243
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
That is so funny!

244
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
You didn't have to laugh.

245
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
I didn't laugh at all.

246
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
The one who said, waaaaa!

247
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
It was like an elementary school student.

248
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Waaaaa!

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
It was like that.

250
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
The sports day has started.

251
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
What is it?

252
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Let's judge

253
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
It's a lie, right?

254
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
It's a lie

255
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
This is a lie

256
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
I'll take it

257
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
It's a lie

258
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Why did you laugh at the end?

259
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
What did you laugh at?

260
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
What are you doing?

261
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
That's dangerous

262
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
That's not true

263
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
It's a lie

264
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Next is the scene of the poison

265
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
It was a scene of poison.

266
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Poison?

267
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Poison was poured into a very fun place and he drank it.

268
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
He died in pain.

269
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
It's hard.

270
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
It's hard.

271
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
It's a tension from the inside of the body.

272
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
That's right.

273
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Hahaha!

274
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
It's time for the Lord.

275
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
I see.

276
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Thanks to the great command of the Lord, we have won this battle.

277
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Now our country is safe.

278
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:41,420
Listen, our country's

279
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
The war has just begun.

280
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
The Tengadori is just beginning.

281
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,100
I will crush those who hinder my progress.

282
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
That's a bit of a slur.

283
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Come on, let's drink.

284
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Sorry.

285
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Let's drink tonight!

286
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Here you go!

287
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Drink it! Drink it!

288
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
This is a break-up!

289
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
He's holding it!

290
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
This is crazy!

291
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
This is crazy!

292
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
He's holding it!

293
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
He's holding it!

294
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
He's holding it!

295
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Wow, Yuki!

296
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Don't fool around!

297
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Scary! Scary! Scary!

298
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Scary, scary, scary.

299
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
You've gone too far!

300
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
It's like a one-eye again.

301
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
You're so mean.

302
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
You've been destroyed by the Jinnai family.

303
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
This is the grudge of our clan!

304
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Wait!

305
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
You bastard!

306
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
You bastard!

307
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
I'm not going to die!

308
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I can't die like this!

309
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
You're a fool.

310
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
I'm not going to die!

311
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

312
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

313
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Ah, it stopped.

314
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,100
His acting is amazing, and his actions are also amazing.

315
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,100
He was poisoned, but why did he drink it again?

316
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
It's like a holy soup.

317
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
He should have checked it again.

318
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
No, no!

319
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Because when you say, um, it makes you go, um, right?

320
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
What?

321
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Where?

322
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Even more so, you can't do it.

323
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
So what did you do?

324
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What?

325
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
It's not strange, so I went twice.

326
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,100
The second time of poison is a problem, and the score is a minus 17 points.

327
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Endo, can you break away from them at once?

328
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Thanks to your excellent command, we have won this battle.

329
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Now this country is safe.

330
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Alright, the trouble in our country has just begun.

331
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
It stinks.

332
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
It's starting now.

333
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
It stinks.

334
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
It's the smell of heaven.

335
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
It stinks.

336
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
It stinks.

337
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
You're blocking my way.

338
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
It's not coming.

339
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
You're being merciless.

340
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:44,120
It's a

341
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
You're a liar.

342
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
The way you act stinks.

343
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
It stinks?

344
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Well, well, well, I'll let you drink tonight.

345
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
What?

346
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,880
He yes...

347
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Your order surely

348
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,020
from here

349
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,420
That kind of guy

350
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
It's regular

351
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
It's fun

352
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
What the heck was that?

353
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,880
Revenge successful!

354
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,880
Why isn't he arriving in the walls?

355
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,880
He fell for it.

356
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
What the hell?!

357
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
You!

358
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
You're stinking.

359
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
You...

360
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
You know that, right?

361
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
You're the one who's been destroyed by the Edo family, and you're the one who's been against our family!

362
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
I'm going to take off my sword and...

363
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
Stop!

364
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
You're so annoying.

365
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
You...

366
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,080
I'll cut you into pieces.

367
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,080
That's too serious.

368
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
There's no hole.

369
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
It's too much.

370
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
There's a lot of them.

371
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
It's too much.

372
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
There's a lot.

373
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
There's a lot of them.

374
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
You must have seen a lot of things.

375
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,080
I did all of it.

376
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
All of it?

377
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
The scene where the old man dies.

378
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
It was smelly.

379
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I don't like the smell.

380
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
What do you think?

381
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
That was just a skit.

382
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
It was just a skit.

383
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,080
But you were a grown man, you were a bit mean.

384
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
You could tell.

385
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
You could tell, right?

386
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,080
I was looking for contact lenses

387
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
You were looking for it

388
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,080
You were looking for the camera

389
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I dodged it

390
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
I didn't do it like this

391
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,080
I dodged it

392
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
The acting was too much

393
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
It was negative 12 points and low rating

394
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Jin-san is outstanding

395
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
That's right

396
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
It's a bit...

397
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
It's a bit...

398
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
I don't have a taste

399
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
And it's not a VTR

400
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
It's a fire show

401
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
It's a live-action show

402
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
It's scary

403
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Next is a live-action show battle with only facial expressions

404
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
He can't be defeated by a period drama.

405
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,080
He will continue to act with a big smile, a mischievous smile, and a angry face for 10 seconds.

406
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Endo-san, how is it?

407
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I'm thinking about which one to give him.

408
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Let's go. First, Endo-san's big smile.

409
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Action!

410
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Action!

411
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Action!

412
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
You bastard!

413
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,080
I will never let you live!

414
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Let's go to the judgement, everyone.

415
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I'm sorry, but you're the bad guy.

416
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
I hate you!

417
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Next is Jinnai. First is his big smile.

418
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Action!

419
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:30,160
Hahaha

420
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,200
Action!

421
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,600
Action!

422
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,520
You bastard!

423
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
You bastard!

424
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
You bastard!

425
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
I won't forgive you!

426
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
This is Yama-chan.

427
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
He's gone crazy.

428
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Do it properly!

429
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Do it properly!

430
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
You're being called!

431
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Let's see the judgement.

432
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Ready, go!

433
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
It's not enough.

434
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
What do you mean it's not enough?

435
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,520
The one who got 51 points is Jinnai!

436
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Jinnai is not a good opponent.

437
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I want to see him fight again.

438
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
What do you think about this result?

439
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I think it's a natural result.

440
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
I think it's about 20 points.

441
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Jinnai's 32 points.

442
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
It's a minus. Both of them are minus points.

443
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
It's not fair to say that it's the result of the competition.

444
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm so nervous.

445
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
E.B.C.

446
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
This face.

447
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Is that so?

448
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,020
This is a really good face.

449
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm sleepy.

450
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Sleepy.

451
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
This face is sleepy.

452
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
It's sleepy.

453
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I'm sleepy.

454
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
He's glaring at me.

455
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm sleepy.

456
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
I should move my eyebrows.

457
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
That's right.

458
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,520
It's like this.

459
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
This is strange.

460
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
This is strange.

461
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Can you take it?

462
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
What is it?

463
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Kato Cha-san.

464
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Cha-san.

465
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Really.

466
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
I haven't played Drill Daibakutou.

467
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,520
His face is similar to Chaa-san's.

468
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
He looks like Da-Funda.

469
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Chaa-san's face is similar to Endo's.

470
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,520
He was Kato Chaa-san at the end.

471
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Mori-san and Chaa-san.

472
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
They are just changing their faces.

473
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,520
The way he stands before he gets cut is like Takeshi-san.

474
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
There are many people.

475
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Ah!

476
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,020
Ahhhh!

477
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Why startled me?

478
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,520
The previous bout is now broadcasted zww by Hulu.
