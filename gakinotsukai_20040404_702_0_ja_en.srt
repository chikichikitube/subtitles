1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You're late

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You're late

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You're slacking off

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're late

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sorry

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You're late

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sorry, the other person was late

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I thought you were late

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I thought it was about time

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's strange

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We should have come earlier

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sorry

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You didn't tell them about today's call?

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can say this.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm in my teens, and I just graduated from high school.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's young.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You just graduated?

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, I just graduated.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And I'm told that I like young men.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're young?

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're not that young.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I were, I would have quit.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't think I need to stop.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How long will it take?

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
About an hour.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What?

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a bit too long.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
An hour?

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think I'll just stay here for an hour.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think I'll head home.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll go home for an hour.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My house is close.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think so.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then, at 5 o'clock...

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
5 o'clock.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to be back at 5 o'clock.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you can come back at 5 o'clock.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
18 o'clock...

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know what to do.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you have time, you can call me.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't mind.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even if you suddenly quit, I'll be back.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then, at 5 o'clock.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
At 5 o'clock.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you have a meeting?

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, we have 5 people.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So you have 5 people.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry, but I might not be able to make it.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I might not be able to spend much time.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll call you again.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Excuse me.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's 5 o'clock.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, it's 5 o'clock.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then, let's go have some tea.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can drink here.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to drink delicious coffee.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you have time?

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have time.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to the pizza shop.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, I'll be there.

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then, I'll go out.

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're going out?

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going to go to the temple.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, it's still just me.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's so cold.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's been an hour.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're not here?

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It was hard to keep track of time.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's cold.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What? It's cold.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I thought I'd get wet in the car passing by.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought I'd never see her again.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I need a break.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're so slow.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't think so.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think it's too young.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I thought I'd quit.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But I can't destroy my license.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Your juniors are doing it on purpose.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I wonder if he'll like it.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't think so.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was in my teens.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You were in your teens.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why would you come to my place?

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't think so.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You were in your teens.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you have a forestry shop?

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We have a forestry shop.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Please go there.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What do you mean by a forestry shop?

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Where are you going?

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're late.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're late.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're faster than us.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Zaki-san too?

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I haven't seen him yet.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Only Yama-chan?

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, only Zaki-san.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's the same.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's the age difference?

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
9...8 or 19.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, he's the only one who talks and moves.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's up with you?

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're still not here?

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, I'm not.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, that's good.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're late again.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm not here anymore.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's okay.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I was thinking of going home.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But you're not here at all.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, really?

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I thought I'd go to the hospital.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But it's bad.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's bad for your license.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's the only thing I'm sorry about.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I'm a teenager.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ah, it's so cold.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll wait for another minute and then I'll go home.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're going home?

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Ah, you're here.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sorry.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're so annoying.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sorry.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I just got a call from a girl.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She said she was going to cancel today.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What?

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sorry.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
There's this girl called Miki-chan.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,500
But that girl couldn't come because she had some business.

150
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
What do you mean?

151
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
There's no other girl, then?

152
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,000
So, there was something like that, so I had it prepared.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What do you mean?

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You had it prepared?

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I had it prepared, but...

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
I have someone I'm going to see.

157
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
That's fine.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
5 people?

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, 5 people.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But you can't just go like that.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
But you're going to see her, right?

162
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
She's a bad person.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're the one who's bad.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Call her.

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not going to call her.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you're going to call her, that's your fault.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're the ones who are bad.

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I really only did what I could to break the face of RIZENS.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You should read it.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a beautiful girl.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She likes an artistic man.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What do you think?

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a bit complicated.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It is, isn't it?

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not a big deal.

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's complicated, but the face is really cute.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Here.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ah, I see.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's not what I meant.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What was it again?

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll say it as soon as possible.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think...

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The contact is off.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's off.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Somewhere.

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Did you get in contact?

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going somewhere. I'll go home for now.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In about an hour?

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes, in about an hour.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not allowed to come in.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry. I don't have a license.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're in the 8th floor, right?

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I wonder if it's the 8th floor.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's exactly 8 o'clock.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's about 6 o'clock.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sorry.

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sorry for the trouble.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to go.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Really?

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going home.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The client is coming.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll be in trouble if I make a mistake.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm going.

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sorry.

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's OK.

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll be back at 6.

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
OK.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If he comes, I won't be able to come.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I won't be able to wait.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Sorry.

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think there are 5 people.

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think there are 4 people.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Sorry.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm not going to be here.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I've always wanted to eat at this restaurant.

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's ask them if they want to eat.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not that much less now.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll spend some time here.

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll just eat a little.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll just eat a little.

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes, sir.

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Excuse me.

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sleepy.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,700
Shin Data

233
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Unaware of what's going on, S Ren comes to work in>-

234
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,980
Family

235
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:38,980
I'm sleepy.

236
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
You made nightshade?

237
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,200
... those are the times when I got those.

238
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
— Look at this, man... — This is a closer look.

239
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
I hate this the most.

240
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,880
I was sleeping.

241
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I want to go home.

242
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
You're right.

243
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,880
I thought I was going to get angry.

244
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
The literally last grandma

245
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I can't do this.

246
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
I can't do this.

247
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm not good at this kind of stuff.

248
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
I don't like you.

249
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
I don't know.

250
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
What's up?

251
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
What's up?

252
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Come in.

253
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I was thinking of going home.

254
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Yeah.

255
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Hamada-san said he might not come.

256
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I understand.

257
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
He might be back at 5.4.

258
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Hamada-san is coming?

259
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Wait a minute.

260
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
It's nothing.

261
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
It doesn't matter if it's Gordon or not.

262
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,880
It's just the face of the normal license.

263
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
Huh?

264
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Is it here?

265
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Who is it?

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
No, I don't think so.

267
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
I think he might not come today.

268
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Oh, really?

269
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Hamada!

270
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Oh, Mr. Hamada?

271
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Oh, here.

272
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh, here.

273
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
You came.

274
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
What?

275
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
You said you might not come.

276
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Oh.

277
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Well,

278
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
There was nothing there.

279
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Where was the toilet?

280
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Where was the toilet?

281
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
I think it was in the back.

282
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
What is this?

283
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I'm making a song right now.

284
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
This?

285
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Sex music?

286
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Someone is coming in.

287
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
What are you doing?

288
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
It's a Japanese-style scene.

289
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Well, it's fine.

290
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
I don't want to do this anymore.

291
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
If I get invited to this kind of thing again, I'll refuse.

292
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Is it not time yet?

293
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
It's not time yet.

294
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Huh?

295
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Sanlona?

296
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I don't think the number of people is right.

297
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Are you a university student?

298
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm a university student.

299
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Here he comes.

300
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
He's here.

301
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Your license!

302
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
I don't have it.

303
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,880
You can't just come here.

304
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
What should I do?

305
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Oh we see!

306
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm going to the end.

307
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
You're going to the end?

308
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm going to the end.

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Can you go and tell them?

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I'll go and tell them.

311
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
I'll go and tell them.

312
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's just go and check.

313
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
There's no mistake.

314
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
That's right.

315
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
You can take that.

316
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
What?

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
You can take that.

318
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
I see.

319
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
How is it?

320
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Can I just check?

321
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
It's definitely a witness.

322
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Well, it's like a witness.

323
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Yes.

324
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
License?

325
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
No, no.

326
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
No, I mean...

327
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,880
A license to eat with a big mouth.

328
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Then that's why you are weird.

329
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
You are really weird.

330
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
You are the worst.

331
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
The worst.

332
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

333
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
What? What? What?

334
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Tell him that he's not related to this.

335
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
This has nothing to do with this.

336
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
It has nothing to do with this.

337
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
What? What?

338
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Are you the main protagonist?

339
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
What?

340
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
That's the worst!

341
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm not doing it.

342
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
That's the worst.

343
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm not doing it.

344
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
You're really cool.

345
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
You're slow!

346
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
What are you doing?

347
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
What are you doing?

348
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
What happened?

349
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
What happened?

350
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
He refused again.

351
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
What?

352
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,880
He said he found a scene he wanted to draw on the way here.

354
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
That's not true.

355
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
He said that.

356
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
No, no, no.

357
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
He didn't say anything.

358
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
No, I didn't say anything.

359
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Did he say he was coming?

360
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Yes.

361
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Yes, he did.

362
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Did he really say that?

363
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Yes.

364
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Yes.

365
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
He said he would come even if it was a lie.

366
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
He did?

367
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Yes, he did.

368
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
And the four of us.

369
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
He said he would come when we were playing.

370
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh, really?

371
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
What?

372
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
What is this?

373
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, I see.

374
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Oh, it's like this.

375
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
What should I do?

376
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Everyone is so sweet.

377
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
The beautiful voice.

378
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
It's a bit empty.

379
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I've seen the Jura. I'm aware of it.

380
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Well, I'll let you do that.

381
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Then, I'll go ask.

382
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Go ahead.

383
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Excuse me.

384
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Well...

385
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Ah, I don't know.

386
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Look.

387
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
What?

388
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Ah, yes.

389
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Look closely.

390
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Look.

391
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Look.

392
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
It's not weird.

393
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Look.

394
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
I don't know.

395
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I don't know.

396
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
I don't know.

397
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,880
No, no, no.

398
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Excuse me.

399
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
What's your name?

400
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
You're not supposed to say that.

401
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
It's not gross.

402
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Gross?

403
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Yes.

404
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Who is gross?

405
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Who is gross?

406
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Who are you talking to?

407
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I'm talking to the whole team.

408
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,880
I heard what you said about Rises, but it's not gross.

409
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I can prepare another one, but...

410
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
I'm an OL.

411
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm an OL for a first-class company.

412
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
You're a person who knows the upper class.

413
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Yes.

414
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,880
But I don't know if it's because I work in a hard place, but...

415
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,880
I like men with wild tastes.

416
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
That's right. I'm sorry.

417
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
I'll stop.

418
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
It's not like that.

419
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
It's just that this time is hard.

420
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
What do you mean?

421
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
It's confusing, right?

422
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
It's hard, right?

423
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
What about their faces?

424
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
They're so cute.

425
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
It's strange to say that they're cute, but they're not.

426
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
They're not.

427
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
I don't understand the meaning.

428
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
That's right.

429
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Then what is it?

430
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Then we're not gonna have to match like that.

431
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
That's not what I mean.

432
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
What are you doing?

433
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
You're making fun of me.

434
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
You're so stupid.

435
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm busy.

436
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Come here.

437
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Good.

439
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Is he still here?

440
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Not yet.

441
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Was it too early?

442
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
I think he'll be here soon.

443
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
I don't know.

444
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm hungry.

445
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Oh....

446
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,880
How long has it been?

447
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Not yet.

448
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Oh, really?

449
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Not yet?

450
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Not yet.

451
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Not yet.

452
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Too slow.

455
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,880
It's slow.

456
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Not yet.

457
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Not yet.

458
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Not yet.

459
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,880
It's hot.

460
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm not done yet.

461
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
You're not done yet?

462
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
I have to steal the boy instead.
