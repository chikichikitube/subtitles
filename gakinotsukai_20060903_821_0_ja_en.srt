1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The usual music room

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What's up?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What are you doing?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nothing. I'm in the past.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is that?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is amazing.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a celebrity safari park.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is that?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is this?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I didn't say anything.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It says, please enjoy the entertainers who are active at night.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When you drive a car, you can meet a lot of entertainers.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Really?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If it's normal, it's normal.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It says, please get close to the entertainers who are powerful.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's hard to understand.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's all about meaning.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So you can go by your own car.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Like a night safari.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lock the door and never get out of the car.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's a cameraman?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So you're like an animal?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Like a lion or a tiger.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, no.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But you're interested in this, right?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, if you have it now, you won't make it.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you have it now, you won't make it.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you use the highway, you won't make it.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you going?

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I should go.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to see it.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I should go.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The opening I was going to do today is also a mess.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I quit.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not thinking about that.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Do you always think about the opening of a mess?

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If that's the case, let's stop.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I want to go.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm fine.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to drive.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Really?

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to go.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is amazing.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's amazing if it's real.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I feel something.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's so hot.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What is this?

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's so hot.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is the house.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's open.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is it.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's open.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a celebrity's safari car.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's so well made.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It doesn't feel salty at all.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is my first time seeing this.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is this really possible?

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is this?

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A person who receives the night safari and receives the guidance of the park.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The park will proceed according to the guidance of the park.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's okay to stay like this, right?

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please put it in front of the car.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In front of the car, right?

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Then let's go.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So you will guide us?

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm looking forward to it

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you recording?

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, we are

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's OK

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't want to be late

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you for coming to the entertainment park today

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There are many celebrities in the park

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please don't go out

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Please enjoy the entertainment park.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How much is this? 20kg?

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is not good.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't see it.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm a little nervous.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Was it 1000 yen?

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
1400 yen.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It depends on the price.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It depends on the entertainer.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,220
Sh倉回 Understood, I see that.

88
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,260
By Buddhism is the same as the human race is, so it seems to know, But Iweight people are possible.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are also many places is express,

90
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,000
Did you feel gone as well,

91
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,000
It comes with a lost.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is this a celebrity?

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Stop it.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who is this?

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who is this?

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Who is this?

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Umezu Sakae

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
His main job is a stage actor.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He is known for his overalls and his coolness.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He looks like a modern person and has a very human personality.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't imagine his clumsy moves, but he is surprisingly skillful and has a T-shirt design.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He likes grilled sea bream, and konpeito.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He eats konpeito.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But he is cute.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He is cute.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Really.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He is affectionate.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He is used to it.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He is getting close.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Wow! it's quite a fright!

112
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
this is a little frightful

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,120

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
What's that?

123
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,180
He looks so sad.

124
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,180
He had this kind of face?

125
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,180
Wait, wait.

126
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm going to take a picture.

127
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,180
Ah, sorry.

128
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,180
Take a picture. Take a picture.

129
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,180
Ah, amazing. He just laughed.

130
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
He laughed, right?

131
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
He laughed completely.

132
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Ah, scary.

133
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
He's so friendly.

134
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,180
He's so friendly.

135
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
Ah, what's that?

136
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,180
Minju?

137
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Ah, that T-shirt.

138
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
That's the design.

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Ah, I've heard of it.

140
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
You've heard of it?

141
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Did you get it?

142
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
Wait a minute.

143
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,180
Don't cut it.

144
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,180
I'm scared.

145
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
Just a little bit.

146
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,180
Not yet.

147
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
It's a different version.

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
You dug it up.

149
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
I did it.

150
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
It's amazing.

151
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,180
It's not here.

152
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
This is...

153
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,180
That's right.

154
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
It's so beautiful.

155
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
Just the two of us.

156
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
So let's go!

157
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,180
It's moving!

158
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,180
It's moving, right?

159
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
It's moving.

160
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Do you want to go for the moment?

161
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Right now is fine.

162
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Right now is fine.

163
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Here we go!

164
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
It's fine, it's fine.

165
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
Let's go!

166
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Let's go!

167
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
It's moving.

168
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
It is.

169
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
It's going to push.

170
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Yeah, it will push.

171
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Wow.

172
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,180
But this T-shirt is like a photo taken in the past.

173
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
It's a little bit up.

174
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,180
This is the last memory of summer.

175
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
It was amazing.

176
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
You took off the seat belt, right?

177
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
I took off the seat belt.

178
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
So I had a face on the side.

179
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,180
I thought it was a real face.

180
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,180
Be careful when you go out.

181
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
Be careful when you go out.

182
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
Let's be careful.

183
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
Let's take a picture.

184
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Take a picture of the microphone.

185
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Really.

186
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,180
I'm on my way out.

187
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
Ah, here he comes!

188
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
What is it?

189
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
What is this?

190
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,180
I heard something.

191
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Who is it?

192
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Who is it?

193
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
Who is it?

194
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,180
Who is it?

195
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,180
Who is it?

196
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Who is it?

197
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
Tarzan Yamamoto.

198
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,180
Tarzan hates taking a bath.

199
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
He hates it.

200
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Among the celebrities, he is particularly violent.

201
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,180
When he gets excited, he gets up in the middle of the event and makes the staff of the pub get up.

202
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,180
He is the editor of the proletariat.

203
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,180
He appears in erotic magazines.

204
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,180
His subordinate is sleeping with his wife.

205
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,180
The details of this situation have not been revealed yet.

206
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
We have to explain it.

207
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,180
I was told that I was going to be in danger.

208
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,180
I'm a violent person.

209
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,180
I'll take a picture of you.

210
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,180
I'll get off the car and go closer.

211
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,180
I'm not sure if I can do it.

212
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
I don't think I can move.

213
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,180
If you think it's dangerous, don't come.

214
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
Be careful.

215
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,180
If you come, close the door.

216
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
I know.

217
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Shut your mouth!

218
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,720
Hey! stop it!

219
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,820
Are these entanglement OK?

220
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,480
Let's see.

221
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:59,280
They don't like our

222
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,440
Scary!

223
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,780
Scary!

224
00:09:01,780 --> 00:08:50,780
Oh no!

225
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
No!

226
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,780
Oh no, he's here.

227
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
Hey!

228
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
We're in trouble!

229
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
It's a blackout!

230
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,780
It's all automatic!

231
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
It's scary!

232
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
No, no, it's scary!

233
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
It's scary!

234
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,780
You're so angry!

235
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,780
Scary!

236
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
You're so angry!

237
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
It's so scary!

238
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
Scary!

239
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
It's scary!

240
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I'm scared!

241
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
I'm scared!

242
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
No, no, no!

243
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Wow!

244
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
That was amazing!

245
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Let's go!

246
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Let's go!

247
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Hurry!

248
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Hurry!

249
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
I'm scared!

250
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
I'm scared!

251
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
I'm scared!

252
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
That was scary!

253
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
That was a miracle!

254
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
A miracle!

255
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,780
This is scary!

256
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
The moment of the zugi!

257
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
The moment of the zugi! This is terrible!

258
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
A miracle!

259
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
This is terrible!

260
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,780
Let's not call Miyami out of the blue.

261
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Yeah, we shouldn't violate the rules.

262
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
We should call Yoko and cause an accident.

263
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
We'll get in trouble.

264
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
It's like a huge fog!

265
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
This is so cool.

266
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Something is moving.

267
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,780
It's moving.

268
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,780
It's eating rice.

269
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,780
It's eating rice.

270
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
It's slowly getting bigger.

271
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,780
It's eating rice!

272
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
It's eating rice!

273
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,780
He used to be the main character of adult videos.

274
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,780
Nice is too much!

275
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,780
He was a very nice guy.

276
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,780
He was too nice!

277
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Nice! Nice! Nice!

278
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Too nice!

279
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
He said, too nice!

280
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
He said, too nice!

281
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,780
Please wait!

282
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,780
The end is a series of shots!

283
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
Wow!

284
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Just push it down.

285
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
This is how it's done.

286
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
This is how it's done.

287
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,780
It's too nice!

288
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Let's take a picture together.

289
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
I want to take a picture!

290
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Let's go.

291
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,780
The camera is not ready yet.

292
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,780
It hurts!

293
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
It hurts!

294
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
I wanted to get a lot of this!

295
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
Wow!

296
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,780
That was really good!

297
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
That was good!

298
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
That was rare!

299
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
It was the first time!

300
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,780
That was amazing!

301
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
That was really high!

302
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,780
That was really high!

303
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
You're really energetic!

304
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,780
Even though you couldn't break the moth!

305
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,780
You can get that much out of just pushing it!

306
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
It's a very emotional scene.

307
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,780
It's amazing.

308
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,780
It's amazing.

309
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
There's a person in the game.

310
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,780
What's wrong?

311
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
There's something moving over there.

312
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,780
There's something moving.

313
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
What?

314
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,780
What is it?

315
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,780
Something is moving.

316
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,780
What is it?

317
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,780
What you are seeing is not a real unscrupulous criminal.

318
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,780
He is a comedian called Kannazuki who is good at playing the guitar.

319
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:46,780
He is a member of the same group as Kikuo, and he is also good at drawing like Masahiro Chono.

320
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,780
He is also good at drawing different types of guitars that are suitable for different environments.

321
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
I saw the video of him drawing.

322
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:03,780
What kind of guitar do you want me to play?

323
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
There's no such thing.

324
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
There's no such thing.

325
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,780
It's close. It's so close.

326
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,780
It's hard to get close.

327
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
It's close.

328
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,780
It's close.

329
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
It's close.

330
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
It's close.

331
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:29,780
I can hear it.

332
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,780
What is that?

333
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,780
It's you, isn't it?

334
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,780
I saw it earlier.

335
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,780
It's gone.

336
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
That's right.

337
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,780
It's decided.

338
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,780
This is a good photo.

339
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
Wow, amazing!

340
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
The power!

341
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Wow, you could take that!

342
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
This is the real power.

343
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,780
It's fun.

344
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
It was good.

345
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm glad I didn't ignore it.

346
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
I thought it was a trick.

347
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
What's this?

348
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
What is it?

349
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,780
This is a group of mini-games.

350
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,780
They are not bad at all, but they don't know how to attract the attention.

351
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,780
They are trying to get rid of the taste buds.

352
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Snack candy is their favorite.

353
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,780
They are very happy to give it to them.

354
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Snack candy?

355
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
This is okay, right?

356
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Let's go down.

357
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
This is okay.

358
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,780
Let's go down.

359
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
This is cute.

360
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
They are having fun.

361
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
This is cute.

362
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
This is cute.

363
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,780
This is rude.

364
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
All of them are different species.

365
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
This is male, right?

366
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
We are looking for females.

367
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
But there are no females.

368
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Please give it to me. I want to eat it.

370
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
There are sweets.

371
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
There are sweets.

372
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
You ate it.

373
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
You ate it.

374
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
You ate it.

375
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
He ate a lot.

376
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
He was hungry.

377
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Wow, what a great appetite!

378
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,780
I was hungry!

379
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
You didn't cry at all, did you?

380
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
I didn't cry.

381
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
You didn't cry, did you?

382
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,780
Don't fight!

383
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,780
I don't want to eat such a thing.

384
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
I want it directly.

385
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
Directly?

386
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
That's right.

387
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
He fought! He fought!

388
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Don't fight!

389
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780
I don't want to fight!

390
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,780
He looks a little depressed.

391
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
Did he drink water?

392
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,780
I was angry for a moment.

393
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
You were angry?

394
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,780
I was pushed.

395
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
I was pushed and I was like...

396
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,780
I think there are some age differences between senior and junior.

397
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Yes.

398
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Different from the office.

399
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,780
That was tough.

400
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,780
I was angry for a moment.

401
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:37,120
It was like a

402
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I was scared.

403
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I was pushed.

404
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
I was pushed and I was like...

405
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,120
I think there are some age differences between senior and junior.

406
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Yes.

407
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Different from the office.

408
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Now it's tough.

409
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
I don't like it.

410
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
It's like a gender-neutral relationship.

411
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I wonder how to do it.

412
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Stop the car and listen.

413
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
No, no, no.

414
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,620
Yes.

415
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Z!

416
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,620
Huh?

417
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,120
Huh?

418
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,420
Z!

419
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,620
Huh? What do you hear?

420
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,620
I hear something.

421
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Ah! Something came out!

422
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,620
Huh?

423
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,120
Huh?

424
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Ah! It came out!

425
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Z!

426
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Z!

427
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Z!

428
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Z!

429
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Z!

430
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Z!

431
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Z!

432
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Z!

433
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Z!

434
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Z!

435
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Z!

436
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Z!

437
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Z!

438
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Z!

439
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Z!

440
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,120
To hear the voice of the old man, many people from all over the country come to see him.

441
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
It's the first time I've heard it.

442
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
It's the first time I've heard it.

443
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,120
What kind of voice is that?

444
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,120
It's a voice that's not very common.

445
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm looking for something.

446
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I'm looking for something.

447
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
It's the voice of an old man.

448
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Z...

449
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
You can't say Z?

450
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
No, it's inside.

451
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
It's inside.

452
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
What is it?

453
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Is it pointing at something?

454
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
It's looking straight ahead.

455
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
What is it?

456
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Z!

457
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
You cried a lot!

458
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
You cried a lot!

459
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
You cried so much!

460
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
So much!

461
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,120
It's a rare cry.

462
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
There was a pattern like that.

463
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
What is this?

464
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I was surprised.

465
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
What is this?

466
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Yoshizumiya.

467
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Is it real?

468
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I forgot the name again.

469
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,120
The person you are watching is not the real Yoshizumi Ishihara.

470
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,120
This is a celebrity named Kanazuki who is good at acting.

471
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,120
This is one of the two characters that Yoshizumi Ishihara plays.

472
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
I think that's enough.

473
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
The name of the actor is in the news.

474
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
You speak clearly.

475
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
I speak clearly.

476
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
I'll come to your live show.

477
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
You should go.

478
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Wow, amazing.

479
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Wow, amazing.

480
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Excuse me.

481
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Thank you.

482
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Did you see your father?

483
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I saw my father.

484
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I saw him.

485
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
He speaks clearly.

486
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
That's a good picture.

487
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Your father lives here, right?

488
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
That's right.

489
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
It's a bit surprising.

490
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,120
That's right.

491
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
That's what happened.

492
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Oh, there she is.

493
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
What?

494
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
She's a tsugai.

495
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Tsugai, tsugai.

496
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
The wife of Ayako Zana is a Japanese female professional.

497
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Her husband is a doctor.

498
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Really?

499
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
In the Japanese family, the wife has overwhelming power.

500
00:20:10,120 --> 00:19:50,720
Her husband is absolutely

501
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
She's a tsugai.

502
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,120
The mother-in-law is losing her posture of absolute obedience.

503
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
The wife is pregnant.

504
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,120
She is worried about the labor.

505
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,120
But she can see a cute baby at the end of the year.

506
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
At this time of the year,

507
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
I don't want to get close to her.

508
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I'm scared.

509
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
I don't want to be a violent fighter.

510
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
What are you talking about?

511
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Dangerous! Dangerous!

512
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Dangerous! Dangerous!

513
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
What are you doing?

514
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Dangerous! Dangerous!

515
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Are you okay? Are you okay?

516
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Don't say such things.

517
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
You can show it.

518
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,120
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

519
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,120
We can't move like that.

520
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

521
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
It's finally done.

522
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
It's really...

523
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Did you take a picture?

524
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Yes, I did.

525
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Then, from here...

526
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Let's take a picture.

527
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Oh, he's kissing her!

528
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Ah!

529
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

530
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
He was really close.

531
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
When he was kissed.

532
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Ahahaha!

533
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
That's amazing.

534
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
It's so easy.

535
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Okay, good.

536
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
That's good.

537
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Thank you.

538
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
I saw it.

539
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
How many times did you fall here?

540
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
It's amazing.

541
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh, he's kissing her.

542
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Amazing!

543
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Amazing!

544
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
There's a lot of people here.

545
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
There's a lot of people here.

546
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,120
But the people from Tatsuki are really popular.

547
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
That's right.

548
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,120
It's different from the ones you see in the studio.

549
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
It's more of a neighborhood feeling.

550
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Wow!

551
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Gida Yu.

552
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,120
He usually lives in a herd called Takeshigundan.

553
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,120
He likes to eat hot oden and spicy cream puffs.

554
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
That's not true.

555
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,120
He is a very violent person, and he is often attacked by the people around him.

556
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
He is a very violent person, and he is often attacked by the people around him.

557
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Really?

558
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Let's be careful.

559
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,120
Let's go to the side.

560
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Gida-yu, you're wearing short hair for summer.

561
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
From there, from there.

562
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
He's eating something.

563
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
You!

564
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Flash!

565
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Gida-yu, too.

566
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Gida-yu, you're so rough.

567
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
You should go.

568
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Yes, it is, yes, let it goっ

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,800
Wow, that Viblerini might stop

570
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:10,860
I have no temporary

571
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,860
I go, I go

572
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,160
This time I'm going

573
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,360
It's scary, scary, scary

574
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,360
I can not, I can not, I am doing well

575
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Wow!

576
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
It's crazy!

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,360

This is scary!

581
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
This is scary!

582
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
This is scary!

583
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
This is scary!

584
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
When I saw this at Shimbashi in Nagano, I thought it was cold.

585
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
