1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
"Are their hearts connected?" No Smartphone Meetup!

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:15,570
The Rule: They head to a location using the hint card given to them
The challenge doesn't end until they all meet up

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,770
The first hint; A place with a lot of pigeons

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,730
However, they ended up seperated

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,670
The second hint; A theater

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,730
It's gotta be Honda Theater

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,080
Hamada headed to Honda Theater ...

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,560
... and had a splendid reunion with Endo!

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,030
Tonight, let's see if they can all meet up!

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,300
Subbed by senor_wristband

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Currently, Endo & Hamada are in Shimokitazawa
Hosei's in Shinjiku

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,380
And Tanaka is in Shibuya

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,720
Matsumoto is a little farther away in Ginza
Time for the next hint!

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,670
Here we go. This is the next theme,

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,360
A large shoe store?

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,530
A large shoe store?

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,330
Eh? Are there really large shoe stores?

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,330
Oh, like Shoe Distribution Centre?

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,530
I've never bought shoes at a shoe store ...

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,610
Where else would you buy them?!

21
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,580
I have a feeling that place would be good,

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,920
Wasn't there one near that intersection in Sancha? It might be gone now

23
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,620
Matsumoto-san heads to a shoe store near Sanjengaya

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,060
I think it's a pretty big shoe store, considering it's in the city,

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,330
Hamada-san, you have some idea?

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,730
I don't know the name of it though

27
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,570
A shoe store you can't name?

28
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,270
In Sancha, near that police station and the McDonald's,

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,270
Isn't there one there? Like you always see it

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,800
I don't know the name though

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,070
At the intersection?

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,820
Yes yes yes yes
Like a huge one

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,990
I'm totally fine with that

34
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,670
Then let's head there

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,000
They both head to a shoe store in Sanjengaya, like Matsumoto

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,910
I think there are other big shoe stores in the city, but I don't know any of them

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,030
Like for example, is there a Nike Shop?

38
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,050
But that's not just a shoe store though

39
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, right

40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,370
In Harajuku,

41
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,230
The Nike store

42
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,240
Nike store?

43
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,730
It's pretty big, that "Nike Shop" I think it's called

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,600
Hamada-san, and Endo, they wear Nike shoes often don't they?

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,090
They do... they do

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,210
Right?

47
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,060
In fact today, Hamada-san was wearing some Leopard print Nike shoes

48
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,710
Oh yeah

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,690
Since those two Nike shoe wearers are together,

50
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,030
it's totally possible they might go "Let's head to that Nike store"

51
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,600
It's possible. In fact, I can't think of anywhere else.

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,540
What about ABC Mart?

53
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,870
Oh yeah, ABC Mart is an option

54
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,460
There's also the Shoe Distribution Centre
I think it's near Ikejeri Ohashi

55
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,660
Let's head to [!@!@$!@]

56
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,340
Alright

57
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,310
Hamada, Endo, and Matsumoto have a chance of meeting

58
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,790
Hamada & Endo are the first to arrive

59
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,000
Look, that there,

60
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,010
Oh, HERE?

61
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,060
This is a big one!

62
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,330
What is it called?

63
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,170
Oh Chiyoda, that's right

64
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,890
It even says "Shoes" so clearly

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,060
See, there's so many

66
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,910
It's very big

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,220
If you look at it from here you can see,

68
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,630
Woah, it's huge!

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,320
This is a big store, so huge!

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,230
Last time, for the Tsutaya thing, Tanaka definitely walked past here

71
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,240
Yes, he did see it

72
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,360
You know, I want Tanaka to come here

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,380
Yes I want him to come

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,090
I really do think Hamada-san & Endo will come here

75
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,780
Both groups were thinking of each other,

76
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,710
Tanaka chose the Harajuku Nike Shop

77
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,600
There's a lot of people

78
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,770
I think Hamada-san & Endo will for sure come here

79
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,060
Matsumoto reaches Sanjengaya, where Hamada's group is

80
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,740
That's also pretty big shoe store huh?

81
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,400
That one is really big!

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,570
That sign is really big

83
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,580
Hamada and Endo's location

84
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,530
Well still, that's not the point though right?

85
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,870
It's not the one I thought of. The one I thought of is here.

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,950
See, that one. Right?

87
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,350
Matsumoto is just one station away from Hamada's group

88
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,670
He chose the Shoe Distribution Centre in Ikejeri Ohashi

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,270
It's gotta be here. Look, it's so big

90
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,700
Alright, c'mon come here

91
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,200
Any time now

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,080
Alright come on

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,580
However, time's up!

94
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,750
Tanaka-kun, where are you?

95
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,900
I, Tanaka, am at Harajuku-

96
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,900
Harajuku?

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,500
Yes, the Harajuku Nike Shop

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,600
Nike Shop?

99
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,150
That's not a shoe store

100
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah, Tanaka I think you've got the wrong idea

101
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,950
There's so many, there's 150-

102
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,300
Enough already

103
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,010
Limiting it to Nike is wrong,

104
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,200
They make their own shoes!

105
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,150
That is just so irrelevant

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,050
Who cares if they make their own shoes

107
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,950
Where is Hosei-san?

108
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm in the middle of Centre Gai in Shibuya,

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,600
ABC Mart

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,900
Matsumoto-san where are you?

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,640
Listen ... In Ikejiri Ohashi, Shoe Distribution Centre

112
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,350
No way ... the Centre?!

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,950
I should've gone there!

114
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,400
It's the only answer

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,880
I should've gone there

116
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,400
Well, we're close, not that far away I mean

117
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,430
Wait wait hold on hold on

118
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,880
Wait, Hamada & Endo, you two,

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,720
You guys need to react to my "Shoe Distribution Centre" a bit more

120
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,160
Don't just move on, like"Anyways, we're at..."

121
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
Just the flavour, taste it for a second

122
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,760
Very sorry, I didn't taste it

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,530
Matsumoto-san you're not that far from us. You're pretty close

124
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,960
Where?

125
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,140
We're at Sangenjaya's ...

126
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,690
Chiyoda

127
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,690
It's called Chiyoda

128
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,370
That place with the "Shoes" sign...

129
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,280
When I was taking a U-Turn there, I said "Woah, that place is pretty big!"

130
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,800
Ah, is that so?

131
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,800
Oh, you did a U-Turn here?

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
So close

133
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,320
But I never thought of that place though
I just said that when I saw it

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,580
Ah I see, I see I see

135
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,290
I didn't think of that place

136
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,560
Tanaka you should've known this place!

137
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,100
I really really wanna smack Tanaka

138
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,900
I want to slap his glasses off
Even if he isn't wearing them

139
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,760
He doesn't wear glasses

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,770
This is the only place I could think of

141
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,940
The next one please everyone, let's finish this

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,670
This time, they're all close by, which should help their chances
Time for the 4th hint

143
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,300
The next hint,

144
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,170
We should get this one at least

145
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,700
Let's meet everyone

146
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,130
Oooh? A "Gyoza no Osho" location?

147
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,200
But Shozo, this one,

148
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,630
If we consider what everyone might think, there's just that one answer

149
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,800
Isn't this one really hard?

150
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,800
How many branches are there in the city?

151
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,500
There are 66 stores within the city,

152
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,250
However, there's only 4 stores within reach of the members

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,730
Furthermore...

154
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,320
Last time, wasn't there that place Matsumoto-san said "Let's eat here!" ?

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
There was. That happened.

156
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,880
There was right?

157
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
It's just there (Shimokitazawa)

158
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,930
This is something that happened on a shoot in Shimokitazawa 3 years ago

159
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,300
Hmm, where was that Gyoza place again?

160
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,560
Let's eat Gyoza

161
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,970
Gyoza ...

162
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,440
They went to this Gyoza no Osho in the middle of the shoot

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,530
I think this one is not bad,

164
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,450
If we're all thinking the same way,

165
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,600
That's the only answer

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
And, it's near Matsumoto-san right?

167
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,700
Yeah it is. He'll already be there

168
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,150
It is close by

169
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,550
There's only one answer to this question,

170
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,900
This is it. This one is definitely it. Let's go

171
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,650
"That one!" - That's what I think, "That one!"

172
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,350
As for any other answers ... I don't know

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,750
There's one in Dogenzaka as well

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
Dunno!

175
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,250
The three groups have a desired location in mind,

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,160
Just the hesitant Matsumoto is left

177
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,400
Incidentally, there's one there right?

178
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,430
There is, there is. But, I don't think that's the one

179
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,000
It's gotta be [!)(@!&$] hasn't it?

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,900
I think at least one person is bound to go there, right?

181
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,620
Alright, let's go

182
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,000
What "Gyoza no Osho" did he choose?

183
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,440
Tanaka is in Harajuku, which isn't that far

184
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,490
Endo and Hamada aren't that far, they're just behind me

185
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,980
Wait, I think this is the end here

186
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,200
You know,

187
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,710
It's amazing, after 30 years of this,

188
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,990
This "bond" that brings everyone together, we start to understand it

189
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,660
I think there's no doubt we're right

190
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,430
Yeah

191
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,310
Tanaka is the only trouble maker

192
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,200
That's true.  Tanaka ...

193
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,630
After making it this far, I can say Tanaka is the biggest trouble maker

194
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,060
They're at Ikijeri, Sancha, Shibuya ...

195
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,690
So distance wise this is perfect

196
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,340
I wanna meet them

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,570
I hate being the last one left

198
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,510
Will they all be able to meet at Shimokitazawa?

199
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,060
Hamada & Endo reach their destination,

200
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,510
They should already be there

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,710
I think so

202
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,540
Considering the distance, Matsumoto should have arrived earlier

203
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,340
Just where though?

204
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,890
There's no sense that they're here already

205
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,030
Look, look, look - Eh?

206
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,840
You're joking?

207
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,230
Ah! What if Matsumoto-san got hungry and went inside for Gyoza?

208
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,000
It doesn't seem that way

209
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,770
He's not here...

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,490
He isn't here

211
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,490
There's no way ... No way

212
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,200
No way, is this possible?

213
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,430
This is not good, this isn't good

214
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,340
Where did Matsumoto go?

215
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm hungry~ Maybe I'll eat Gyoza while I wait

216
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,110
Next, Hosei arrives at his destination

217
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,030
You know, I almost want to run to everyone-

218
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,740
Let's run then?

219
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,540
Oh, shall we? Let us leap into our comrades' chest!

220
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,770
Are you very confident?

221
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm just pumping with confidence!

222
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,370
Eh? Is there? Huh?

223
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,140
Somebody! Huh? They're gathered over there!

224
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,510
They've gathered!!

225
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,060
Yama-chan's here!

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,540
Exactly! Exactly!

227
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm so glad!

228
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,460
It's gotta be here right?

229
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
This is the only answer!

230
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,830
This place is closest to Matsumoto-san

231
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,230
Yeah, we thought he'd be here before us

232
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,540
He's not here though

233
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,660
I have a memory here with Matsumoto-san too

234
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,790
You've been before right?

235
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,830
Manager Fujiwara, before he got married,

236
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,260
Him and his wife, they had all these dishes laid out, laughing and eating

237
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,660
And Matsumoto-san and I happened to be there too

238
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,740
Oh, coincidentally?

239
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,340
Coincidentally

240
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,310
We've got that memory here

241
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,430
What a cheap performance!

242
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,430
Cheap ...

243
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,370
But it was amazing though, all that food

244
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,940
Even though it's for 2 people

245
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,660
How could they finish that?

246
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,320
Enough food for 4 people

247
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,660
But this was an easy question though

248
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,490
Eh? We need Matsumoto-san at least to meet us here

249
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,660
Oh, we're so close by

250
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,000
Momentarily, Matsumoto will arrive to his destination,

251
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,170
Alright

252
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,770
I don't know if everyone's here,

253
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,710
But it'll be a great ending if they are

254
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,310
Was Matsumoto heading towards Shimokitazawa?

255
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,490
Then Tanaka also arrives,

256
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,490
I think considering everyone's locations, this is the best choice,

257
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,540
I really want to meet them, for real

258
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,970
They're there!

259
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,770
See, they're there!

260
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,170
I did it!

261
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,340
I told you right? It's gotta be Shimokitazawa

262
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,510
Yeah, if Tanaka didn't come here I would've punched him

263
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,030
Yeah, really,

264
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,030
It's gotta be here right?

265
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,740
Its gotta be here

266
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,170
If you got this wrong I was gonna hit you

267
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,630
There's no doubt

268
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,690
It's hard to think of anywhere else really

269
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,400
And we ate here recently

270
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,560
We came here on a Gaki shoot

271
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,580
Yes

272
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,200
But, Matsumoto-san was the closest, and he's still not here,

273
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,030
In Ikejiri?

274
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,110
It's gotta be here! This is it!

275
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,770
Eh really?

276
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,340
Like, you can't think of anywhere else!

277
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,950
Where did Matsumoto end up?

278
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,710
Matsumoto headed to...

279
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,710
I think Yamasaki is walking to here

280
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,370
Gyoza no Osho - Dogenzaka location

281
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,940
Damn I wanna eat that!

282
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,090
I straight up want Gyoza

283
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,710
No, come on this is the end

284
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,230
Like,

285
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,080
There's no sense of celebrities approaching

286
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,660
I think it had to be here, considering the flow. There is a flow after all

287
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,110
Time's up here!

288
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,370
Just what is this

289
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,270
Matsumoto-san, where are you right now?

290
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,840
It's obvious, it's gotta be the Dogenzaka store

291
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,340
Dogenzaka?

292
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,400
No, no, no

293
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,540
It's, there's one in Dogenzaka,

294
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,020
What a pain in the ass

295
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,170
Fine, where are you?

296
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,430
Well, all four of us have assembled

297
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,890
There's 4 of us here

298
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
Seriously?

299
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,170
You're kidding right?

300
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,460
Nah for real

301
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,830
For real

302
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,540
We're all here

303
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,780
Do you remember on that shoot, you said "Let's go get Gyoza .. everyone agree?"

304
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Do you remember that?

305
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,290
Where?

306
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,220
In Shimokitazawa

307
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,220
That's not it!

308
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,970
It IS it

309
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,290
It's totally it

310
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,660
Nobody would think of there

311
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,030
This is the only answer

312
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,490
no no no its gotta be dogenzaka

313
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,300
The distance too. I thought Yamasaki was gonna walk here!

314
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,570
But listen, the answer to "a Gyoza no Osho store?" is Shimokitazawa

315
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,600
And Matsumoto-san, we've all eaten here before

316
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,890
Don't care

317
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,800
You don't care?...

318
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,570
I've never really talked to you

319
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,430
What do you mean we've never talked?

320
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,510
Well whatever there's 4 of us here
You're there by yourself

321
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,190
No no no, think of the flow!

322
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,230
We're here BECAUSE we thought of the flow

323
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,070
Tanaka, you should say something, you've gotten the most complaints

324
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,660
You know, I,

325
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,340
I never thought you were such an incapable person

326
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,170
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. I'm just startled

327
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
I'm capable, i'm capable

328
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,290
I am, I am, I'm actually really capable

329
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,510
Forgive me, Senpai

330
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,600
Alright, that's enough, it's time for the next one

331
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,060
God this is annoying

332
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,740
We're counting on you

333
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,170
I'm definitely not in the wrong here, but whatever

334
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,860
The quantity decides!

335
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,830
Going by quantity, this is it

336
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,060
How many times are we gonna have this argument about quantity?

337
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,060
And now Endo's using words he doesn't understand

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,510
I can understand quantity at least

339
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,340
This is the first time Matsumoto's been left by himself

340
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,270
They want to decide this with the next hint

341
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,010
"A place with Tokyo in the name"

342
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,290
This is another hard one!

343
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,420
There's more choices than you'd think

344
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,090
Let's just go with the cliche?

345
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,660
What place is a cliche?

346
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,400
A super cliche place? I think it's the same place

347
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,370
Alright, super cliche

348
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,060
Let's go with super cliche then

349
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,200
Tokyo Station

350
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,200
Tokyo Station

351
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,200
Tokyo Tower

352
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,200
Tokyo Tower

353
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,830
Tower, tower ...

354
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,400
Station, station

355
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,400
Ah we split up!

356
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,910
I'm sorry, you're right. It's Tokyo Tower

357
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,660
Right?

358
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,770
It's the Tower

359
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,690
Right? It stands out

360
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,550
Let's go to the tower then?

361
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, the station is out

362
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
We're alright then?

363
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,370
I think so

364
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,890
And if he doesn't come, we have to think again

365
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,910
Meanwhile, Matsumoto ...

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,090
So difficult!

367
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,860
Let's think while eating Gyoza

368
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,800
What do we do if we don't meet him?

369
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,230
yeah honestly

370
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,970
A troublemaker has been discovered

371
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,970
He certainly has!

372
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,770
If his choice turns out to be dumb

373
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,060
He's changed positions with you

374
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,260
It's been passed down to the next generation

375
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,170
It's gone backwards actually

376
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,540
What did Matsumoto think of while eating Gyoza?

377
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,630
Hold on, Tokyo Station?

378
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,540
Or hold on, Tokyo Tower?

379
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,090
Whatever! Let's go to [@!$!@@$!]

380
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,740
Shall we?

381
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,740
Let's go and see

382
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,570
Did Matsumoto pick Tokyo Station? Or Tokyo Tower?

383
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,450
The 4 head at Tokyo Tower

384
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,000
I guess only Tanaka would understand how Matsumoto feels right now

385
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It feels very tragic,

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,540
Like, have I really been left behind by society?

387
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,540
I guess you would right

388
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,130
You'd think "Do I have bad taste?"

389
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,290
This is the first time I've been by myself this long

390
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,660
That's true. It's also very rare.

391
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,430
Those guys are just deviants, there's nothing I can do

392
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,910
It's so frightening being a deviant

393
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,460
He's probably by himself right now, and we'll see this on TV

394
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,710
He's just complaining the whoooole time

395
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,830
Yeah, he probably his

396
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,200
Yeah

397
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
Like, complaing the whoooole time

398
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,230
I guess it makes sense,

399
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,910
Making a TV show with morons like them is really tiring

400
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,430
I guess they just have bad intuition. They have no "sense"

401
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,370
I just think, it's really tiring making a show with idiots like that'

402
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,710
Oh yeah, I just remembered

403
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,320
You said that picture of bird shit looked like me

404
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,940
What happened?

405
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,540
Oh yeah, when the "Photos Resembling Hamada" episode aired

406
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,800
I didn't,

407
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,830
I didn't know anything about that

408
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,660
You said "This is Hamada isn't it?"

409
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,230
Everyone found it funny, so I let it go

410
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,710
It was pretty funny after all

411
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,710
Pulling out that picture ...

412
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,090
It was um, it was a mirror image

413
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,260
The 4 reach Tokyo Tower

414
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,540
Considering the distance, Matsumoto would have arrived first

415
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,690
If he isn't here already, that's not right is it?

416
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,480
Eh? No way, he isn't here?

417
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,570
You're joking

418
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,060
If he isn't here already, that's not right is it?

419
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,190
Eh? No way, he isn't here?

420
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,230
He's there!

421
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,230
Oh he's there, thank goodness!

422
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,110
You were alone the whole time!

423
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,800
The whole time!

424
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,030
Piegeons live in Ueno, it's a fact. In Ueno Park

425
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,490
Pigeons!

426
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,830
It should have ended with Gyoza

427
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,310
Yeah with Gyoza

428
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,110
Yes, Shimokitazawa should have been the end

429
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,770
no no no no. No.

430
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,940
No no no

431
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,860
But you felt that regret right?

432
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,110
"AH! Shimokitazawa!"

433
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,630
I was talking with the staff

434
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,710
When you make a show with people who have no "sense", this is how it turns out

435
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,000
Thank god though!

436
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,570
Yes, thank god we met here!

437
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,690
If we couldn't get this one, what could we get?

438
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,890
Even if it was like "Where is Yoshimoto's Headquarters"
