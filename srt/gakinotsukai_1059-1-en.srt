10
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,040
We had an amazing battle...

11
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,850
Let's review our scores

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,550

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,550

Yamasaki

24
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,040
What the hell's wrong with my score...?

25
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,480
That looks right

26
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,580
Your score was a "turd"

27
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,820
That's not right!

28
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,480
It means you scored below zero

29
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,540
Cocorico

30
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,540

Shozo Endo

32
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,490
Unprecedented

33
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,420
That's a terrible feat

34
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,710
You scored a turd on television

35
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,320
But that's old news!

36
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,840
Hosei Yamasaki

37
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,430
Now we're back with an even better challenge!

38
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,580
TODAY WE'RE COOKING OUR OWN BIBIMBAP!!!!!!

39
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,080
Each member will make their own Bibimbap
and the others will give it a score

40
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,850
Why so loud?

41
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,960
Why all of a sudden?

42
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,750
Something's wrong with your volume

43
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,110
You spat right in my eye

44
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,160
Downtown Presents:
Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende!!

45
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,860
Absolutely Tasty - Bibimbap Challenge

46
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,860
Naoki Tanaka's Turn

47
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,860
Tanaka will be the first to face the Bibimbap Challenge!!

48
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,520
Time for my two dishes

49
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,520
And here's my first dish!!

50
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,510
Here it is

51
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,040
Ingredients

52
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,040
Seasoned Dried Seaweed + Seaweed Tea

53
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,040
I have Miyako Konbu (seasoned dried seaweed)

54
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
and seaweed tea

55
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,510
These are readily available at any convenience store

56
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,600
But they have a dramatic effect on Bibimbap!!

57
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
Basically, it's all seaweed...

58
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
but in a variety of different forms...

59
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,280
Tanaka starts cooking

60
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:33,590
Base
Ingredients

61
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:33,590
Rice, Namul + Egg

62
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,660
by adding *Namul and egg over rice inside a heated stone pot

63
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,100
*Namul = general term for a vegetable dish with Korean seasonings

64
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,510
I could eat it the way it is right now...

65
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,610
You're not holding back

66
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,850
I'm not gonna waste any

67
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,460
Your arm makes me lose my appetite

68
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,020
Are you clean?

69
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,250
Of course, I washed my hands

70
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,620
But you meant my hairy arm?

71
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,200
And then!

72
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm adding the seaweed tea powder

73
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,920
You're going for it!

74
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,490
And that's it!!

75
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,570
It's ready!!

76
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Bake for 10 minutes

77
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,420
Serious?

78
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,530
Now we bake it

79
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,570
Right, now we just wait for it to cook

80
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,980
Tanaka's second dish is

81
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,210
Here it is!!

82
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:05,130
Corn Flakes + Salad + Banana + Yogurt

83
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:05,130
Ingredients

84
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,650
No good

85
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,400
Please, hear me out

86
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,980
Too risky...

87
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,720
It's Corn Flakes, salad, banana, and yogurt

88
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,180
Like breakfast...

89
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,180
Right!!

90
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,040
It'll be a hit among office workers

91
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,170
But bananas...

92
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,920
Who would cook with a stone pot in the morning?!

93
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,740
Right!

94
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,870
Precisely!

95
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,180
That's precisely why!

96
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,840
No sane person would drag out a stone pot in the morning!

97
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,270
Why not eat the ingredients separately?

98
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,140
Why not eat them as they are?!

99
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,420
Like a normal person

100
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,390
Seriously though, we don't know how good this will turn out

101
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,990
Base
Ingredients

102
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,990
Rice, Namul + No egg

103
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,590
I have high expectations for this dish

104
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,970
Here's the sliced bananas!!

105
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,680
I don't want hot, burned bananas...

106
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,650
I'll call this, "Start the Morning Right Bibimbap"

107
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,400
I would turn violent if I caught my wife fixing this in the morning

108
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,700
I'd be like, "In the morning? WTF?"

109
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,100
Cook for 10 minutes

110
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,070
Please, save your judgment for later

111
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,050
Here's Tanaka's first dish, Konbu Bibimbap

112
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,050
Konbu Bibimbap

113
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,050
Tanaka's Idea

114
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,830
It doesn't look too bad

115
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,740
Not bad at all

116
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,610
And it smells pretty good

117
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,430
How's it gonna taste?

118
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,610
Very promising

119
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,750
Itadakimasu!

120
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,370
I don't mind digging right into this dish...

121
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,500
Delicious!!

122
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,980
This is really good!

123
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,310
I agree

124
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,230
The seasoned dried seaweed adds a nice flavor

125
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,750
This is delicious

126
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,370
This is delicious

127
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,450
What's that?

128
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,040
Just in case

129
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,480
you wanted to enjoy *Ochazuke

130
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,150
Ochazuke = rice with seasonings in hot water or tea

131
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
you can add some hot water

132
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
and enjoy the dish that way

133
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,260
How about it, Hamada-san?

134
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,340
What?

135
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,100
How about some tea?

136
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,310
Hot water

137
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,510
Hot water?

138
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,900
You get to enjoy the tea flavor if you add water

139
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,620
Nobody else?

140
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,070
Because none of us are into hot water like you are

141
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,450
I'm serious, he loves hot water

142
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,680
Is that so?

143
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
I had no idea

144
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,310
You really like hot water?

145
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,740
I'd say it's better without it

146
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,900
It was better witout the hot water?

147
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,640
It's not as good as real Ochazuke?

148
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,420
Why not try it then...

149
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,560
I have to also point out

150
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
that the flavor gets a little too spicy

151
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,800
Yes, it gets too overpowering

152
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,110
I agree

153
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,020
So maybe it's better to add hot water to take the edge off

154
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,780
I could get into this

155
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,510
Hot Pepper Paste

156
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,160
This is so good

157
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,050
Really?

158
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,610
Why the hell are you acting like a food snob?

159
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,730
This paste makes all the difference

160
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,500
Now YOU are the No.1 hot water fan

161
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,390
Tanaka, you did good with this

162
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,720
This is very good

163
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,930
How would you score this?

164
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,860
I give it 6 points

165
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,860
Agreed!

166
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,860
Agreed!

167
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,860
OK then

168
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,820
Wait a sec, please

169
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,230
Everyone agreed this was a delicious dish

170
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,010
6 points is harsh

171
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,470
How about 8 points?

172
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,900
You scored 6 points

173
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,640
That's it

174
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,950
It's final

175
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,110
Matsumoto Computer Calculates 6 Points

176
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,800
Matsumoto Computer Calculates 6 Points

177
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,790
Konbu Bibimbap

178
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,790
Despite the high praise, it only received 6 points

179
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,830
Banana

180
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,830
Breakfast Bibimbap

181
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,830
Corn Flakes

182
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,830
Salad

183
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,830
Tanaka's Idea

184
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,830
Yogurt

185
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,720
His second idea is geared towards women

186
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,830
How is it?

187
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,830
I can smell it

188
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,570
I can smell the cooked banana

189
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,000
I can definitely smell banana

190
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,050
Right

191
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,810
Why don't I mash this up a little?

192
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,610
It stinks

193
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,640
Stinky

194
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,070
Serious stench

195
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,430
Please wait until you've tried it

196
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,010
Man, I don't even want to try it

197
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,010
I can tell by its foul stench

198
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,110
Yes, it really does stink

199
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,460
This could attract some serious city flies

200
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,330
This is...

201
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,000
Seriously, no flies could miss this stench

202
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,630
Do I eat the bananas?

203
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,680
Please, go ahead and try it

204
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,640
Banana is the main ingredient

205
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,160
No doubt this is full of healthy ingredients

206
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,050
I don't deserve this...

207
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,330
Why am I being punished?

208
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,870
Seriously, this has the worst texture

209
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,180
The worst texture

210
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,860
What the hell is this?

211
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,550
There's nothing good about this

212
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,890
This is bad

213
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,960
How should we score it?

214
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
Here's what he scored!!

215
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,620
I give it 6 points

216
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,210
It's broken!

217
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,860
That's way too high!

218
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,510
The computer is broken

219
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,900
That's too high

220
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
I'm kidding, of course

221
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,770
I'm just messing around

222
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,790
Breakfast Bibimbap

223
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,770
His risky choice backfires and he gets one point

224
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,780
Absolutely Tasty - Bibimbap Challenge

225
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,780
Masatoshi Hamada's Attempt

226
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,760
Hamada, whose scores were awful last time, is up next

227
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,990
You'll like the looks of this

228
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,170
You mean the ingredients?

229
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,200
Here they are!

230
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:26,460
Ingredients

231
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:26,460
Monjyayaki batter + Pollack Roe + Crispy Noodles

232
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:26,460
*Monjyayaki = type of Japanese pan-fried batter with various ingredients

233
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,770
What?!
This is almost cheating!

234
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,350
How come?

235
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,000
How can this not be good?!!

236
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Didn't I say you'd like the looks of this?

237
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,050
You're just throwing the batter in there?

238
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,030
Why not?

239
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,810
Really?

240
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,020
I'm curious how it'll turn out

241
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:39,350
Base
Ingredients

242
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:39,350
Rice, Namul + Egg

243
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,840
Here's the crispy noodles

244
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,440
You're not cutting that?

245
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,250
You put the fish eggs over an egg

246
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,940
Once everything cooks, it'll be an amazing dish

247
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,060
And what do we have here?

248
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,130
Here it is!

249
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,320
Ingredient

250
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,320
Soy bean Flour *No sugar

251
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,130
Soy bean flour

252
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,150
Soy bean flour

253
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,550
Soy bean flour?

254
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,990
It's full of nutrients

255
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,980
Athletes can't be fit

256
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,010
by ignoring rich nutrients from beans

257
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,810
That's right, beans are good for you

258
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:17,570
Base
Ingredients

259
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:17,570
Rice, Namul + Egg

260
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
I guess you just pour it in

261
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,430
That's a lot of flour

262
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,240
That's a lot!

263
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,630
Seriously, stop messing around

264
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,990
This is it, this is all

265
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
That's a lot!

266
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,900
Hamada's Idea

267
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,900
Monjyayaki Bibimbap

268
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,880
How does Hamada's Soybean Flour Bibimpbap taste?

269
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,510
You can't go wrong with this

270
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,020
I have a good feeling....

271
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,430
It smells awesome

272
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,700
So good

273
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,350
We all have spatulas

274
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,480
I've got one

275
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,910
I have one too

276
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,460
Eat it with a spatula?

277
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,680
I see, it's like eating Monjyayaki

278
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,060
Why not, right?

279
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,200
Like Monjyayaki

280
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,420
Like this

281
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,470
Give me some fish eggs too

282
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,790
Of course, you get some

283
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,400
Don't be shy...dig in

284
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
Good

285
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,880
That's good

286
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,740
I told you this would be good!

287
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,050
How can it not be good?

288
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,390
This is really good

289
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,750
Better than I imagined

290
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,270
This is so delicious

291
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,160
This turned out good, huh?

292
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,520
Delicious!

293
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,770
It would be even better if was more burned

294
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,060
You're right

295
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,710
It could use more crispiness

296
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,920
This is exceptional

297
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,570
Sometimes I wish I had a bowl of rice when I eat Monjyayaki,

298
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,070
I guess I just have to ask for it

299
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,760
So rice with Monjya?

300
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,590
Rice Monjya

301
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,300
Someone should start that idea

302
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,200
This is good, right?

303
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,580
OK then, if you would

304
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,900
give it a score

305
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,040
How about a high score?

306
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,770
Got it

307
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,910
Let's go around

308
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,450
Yamasaki-san, please?

309
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,340
This is better than the previous one, right?

310
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,280
What's your score?

311
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,430
6 points!!

312
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
What the...?!!

313
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,580
That's pretty fair

314
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,590
Are you sure?

315
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,530
Get outta there!

316
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
We're scoring it right now

317
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,170
I'm so into this dish

318
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,710
I give it 9 points

319
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,890
See?

320
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,400
Why don't you two get a freakin' room?

321
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,660
Why don't you two get a freakin' room?

322
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,450
Endo's been whipped

323
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,320
OK, no personal gossip!

324
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,320
Monjya Bibimbap

325
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,320
A strong score of 7 points compared to the last time!

326
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,770
Hamada's Idea

327
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,770
Soybean Flour Bibimbap

328
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,770
Hamada's second dish is for the health conscious

329
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,350
I'd say you added too much

330
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,980
What are you talking about?

331
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,920
Too much flour

332
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,100
I don't think so

333
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,040
It just needs to be mixed well

334
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,140
It looks like sawdust...

335
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,010
Yeah, it does

336
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,020
Itadakimasu!

337
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,810
So dry...

338
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,930
I wish the flour would go away

339
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,770
The flour blocks the flavors of the other ingredients

340
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,410
A dog would scream in agony if it ate this

341
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,450
with its tail between its legs

342
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,830
This is terrible

343
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,970
Awful

344
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,550
I would say...

345
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,000
This can't be scored

346
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,870
It's not THAT bad

347
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,990
It's just soybean flour

348
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,070
You scored "Pubic Hair"

349
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,490
He's done it

350
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,370
First time

351
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,860
What the hell kind of score is that?

352
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,060
Pretty much the worst

353
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,510
That's the first ever "Pubic Hair"

354
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,000
Soybean Flour Bibimbap

355
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,990
Pubic Hair

356
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,970
Soybean flour bibimbap received the worst - "Pubic Hair"

357
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,990
Absolutely Tasty - Bibimbap Challenge

358
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,990
Shozo Endo's Turn

359
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,990
The third challenger, Endo, has a theme

360
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,830
Here's my summer themed ingredients

361
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,920
Beer + Edamame + Mixed Nuts + Turmeric

362
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,920
Ingredients

363
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,300
We have beer and snacks

364
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,920
As well as turmeric which cures your hangover

365
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:56,840
Base
Ingredients

366
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:56,840
Rice, Namul + Egg

367
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,030
First add mixed nuts with the Edamame beans

368
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,030
And beer?

369
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,590
That's right

370
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,150
I don't need that

371
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,810
Please, listen to that sound!

372
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,160
That's really nothing special

373
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,810
Lastly, this turmeric will prevent a hangover

374
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,540
Would I get pulled over for this?

375
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,500
Don't worry, it evaporates

376
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,140
Right, the alcohol will be gone

377
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,530
Why bother then?

378
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,040
Here's Endo's second dish

379
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,340
Here's some more summer-themed ingredients!

380
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,840
Ingredients

381
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,840
Watermelon + Salt

382
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,690
Now he's done it!

383
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,730
Not good

384
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,760
Watermelon!!

385
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,760
Seriously, I'll pass

386
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
I guarantee this won't work

387
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,120
But if it's successful,

388
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,090
I bet people will try this at home

389
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,490
It can't get simpler than this

390
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,290
Base
Ingredients

391
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,290
Rice only

392
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,030
I'm only using rice as a base ingredient

393
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,950
Nothing else?!

394
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,310
No, just rice

395
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,440
How come?

396
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,620
I'm willing to take a risk

397
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,540
And this will work!

398
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,000
To finish it off,

399
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,780
I'm using some

400
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,680
salt

401
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,330
I don't think that's enough salt

402
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,010
Beer

403
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,010
Beer + Snack Bibimbap

404
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,010
Edamame

405
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,010
Endo's Idea

406
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,010
Mixed Nuts

407
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,010
Turmeric

408
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,990
The cast is ready to try Endo's beer, snacks, and turmeric dish

409
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,780
That's unappealing

410
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,160
Nothing is too burned...

411
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,510
I lost my appetite

412
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,880
Shall we?

413
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,030
Itadakimasu!

414
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,940
This is a seasonal dish with beer...

415
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,790
What the hell am I smelling?

416
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,210
Is that Turmeric?

417
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,000
This isn't so bad after all

418
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,850
No, oddly enough....

419
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,890
Surprisingly

420
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm not a fan

421
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I actually hate this

422
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,260
Endo, how would you score this?

423
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,550
Can I be honest?

424
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,130
Let's be honest

425
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,840
Perhaps, 10 points....

426
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,730
You asked for that

427
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,130
What I meant was perhaps 10 is too high so...

428
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,110
8 points?

429
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,130
How in the hell does this deserve 8 points?!

430
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,050
How about...

431
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,490
5 points??

432
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,490
No way!

433
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,490
No way!

434
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,240
No way!

435
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,430
Absolutely NO!

436
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,090
I can't go any lower...

437
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,520
No way!

438
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,460
Beer + Snack Bibimbap

439
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,460
Not everyone's favorite, it received 2 points

440
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,510
Endo's Idea

441
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,490
Watermelon Bibimbap

442
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,470
Another summer-themed dish, Watermelon Bibimbap

443
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,850
I see some of it is burned

444
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,910
Endo, why don't you go solo on this?

445
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,190
I really don't want this

446
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,150
It's just mush

447
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,690
Damn it...

448
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,440
Watermelon with salt...

449
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,000
I can have seconds

450
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,540
I doubt it...

451
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,630
How is it?

452
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,900
It's not so bad

453
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,010
Thank you!!

454
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,790
No way, I hate this

455
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,480
It isn't that bad, right?

456
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,960
It's better than expected

457
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,300
It's not that awful

458
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,600
It is edible

459
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,610
Right?

460
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,530
I can only smell trash

461
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,030
It has a reasonable sweetness to it

462
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,030
Right, it's sweet and

463
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,720
And it has a good flavor

464
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,100
I agree

465
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,770
Right?

466
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,180
Shouldn't the combination of flavors equal a perfect 10?!

467
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,950
It's a perfect dish

468
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,570
We all have different taste buds

469
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,570
Watermelon Bibimbap

470
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,550
Unfortunately, not everyone liked it, so it received 4 points

471
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,580
Absolutely Tasty - Bibimbap Challenge

472
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,580
Hosei Yamasaki's Attempt

473
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,600
Next up is Yamasaki who scored a perfect 10 last year

474
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,420
Ingredient

475
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,420
Pudding

476
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,280
What do you think?

477
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,400
Please, can we stay away from sweets?

478
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,020
Because I love kids so much,

479
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,500
I wanted to make a dish for kids

480
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,720
I seriously hate anything sweet

481
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,010
Base
Ingredients

482
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,010
Rice only

483
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,010
Sweets have no place in cooking

484
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,800
All I'm doing is dumping the pudding on rice!

485
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
Here it is!

486
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,000
Who cares what it looks like at this point

487
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,590
And that's it!!

488
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,720
What?!

489
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,280
Once it's cooked, I'll have one more thing to add

490
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,890
It's all good

491
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,940
Ingredients

492
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,940
Tapioca + Coconut Milk

493
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,550
Next, Yamasaki chose tapioca, a Chinese dessert

494
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,960
How will he use it?

495
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm replacing rice with tapioca!!

496
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,540
What?

497
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,620
Whoo!!

498
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,480
WTF?

499
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,870
So no rice

500
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,700
I see what you're doing

501
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,940
Think of the tapioca as the rice

502
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,940
So you're thinking tapioca can replace rice

503
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,930
It's a replacement

504
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,960
But you're still putting that in?!

505
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,970
*Namul

506
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,970
Base
Ingredients

507
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,850
*Namul = a general term for a vegetable dish with Korean seasoning

508
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,770
Otherwise, it's not Bibimbap

509
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,830
That's something else

510
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,110
So you're serious

511
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,180
Now you're just messing around

512
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm adding some of this too

513
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,610
Coconut milk?

514
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,870
You're taking lots of chances

515
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,840
And that's it for me!

516
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,840
Pudding Bibimbap

517
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,840
Yamasaki's Idea

518
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Yamasaki targets kids with Pudding Bibimbap

519
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,780
Look, it's like egg over rice

520
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,390
I'll pass

521
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,300
Looks can be deceiving...

522
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,780
Check this out

523
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,370
What's going on?

524
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,780
What the hell are you doing?

525
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,290
He's just playing now

526
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,430
Please, this is serious business

527
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,840
Cut it out, will you?

528
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,100
You wouldn't let your kids get away with this, would you?

529
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,910
I know I would

530
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,820
Watch me closely

531
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,740
I'm not surprised
It can't be that easy to do

532
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,900
See that?

533
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,220
Now what?

534
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,600
Pour caramel

535
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,550
Then on top of the caramel....

536
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,370
Every kid's favorite - whipped cream

537
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,840
Then my own kids' favorite, a cherry on top

538
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,880
Now it's complete!!

539
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,260
I have to say

540
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,930
It looks OK

541
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,920
Right

542
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,960
I give you that

543
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,950
This isn't even Bibimbap anymore

544
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,950
I won't deny that

545
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,140
Prison food is better than this

546
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,430
I don't deserve this

547
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,170
The only thing I can taste is

548
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,410
caramel...

549
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:01,910
Yes

550
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,070
There's zero flavor

551
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,050
On rice?

552
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,980
Right, none

553
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,860
It's tastier than I thought

554
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,830
Hell no!

555
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,620
This is utter garbage

556
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,850
Then how many points?

557
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,540
I would score this as

558
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,420
nothing other than

559
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,030
Ass Hair

560
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,590
The better question is

561
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,110
How many ass hairs does this deserve?

562
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,250
So the more ass hair, the better?

563
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,360
I'd say yes

564
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,830
I'd say Ass Hair is bad enough

565
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,970
4 Ass Hairs

566
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,760
What is this, a card game?

567
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,770
Pudding Bibimbap

568
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,790
A nice looking dish, but it received 4 Ass Hairs

569
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,790
4 Ass Hairs

570
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,800
Tapioca Bibimbap

571
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,800
Yamasaki's Idea

572
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,800
Itadakimasu!!

573
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,050
This dish needs a miracle

574
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,770
What's this?

575
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,050
It's tasteless

576
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,720
This is surprisingly bland

577
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,560
It's kind of like when I'm in the dentist's chair

578
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,980
And I'm like, "Doc, what did you just do?"

579
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,370
"Tell me what you just did"

580
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,380
Like when your mouth is numb?

581
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,370
I'd say sweets doesn't go with this

582
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,210
But I think it's better than Ass Hair

583
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,870
Athlete's Foot

584
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,870
That's the worst

585
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,120
Bibimbap has athlete's foot?

586
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,090
You set me up

587
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,100
Tapioca Bibimbap

588
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,050
A great idea that didn't turn out well receives an Athlete's Foot rating

589
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,070
Athlete's Foot

590
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,150
Absolutely Tasty - Bibimbap Challenge

591
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,150
Hitoshi Matsumoto's Turn

592
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,150
Can Matsumoto beat Hamada's 7 point dish?!

593
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,730
Behold!!

594
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,070
Ingredient

595
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,070
Instant Coffee

596
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,930
Instant coffee

597
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,420
I'm telling you this is so good

598
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,670
So good you guys are already drooling all over

599
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,750
Not at all

600
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,620
I'm flabbergasted

601
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,320
No, no drool over here

602
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,050
Flabbergasted

603
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,940
That's us

604
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,890
Zero drool

605
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,330
I can't believe how much you were all drooling over this

606
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,440
You won't be disappointed

607
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,090
Base
Ingredients

608
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,090
Rice, Namul + One Egg

609
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,340
That's too much

610
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,380
I was just thinking the same thing

611
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,120
And what's in Matsumoto's second dish?

612
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,450
Here it is!!

613
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,090
What?

614
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,830
Can you tell what these are?

615
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,600
What are they?

616
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,990
No?

617
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,090
I can't even smell anything

618
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,250
There's no smell

619
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,680
Here's the answer

620
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,660
I see

621
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
I'm only using

622
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
the toppings from the Cup Noodles

623
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:24,500
Ingredient

624
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:24,500
Meat from Cup Noodles

625
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,860
These have got to work well with Bibimbap!!

626
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,700
Talk about a flavor explosion!!

627
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,830
Well, it is meat after all

628
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,710
Of course

629
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,970
This is a great idea, isn't it?

630
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,890
It's a great idea to only use the meat

631
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,670
Base
Ingredients

632
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,670
Rice, Namul + No Egg

633
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,250
That's an impressive amount

634
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,090
All of it?

635
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,010
Why not use it all?

636
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,770
That seems like a lot

637
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,020
Lastly, he adds hot water to tenderize the meat

638
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,810
Seriously, what's with all of your drooling?

639
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,270
Are you....?

640
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,650
Endo, you're crying?!

641
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,050
There's no way I'd cry over this

642
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,010
OK then

643
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,670
It's game time!

644
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,800
Instant Coffee Bibimbap

645
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,800
Matsumoto's Idea

646
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,800
Matsumoto goes for a mature flavor with his Instant Coffee Bibimbap

647
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,660
Open

648
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,480
Amazing

649
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,790
Stinks!!

650
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,320
Stinky!!

651
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,480
That stinks!!

652
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,610
Stinks!

653
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,820
This is terrible!

654
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
It doesn't smell that bad!!

655
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,490
It's not coming our way

656
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,230
Come over here!

657
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,980
You've gotta check this out

658
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,340
It's a serious stench

659
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,000
It isn't that bad!

660
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,980
Hamada-san, please

661
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,190
That stinks!!

662
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,930
It smells awful over here

663
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,540
You're right!!

664
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,790
Well, there's a hint of...

665
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,890
It smells like sea snails

666
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,340
It smells like the tip of a sea snail to be more precise

667
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,220
It does stink pretty bad

668
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,880
But how did this happen?

669
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,180
"How did this happen?"

670
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,660
It doesn't smell like coffee either

671
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,220
That smell is overpowering

672
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,410
We eat it as is?

673
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,940
Go ahead and try it

674
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,150
Eat it as is

675
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,560
Well then...

676
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,180
Thank you all for your hard work

677
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,590
Do you do that at home too?

678
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,330
Here we go

679
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,350
Why did I say that anyhow?

680
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,210
I couldn't come up with anything better

681
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,230
I know I was put on the spot but

682
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,220
Itadakimasu!

683
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,130
That's bitter

684
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,760
This is so bitter

685
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,120
That is bitter

686
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,150
It's burned too

687
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,060
Bitter

688
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,910
So bitter

689
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,250
Just awful

690
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,680
Way too bitter

691
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,420
Of course, this is bitter

692
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,420
So I'm adding this to the dish

693
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,100
Adding Cream

694
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Help yourselves to some

695
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,080
Guaranteed awesomeness

696
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,590
C'mon, this is impossible

697
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,890
This isn't right

698
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,190
Nonsense

699
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,490
This deserves the lowest score ever

700
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,170
I honestly hate this thing

701
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,130
It's the worst ever dish in the history of this show

702
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,300
But I predict

703
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,530
the instant coffee in your kitchens will disappear little by little after this

704
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,550
My score is

705
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,840
D#$% Cheese!

706
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,870
Instant Coffee Bibimbap

707
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,870
D!@# Cheese

708
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,840
Instant Coffee Bibimbap got the worst score ever - D!@# Cheese

709
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,870
Cup Noodles Bibimbap

710
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,870
Matsumoto's Idea

711
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,870
He's shooting for the best score with his Cup Noodle Bibimbap dish

712
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,980
Open

713
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,630
Looks delicious!!

714
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,120
Can I say...

715
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,760
this could replace a birthday cake?

716
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,600
No, I'd still want something better than this

717
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,190
Check it out!

718
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,090
You're probably already feeling defeated

719
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,420
I need to try it first

720
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,080
I'll hold my judgement

721
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,540
until we try it

722
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,470
Well then...

723
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Itadakimasu!

724
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,380
Itadakimasu!

725
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
Delicious

726
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,990
Good

727
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,940
The meat tenderized very well

728
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,270
Am I right?

729
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,050
Tasty

730
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,130
The meat turned out great

731
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,140
This is really good

732
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,320
Good, good, good

733
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,460
Delicious

734
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,390
They don't mess around with these

735
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,390
What's the score?

736
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,660
I would give it 5 points

737
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,540
I would give it 5 points

738
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,520
I feel you

739
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,030
Seriously...

740
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
5 points it is

741
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,050
No way

742
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,340
No way, no, no, no

743
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,900
Tanaka?

744
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
4 points!

745
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,040
It's gone down!

746
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,300
Hamada-san!?

747
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,560
2 points

748
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,800
I give it a Pubic Hair

749
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,490
I freakin' quit!

750
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,000
This dish is so awesome!

751
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,460
