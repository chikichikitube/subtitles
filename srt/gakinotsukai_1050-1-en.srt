2nd Gaki- no-tsukai-ya -arahende!!
Duo Competition! Comedian Quiz Grand Prix!

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,150
The comedians who will be participating are here!

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,490
- Let's do this!
- I won't lose!

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,420
Now, let's welcome today's special guest!

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,230
Downtown!

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,940
Hi.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,870
How are you feeling today?

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,980
- I just talked with Hamada for about 4 hours in the dressing room.
- 4 hours!?

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,110
We just want to enjoy this.

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:56,490
And not just aiming to win, but hoping that the duos can have fun, be close, and stay healthy.

11
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,690
Stay healthy?
Yes, that's important.

12
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,570
Today, you will compete in a quiz using this panel.

13
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,240
Each duo will take turns choosing a panel and answering a quiz.

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,850
For example, if Cocorico chooses "Riddle's 10," only Cocorico will have the right to answer the question.

15
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,650
- Do we have to stay quiet?
- Yes!

16
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,920
The duo with the most points will win a trip to Hawaii!

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,490
Hell yeah!!

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,820
Enjoy this trip for five days and three nights!

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,560
Let's get started!

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:44,700
[subbed by RAIDEN1017]

21
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,780
Let's get started!
First, Downtown, please choose a question!

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,680
Yoshimoto's 30!

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,150
Okay, Yoshimoto's 30!

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,790
Q. What did Kanpei Hazama achieve over the course of about two years?

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,430
- They get 30 points for such an easy question?
- Is this a question for just us?

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,160
Only Downtown has the right to answer this.

27
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,370
Earth Marathon.

28
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,370
Yeah!!

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,140
We could end it now.

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,380
Next, Cocorico!

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,780
We could end it now, time-wise.

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
It's just getting started.

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,520
- They've already got enough usable footage, right?
- No.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,290
There was just one question, and you answered "Earth Marathon."

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,220
Really?

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,460
Let's go, Cocorico.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,490
Yoshimoto's 20!

38
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,100
[Buzzer Quiz]
This question is open to all teams.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
I see, buzzer quiz.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,530
We have a chance to do the same.

41
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,370
Why wasn't that a buzzer quiz earlier?

42
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,040
This is strange. Why is 20 a buzzer quiz and not 30?

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,140
Now, I'll give you a question!

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,880
Q. Who is the rakugo performer famous for saying "Welcooome" ?

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,150
Can I answer that?
Master Katsura Sanshi!

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,950
Correct!

47
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,990
Isn't that strange?

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,600
We all knew the answer already.

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,540
- You all knew the answer to this, right?
- Yes.

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,810
Is this just a quiz to see how fast we can answer the questions?

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,810
That's what a buzzer quiz is.

52
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:34,080
Also, I don't think it's good to add "Master"  to the answer.
It doesn't matter, though.

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:48,130
I think for an answer, you should say "Katsura Sanshi" without adding "master" or "san".
I was thinking about how Master would feel when he saw this.

54
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,300
Huh? What do you mean?

55
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,540
When master watched this broadcast, I think he wouldn't have wanted to be referred to as "master" in the answer.

56
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,440
That's just how he is.

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,340
So, considering Master's feelings, I don't think it's good.

58
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,340
But it's okay to give them points, right?

59
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,450
Hmmm, we need to discuss it.

60
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,080
No, they will get points.

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,350
You guys get the points.
Don't worry.

62
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,850
Let's move on to the next , Jicho-Kacho.

63
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,960
Riddle's 10.

64
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,700
Q. The top is a flood, the bottom is a fire. What is it?

65
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,870
Excuse me.

66
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,510
This is a question for Jicho-Kacho.

67
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,240
This is a question that only Jicho-Kacho can answer.

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,080
You should have said that from the beginning.

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480
I thought we were starting a buzzer quiz from the previous question.

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,290
That's not the case. It only becomes a buzzer quiz when "buzzer quiz" is written on the back of the panel.

71
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,590
It's confusing.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,320
I explained it earlier.

73
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,160
- You're a bad host.
- Yeah, it's confusing.

74
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,460
I explained it earlier. Please answer the question.

75
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,060
Bathtub!

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't understand the meaning.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,040
What does this mean?

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,680
That's exactly what it means. The answer is a bathtub, which is heated by burning fire underneath it while filled with a large amount of water.

79
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,480
I think there are other things like that.  There are other things where the top is on fire and the bottom is flooded.

80
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,220
It's the opposite if the top is a fire...

81
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,030
We can't move forward like this. Let's focus and do it properly.

82
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,300
- Okay, let's move on!
- This guy is a really bad host.

83
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,130
Football Hour got animal's 10 right without difficulty.

84
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,070
You guys get 10 points!

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,140
Now it's Downtown's turn!

86
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,910
It says "game", but what kind of game is it specifically?

87
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,050
I wonder what is written on the backakulalu....

88
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,880
Cocktail...

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,380
Yeah, I wonder what is written on the back of the panel.

90
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,390
Is that a bar drink?

91
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,660
No, it's not a cocktail.

92
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,260
-  Then, Game's 10.
- Okay, let's do Game's 10!

93
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,030
"What's in the Box?"

94
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,900
Wow, they have this kind of game too.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,570
Now I will remove this board.
So...

96
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,510
- I'll do this.
- Then I'm here watching.

97
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,610
Matsumoto-san should not look what is in this.

98
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,780
Really?

99
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,410
Can't I just watch it here?

100
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,280
Hamada-san will do this?

101
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,480
Yeah, but....

102
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,820
Don't look inside.

103
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,790
But...

104
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,220
So?

105
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,190
Which of you two would do this?

106
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,530
Hamada can't look inside?

107
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,630
Of course.

108
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,300
Then I won't do it.

109
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,930
- Hamada is not good at this kind of game.
- I can't do this.

110
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,630
"He is not good at this"?

111
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,270
Hamada can't guess something by touching it without knowing what's inside.

112
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,280
- But that's what a game is.
- If I can look what's inside, I'll do it.

113
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,480
Don't look inside.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,280
Please, let him look inside.
I can't let Hamada do that.

115
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,920
This is a game where you touch and guess something you don't know what it is.

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,120
But Hamada is not good at that!

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
I can't do that.
If I could look inside, I would do that.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,860
Please don't look inside.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,830
He didn't look inside.

120
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:19,170
So, are you forfeiting this and not getting any points?

121
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,070
Then, I'll do it

122
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,410
He will do it for me.

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,750
So Matsumoto-san will do this instead of Hamada-san?

124
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,620
This is what's inside!

125
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,150
[A. Germman]
(This is a character from an animated cartoon for young children.)

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,630
This is insane.

127
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,490
...Germman.

128
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,430
- This can't be a joke!
- This is so scary!

129
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know what it is...

130
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,440
But isn't it a germ one?

131
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,980
"A germ one"?

132
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,610
I have a feeling that it's something like that.

133
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,120
It's eerie that I know it without touching it, right?
But I know what it is.

134
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,060
I guess "germ one" is a little confusing, so maybe Germman?

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,830
Booyah!
You're amazing!

136
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,560
You may think it's eerie, but somehow I figured out what was in it.

137
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,000
Man, you're amazing!

138
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,170
Hamada-san told Matsumoto-san the answer from behind.

139
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,910
No, no, no...

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,540
Hamada-san was looking at the inside from behind Yamasaki-san.

141
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,080
Did he really do that?
Is that true?

142
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,910
He would never do such a thing.

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,850
I didn't see that.

144
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,720
Hamada definitely didn't do that!!

145
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,420
He definitely did that.

146
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,920
Hamada definitely did not look at it!!

147
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
Did he look at it?

148
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,420
He looked at it.

149
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,830
If Hamada looked at it and taught it to me, it's only natural that I could answer it.

150
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,030
Then why am I so happy?

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm really happy because I got the answer right!

152
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,370
Hamada would never say that!

153
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,840
And he has grown up so healthy and strong.

154
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,480
He's working so hard!

155
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,950
Don't say like that!

156
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,680
We can't do anything if you say that!

157
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,490
That makes us sound like we're just a bunch of cheaters!

158
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,620
When I looked at this box, I could see the germ inside.

159
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,860
Can you still see it now?

160
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
Can you tell the color of it?

161
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,360
Oh, I can't see it anymore now.

162
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,070
You could see it earlier, right?

163
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,470
Oh, that's all right.

164
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,010
Then I'll give them the points.

165
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,040
Thank you.

166
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,840
Now please return to your seats.

167
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,480
Next, Football Hour!

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,320
Okay, let's try a high point question.

169
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
Want to try?

170
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,190
- Can we try the higher scoring questions?
- Sure!

171
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,720
Then...

172
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,620
-Game's 40!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

173
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,930
Wait a moment.

174
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,560
What's wrong?

175
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,800
Hamada-san stepped on my foot.

176
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,400
- Really?
- It's okay. Sorry for stopping this.

177
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,140
Are you okay?

178
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,380
He's saying he got stepped on.

179
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,810
Hamada would never do such a thing.

180
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,310
I think so too. But...

181
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,180
I think Tanaka did it.

182
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,250
I would never do such a thing.

183
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,650
If that's the case, then Hamada would be even less likely to do something like that.

184
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,520
I didn't do that.

185
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,890
Sorry.

186
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,130
I'm sorry, I stopped the proceedings.

187
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,170
The next game is concentration.

188
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,340
Players take turns flipping over pairs of fruit cards that have been shuffled and placed face-down. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins

189
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,140
Let's start.

190
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,310
- Inoue seems to be good at this kind of thing.
- Yeah, he is good at games.

191
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,520
Next is Downtown.

192
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,360
This one and this one.

193
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,160
Please show me the face of the cards.

194
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,330
- Matsumoto-san?
- Hamada-san?

195
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,830
What are you doing?

196
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,230
Is it right?

197
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,770
- I can take whatever I like, right?
- No.

198
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,110
I took this one because I like oranges.

199
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,810
I like oranges and cherries.

200
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,810
- Hamada likes this the best.
- I like this so much.

201
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,480
He eats this all the time.

202
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
Isn't that what it means?

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,550
If you can turn over two cards with the same picture, you get the cards.

204
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,690
We took this one because we like it!
So it's ours!

205
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,830
We really like it!

206
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,860
We really like it more than Yamazaki thinks!!

207
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,430
We should do this properly.

208
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,040
- Please return the cards.
- Let's shuffle again and do it properly.

209
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,340
His face is making me irritated.

210
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,080
- You mean Iwao?
- Iwao's face is annoying.

211
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,980
Don't worry, Iwao.

212
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,520
Football Hour turned over the cards for pear and muscat, so it was a miss.

213
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,900
Oh, I saw this card just a moment ago!

214
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,030
- No, no, no, no...
- Matsumoto-san!

215
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,100
Now it's Jicho-Kacho's turn.

216
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,570
The rules are vague.

217
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,980
You knew there was a pear here, didn't you?
That was the card that was turned over the turn before.

218
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,610
I'm sure some of you guys couldn't remember where things are.

219
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,680
Sorry, give it back once.

220
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,720
You remembered it was here, didn't you?
So, which card did Inoue turn over?

221
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,020
Inoue turned it over by coincidence.

222
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,590
And I got a match!

223
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,030
No, you did not get a match, Matsumoto-san.

224
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,070
Okay, by the rules, Inoue gets this.

225
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,240
Hey, can't we just stop this already?

226
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,710
If the cards are face down, I won't know what's drawn on them.

227
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,850
There are still lots of questions left.

228
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,790
So, please pick one, Downtown.

229
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,160
- How about a riddle?
- Good.

230
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,520
Let's pull ahead of them.
50!

231
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,560
Q. What animal doesn't like the number 9?

232
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,000
What's the answer?

233
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,970
The animal doesn't like the number 9.

234
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,670
Disnina.

235
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,840
Yeah!

236
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,170
"Disnina"?

237
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,010
Of course not.

238
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,210
What is a disnina?

239
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,420
I don't know, but it is an animal named disnina.

240
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,150
You don't know that?

241
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,190
Anyway, the correct answer is a skunk.

242
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,790
That makes sense!
*[Sukan (Don't like) + Ku(Nine) = Sukanku(Skunk)]

243
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,000
That's the animal that dislikes 9, right?
It's a Disnina.

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,670
*[Ku (Nine) + Iya(Dislike) = Kuiya(Disnina)]

245
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,300
It dislikes 9.
Do you even know what that means?

246
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,570
It dislikes 9!

247
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,570
I know what it means.

248
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,010
The animal that dislikes 9, the disnina.

249
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,010
- But it's not real, is it?
- What kind of animal is a disnina?

250
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,010
I don't know, but it's an animal that dislike 9, so it's a disnina.

251
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,780
That kind of animal!

252
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,850
That kind of animal!!

253
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,220
Then give me half the points.

254
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,760
It has a tail!

255
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Listen, it has a tail.

256
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,060
You have to answer a real animal.

257
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,100
Then give me a few points.

258
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,730
- Just give me 10 points.
- Yeah.

259
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,610
I am not asking you to give me 40 points.
I should be allowed to get 30 points.

260
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,540
That's not possible.
If you had answered skunk I would have given you 40 points.

261
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,180
But they didn't answer anything.

262
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,080
Only I answered disnina.
So please give me 30 points.

263
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,720
- We have no right to answer this question.
- And let me say one more thing.

264
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Also, I couldn't see riddle's 50 at all because it was blocked by a flower.

265
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,190
In that situation, the answer I came up with after thinking hard was "Disnina".

266
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,530
Indeed, I couldn't see it from here.

267
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,600
I couldn't see it at all from here.
But I answered without any complaints!

268
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,270
It is an animal called disnina!!

269
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,310
It's not real.

270
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,010
What should we do?

271
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,480
Opinions are split down the middle.

272
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,410
Are you going to give us 30 points or not?

273
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,480
That's not a split.
I won't give you points.

274
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:27,590
Yamazaki can decide that.
If you want to give us 30 points, you can do so, and if you can't, you can give us 20 points.

275
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,660
I won't give you guys any points!

276
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Are we not able to receive any more points!?

277
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,640
No, I will give you points if you answer correctly.

278
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,400
Gotcha!!

279
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,940
Now let's go to Cocolico!
They were convinced!

280
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,280
Then Yoshimoto's 40.

281
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,920
Q. The comedian of the same generation as Kiyoshi Nishikawa who is still unmarried is the Sakata the *****?

282
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,760
Sakata the idiot.

283
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,690
That's not good for a senior.

284
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,160
You guys get 40 points.

285
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,800
You're lucky.

286
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,930
This is no good.

287
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,100
This can't be broadcast.

288
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,410
Master Sakata is not an idiot.

289
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,440
Of course I know that.

290
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,080
I don't want to be on the air with you guys.
Master Sakata is not an idiot at all.

291
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,480
- I know that.
- That's his comedy style.

292
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,920
I have seen many things that he is not an idiot.

293
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,720
He eats both the main dish and the staple food.

294
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,260
He never eats only main dish.

295
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,030
That's fine, I don't care.

296
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,400
But this is the kind of question this time.

297
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,570
So Goto thinks Master Sakata is an idiot?

298
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,440
I don't think so.
He calls himself an idiot because of his comey style.

299
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,680
Then who here thinks he is an idiot?

300
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,880
Raise your hand if you think he's an idiot.

301
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,650
No one.

302
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:02,690
But look at the question, it says, "Sakata the *****".

303
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,490
- The answer is nothing but an idiot.
- Do you think there is any other answer than that?

304
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,730
It's Sakata the bald.

305
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,760
Wouldn't he be more angry if you told him that?

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,930
- He hasn't actually been told that by anyone.
- I think he would be more angry if he were told that.

307
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,440
But that guy doesn't have much hair.

308
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,170
"That guy"!?

309
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,110
Then raise your hand if you think Sakata is bald.

310
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,510
What do you think?

311
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,320
He's definitely bald.

312
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,220
He looks like it, though.

313
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,820
He's bald, right?

314
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,860
He's bald, right?

315
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,890
See!

316
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,890
We all raised our hands.

317
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,660
Raise your hand if you think he is an idiot.

318
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,730
Not one.

319
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,240
About four years ago, Master Sakata came up to me and said in my ear,

320
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,310
"Macchan, I stopped putting hair fibers on my head."

321
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,070
He said that.

322
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,040
The less said about that the better.

323
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,280
He has never been called Sakata the bald.

324
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,580
Please give me the standard answer.

325
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,950
Okay,

326
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,220
Please give us 10 points for raising this problem.

327
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,720
I can't be done.

328
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,930
Give us 10 points because we noticed that he is bald.

329
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,060
We knew that, too.

330
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,930
We've all noticed that.

331
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,600
Is that so?

332
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,540
Hang in there, Jicho-Kacho!

333
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,470
Animal's 30!

334
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,810
It's a buzzer quiz!

335
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,210
Q. We asked...

336
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,080
So fast!

337
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,120
Downtown, go ahead!

338
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,960
Downtown, go ahead!

339
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,330
I couldn't hear the question.

340
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,700
The question was cut off.

341
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,260
Please let us hear the whole question.

342
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,930
You buzzed in before the question was finished.

343
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Okay?

344
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,310
I don't know the answer yet because I only heard part of the question.

345
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,910
This is a buzzer quiz.

346
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,080
So, may I count that as incorrect?

347
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,310
No, no, no...

348
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,450
You have lost your right to answer.

349
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,250
Once you lose the right to answer.

350
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,050
I wasn't informed about that!

351
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,190
I wasn't informed about that!

352
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,660
You told us to buzz in quickly, so I did.

353
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,660
But then I lost my right to answer.

354
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,930
Even though I was only told "We asked," I was asked to give some kind of answer.

355
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,130
Can't you see I'm nervous!?

356
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,870
Are you nervous?

357
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,840
I make mistakes like buzzing in too quickly because I'm nervous!

358
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,750
- May I answer something?
- Sure.

359
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,380
Polar bear.

360
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,590
Of course not.

361
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,460
Could you please repeat the question?

362
00:19:52,220 --> 00:20:03,270
Q. We asked 100 elevator girls. What is the ranking of animals they would want as pets?
#1: dog, #2: cat.
So, what's in #3?

363
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,640
Football Hour!

364
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,040
Rabbit.

365
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,010
Downtown.

366
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,580
Can you answer quickly?

367
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,850
Downtown, go ahead!

368
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,020
This is a buzzer quiz, you know.

369
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,960
Time's up!

370
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,660
Shut up, asshole!

371
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,060
"Shut up, asshole"?

372
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,970
Aquatic.

373
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,340
Incorrect.

374
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,640
- Jicho-Kacho!
- Hamster!

375
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,580
Downtown.

376
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,220
Terrestrial.

377
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,490
Please provide a proper answer.
Cocorico!

378
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,820
Turtle!

379
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,200
Hey, I buzzed in!

380
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,830
Time's up!

381
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,070
The correct answer is tropical fish.

382
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,010
That's unfair!

383
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,510
Those are aquatic!

384
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,950
If you answer with aquatic or terrestrial, it includes all creatures

385
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,950
I answered aquatic and it was wrong, so we were excluding aquatic animals from our consideration.

386
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,150
You guys don't do that, right?

387
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,820
Yes.

388
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,320
You should have said "close" to him.

389
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,430
Yeah, Itsumi-san would have said so.

390
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,230
-  Itsumi-san would have said so.
- I don't think so.

391
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,040
This is the final question.

392
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,810
If you get the answer to the final question right, you can get 100 points.

393
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,410
Really!?
It's a 100 points question?

394
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,450
Animal's 40!

395
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,850
[Buzzer Quiz]

396
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,120
Everyone has a chance to participate.

397
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:11,960
Q. What is in a camel's hump, which is essential for traveling through the desert?

398
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,970
Jicho-Kacho, go ahead!

399
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,530
Water!

400
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,040
Downtown, go ahead!

401
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,340
Some kind of extract.

402
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,450
Cocorico!

403
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,180
- Tanaka should know the answer!
- Alright! We can win this!

404
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,750
Fat!

405
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,860
So, the winner is...

406
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,200
Hey, hey, hey...

407
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,870
Can we really end it with "fat"?

408
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,770
There were a lot of things going on, and it ended with "fat".

409
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,840
Let's decide it with rock-paper-scissors.

410
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,240
Rock-paper-scissors?

411
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,580
What's the purpose of playing it?

412
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,080
It's to determine the winner.

413
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,280
On purpose.

414
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Who will be playing?

415
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,520
Hamada and Tanaka.

416
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,490
Hamada-san and Tanaka?

417
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,190
Anyway, let's play rock-paper-scissors once.

418
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,860
Even if you lose, it doesn't matter.

419
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,600
Right.

420
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,730
It has nothing to do with anything.

421
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,300
This is just for fun.

422
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,170
Yes!

423
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,440
Okay, let's play, Endo!

424
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,940
-  It's just for fun, right?
- Let's play, Endo!

425
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,510
Rock-paper-scissors.

426
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,650
Yes!

427
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,980
Congratulations!

428
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,250
Wait a moment!

429
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,290
We haven't done it with Hamada and Endo.

430
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,060
It's okay.

431
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,720
This is just for fun.

432
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,730
Rock-paper-scissors once.

433
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,860
Yes!

434
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,000
Alright, congratulations!

435
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,830
Wait!

436
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,900
The winner is Cocorico!
We will give you a trip to Hawaii as a prize!

437
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,340
Thank you!

438
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,950
This segment is tough.
Because I have to do it while thinking, "What the hell is this guy talking about?"
