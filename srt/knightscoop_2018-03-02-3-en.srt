00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,080
So, let's move on to today's last request.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:11,120
Yes! This request comes from the 23 y/o Atachi Ryouhei, a university student living in Osaka.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,260
"Day after day, it continues to be cold outside."

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,780
"For this reason, I always keep a pack of instant ramen at hand, and have a special way of eating them when it gets cold."

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,660
"I take the freshly made ramen along with the saucepan, and eat it inside a bath tub ..."

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,220
"... because by warming my body from both the in- and outside, it truly warms me from within the soul."

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,120
"But in doing so, I've come across a strange phenomenon."

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,800
"If I eat the ramen while the bottom of the saucepan is submerged in the bath water, the taste becomes sour to the point where I feel a tingling in my mouth."

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,340
"As long as the saucepan isn't submerged, the taste remains the same, but it changes once it's in the water."

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,400
"Is my tongue playing tricks on me? Detectives, could you try this experience along with me?"

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,140
"By the way, it only works with Sapporo Ichiban Shio Ramen!"

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,060
Have you had this experience?

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,020
Not at all.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,760
When you make ramen ... instant ramen ... you hold the saucepan by the handle.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,520
And you carry it like this.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,420
Now, when you submerge it into hot water and eat from it, you'll experience a tingling sensation.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,900
And when you lift it up again, you'll have the normal Sapporo flavor again. That's what he's saying.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,320
So what is it really like? Take a look.

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,800
So I heard that the client's house is a 4-story building.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,060
This is probably it.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,920
Even though it says it's a church.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm Detective Maeda with Tantei Knight Scoop.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
Please let me in.

24
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,380
So this house is a church?

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,240
Ah this is it, right? What a gorgeous church.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Residence on the 4th floor

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,560
They really have an actual place of worship in here.

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,800
Hard to imagine that a client would live here.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,220
We've made it to the 4th floor ...

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,040
Hello! Are you Ryouhei? - Yes!

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,300
So you live in a church? - The building is a church, yes.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,160
Was it opened by your parents? - Yes, my dad is a pastor.

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
Ah, is that so?

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,740
We're part of the Protestant Christian Church. - You're ProtestanD?

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,040
So how is ... - It's "-tanT"

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,980
But I said Protestant? - You said "-tanD" - That's just my voice.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,820
It's "ProtestanT".

38
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,600
ProtestanD? No?

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,700
It ends with a "T". Not a soft consonant. - ProtestanD?

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,760
It's "ProtestanT". - I said the same thing. - It ends with a "T".

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,180
A "T". It's "ProtestanT". - Yes, I get that.

42
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,420
ProtestanD. - No, "ProtestanT". - That's what I'm saying!

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,400
Now the real issue

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,220
When I eat the ramen, I get a tingling sensation. - From the ramen flavor?

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,680
It becomes sour. - Sour? - Yes, that's where the tingling comes from.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,820
So when you hold the saucepan and lift it up ... - Then it's safe.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,220
Just the regular flavor.

48
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,080
And when you put it back in ... - It tingles.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,740
It's like there's an electrical discharge.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:44,300
Like with the Super Nintendo ... when you would plug it out as a child and lick the power adaptor. - I didn't do anything like that!

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,120
When you plug it out ... - Ah, I get it! - It's that kind of flavor!

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,780
Ah I get it! So that's how it is? - Just like that!

53
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,520
When I was a student ...

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,940
There was this guy called Oshiro, who didn't have a Super Nintendo. He would come over just to do that.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,740
My mom would go: "This is bad, but you can't say anything about it at Oshiro's place."

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,840
He would just do it over and over again ...

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes, just like Oshiro!

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,180
We're going to spare you Oshiro's story

59
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:23,160
You can eat it regularly, but you can also dip it into the bath water and get the tingling sensation. It's a good deal, money-for-value-wise. - Money-for-value?

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,220
Two flavors in one!

61
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,780
To be honest, I didn't really want to tell you that. - No matter how much of a good deal it really is.

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,580
Ah, there it is! - Here you go.

63
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,900
How nice to be served straight away - aah, I like this style!

64
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,740
Eating the Sapporo Ichiban Shio Ramen normally

65
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,700
Ah you even put some sesame on it!

66
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,020
It's really tasty.

67
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,140
But still ...

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,700
... I wasn't feeling cold to begin with.

69
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,900
I see. It's not enough. - It just isn't.

70
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,440
The should eat it once they feel cold ...

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,120
So everyone at home will understand it, too. - You're right.

72
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,120
Ah, hello! You're his dad? - Good evening.

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,160
Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, I'm Atachi.

74
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,660
Hello! - This is a surprise.

75
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,400
This is our current problem. - The thing about eating it in the bath tub?

76
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,920
It's nice that even in your family home, you would allow him ... - I didn't, not even once!

77
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,560
I told him, "Don't eat in the bath!". When I entered the bath after him, there were noodles floating around.

78
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,300
You can't leave noodles floating around! - That was my mistake.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,120
Dad, what do you think? Will the flavor change?

80
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,320
Will it change ... ? I don't think it's possible, even if he says so.

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,600
No choice but to test it! - Go ahead.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,280
But dad, you see ... for this experiment ... in fact for any experiment ...

83
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,580
... the accuracy increases the more test persons you have.

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,280
That's right. - Right? So this time, to see whether the ramen flavor changes ...

85
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Raise the accuracy of the experiment

86
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,980
No way!

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,860
It's so cold!! - No way!

88
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,780
So now ... aaaaah ... there's a strong wind!

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,560
The wind is freezing! - Yes, it's really cold!

90
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,420
You can really feel the cold out here.

91
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,000
The three of us ... really, all three of us ...

92
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,940
Cooling down their bodies

93
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,140
... when it becomes really, really bad, we'll head back inside.

94
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,660
All three of us ... ooooooh!

95
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,360
3 minutes pass

96
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,240
Can you still go?

97
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,160
Is this necessary?

98
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,860
Is this necessary just to eat ramen?

99
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,360
5 minutes pass

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,840
It's so cold!!!

101
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,780
At this rate we'll get hypothermia.

102
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,800
7 minutes pass

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,580
Dad, how are you doing? The wind is too much!

104
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,200
At the next gust of wind! We'll go at the next gust!

105
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,220
It's locked!

106
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,580
It's locked!

107
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,980
Please come in!

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,360
Mom opens the door

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,800
Get the ramen!

110
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,400
There are only 2 cooking stoves!

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,540
Please hold this and wait for now.

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,520
It won't open!

113
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,080
Cold, cold, cold, ...

114
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,940
Ah it's warm, it's warm ....

115
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:04,900
Dad, I'm sorry, there's only enough space for one person! I'm sorry, there's only enough space for one person!

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,600
Why can't I fit in there?!

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,020
Why can't there be all three of ... - That's all part of the hypothesis we're testing!

118
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,680
That's not what we're testing for!

119
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,340
You can already eat that! Change places with me! Come on, come on, come on!

120
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,260
We need to stir in the flavor ... - Can't you switch places with me already?!

121
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,060
What's with this house?!

122
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,460
It's hot!!

123
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,960
It's so hot!

124
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,020
Man, it's hot.

125
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
Hoooot!

126
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,320
How can it be so hot!!

127
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,420
My request didn't include this!!

128
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,820
Let's eat it normally first. What does it taste like?

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,040
I ... I can't even tell ...

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
It's good! - It's good, isn't it?

131
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Now let's put it in the water! Slowly, see what happens!

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,260
It's sour! - No way, you gotta be lying!

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,460
The taste is really sour! - Are you serious? Really?!

134
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,460
It's sour! - I'll do it, too.

135
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,100
You're not kidding? It's actually sour? - Yes, absolutely!

136
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,840
FOR REAL!!?!

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,140
Right? It's really sour, isn't it?!

138
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
The taste is actually ... !

139
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,360
All of a sudden, it was so frikkin' sour! - Sour, right?

140
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
Are you kidding me?

141
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,380
Switch places with me!

142
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,800
Hot, hot, hot!

143
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,540
At first, normally

144
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,060
The same as always, right? - Now put it in!

145
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,660
My body is really warmed up now!

146
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,800
The same as always.

147
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,220
It's in the sauce pan! - It's different! You're using an enamelled pot!

148
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,920
Try it with this.

149
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,480
How is it?

150
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,360
Kind of sour, isn't it?

151
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,720
Right?! - It's actually kind of sour.

152
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,680
Like electricity? - I'm not sure about that, but definitely sour!

153
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,980
But it's really tasty in here.
