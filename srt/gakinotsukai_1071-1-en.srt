1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
If there's an animal nearby

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,480
I can't eat at all!

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,660
Around a month ago

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,650
(you can find this episode on shionnotsukai.wordpress.com)

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,650
Mayo

6
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,650
Nikori

00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,650
Sakuharu

8
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,650
Yamada Yoshi's House sleepover!!

9
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,650
Yoshi

10
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,010
In order to learn more about comedians as a producer

11
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,720
Heipo stayed in CowCow Yoshi's house

12
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,020
And then, even though he said he didn't like animals...

13
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,020
Heipo used to hate animals...

14
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,080
Affection for the dogs

15
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,000
What's wrong? Aren't you sleepy?

16
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,080
Heipo grew fond of Yoshi's dogs

17
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Heipo used to dislike kids...

18
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,480
Not only, our single-man Heipo didn't even like children...

19
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,650
Doting on Yoshi's kids

20
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,650
But then he fell in love with his kids

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,120
Heipo became more like a human, but what now!?

22
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,040
But what's in store now for our completely changed Heipo?

23
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,820
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai!
World Famous Heipo's Camp Trip with CowCow Yoshi's family!

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,980
Oh yeah!

25
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,480
Oh boy, this is our second time

26
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,680
Endo Shozo

27
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,680
Hamada Masatoshi

28
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,680
Heipo

29
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,680
Matsumoto Hitoshi

30
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,680
Tanaka Naoki

31
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,680
Yamazaki Hosei

32
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
It is
- Incredible

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,350
He already had a sleepover some time ago
- Let me say this

34
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,120
That episode had a huge response!!

35
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,680
And yet the viewing rate sucked...

36
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,680
Well---

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,780
Lots of people were surprised
a Gaki episode could be so touching

38
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,780
- I see

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,680
That's what I said, it improved Heipo's image to me!

40
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,620
But the viewing rate sucked...

41
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,460
Come on, enough with that!

42
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,460
Come on, it's fine

43
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,460
- Really...

44
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,600
It was really amazing...

45
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,720
Well, that's what, like, only two people told me...

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,960
It figures
- Come on!

47
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,680
That's enough, isn't it?

48
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
And I don't even remember who it was

49
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,520
That doesn't help

50
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,380
By the way, it meant so much to him

51
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,040
That after that, he gave the kids a present

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,720
After the On-air?
- Yes, unrelated to it

53
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Like, a toy or something?

54
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,520
Yes, for the record

55
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,080
He bought a Nintendo 3DS for Nikori and a bicycle for Saku

56
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,320
Nintendo 3DS

57
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,320
Present for Nikori

58
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,580
That's right

59
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,320
Bicycle

60
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,320
Present for Sakuharu

61
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,680
That's true

62
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,300
You paid for those?
- Of course

63
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,920
That's a lot, man
- Really

64
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,350
I was scared when he said "toy" at first, you know...

65
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,350
No way!

70
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,420
Somewhere in Tokyo

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,420
It's a day in August

72
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,500
Heipo heads to a public park to meet Yoshi's family,
which he first met around a month ago

73
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,720
Headed to a park to meet Yoshi's family

74
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Even the way
he walks has
changed
- You're right

75
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,520
staff) make sure to leave some good memories

76
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Of course, it's Summer, that's for sure

77
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,520
And I love them, you know!

78
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,860
Is it here?

79
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,880
Mr. Heipo!!

80
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,150
Aah~ It's been a while! How are you?

81
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,120
Oh my, you got so big, didn't you?

82
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,580
Hi there

Thanks for the 3DS, Heipo

89
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,080
Did you use it? Yes?

90
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,560
Incredible

91
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,380
The bicycle he got for him

92
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,020
That's a good bicycle

93
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,720
He's doing great

94
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,180
He looks good
- Did you buy the helmet too?

95
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,580
No, I didn't buy that

96
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Why didn't you? Geez

97
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,820
The game he got for her

98
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,480
You gave me this, right?
- Yeah, I really don't know much about it

99
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,550
I mean, there are so many DSs around!

100
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,220
They told me why am I buying it if I don't even know what it is!

101
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,220
What's going on, Saku-chan?

102
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,550
So cute, like always!

103
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,550
Ufufufu~

104
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,940
That's...

105
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,650
What a weird way to say it
- He's cute, that's a fact!

106
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,020
Camp Trip!!

107

Like this?

113
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,180
Going to the camp with Yoshi's car

114
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,550
Like this?
- Behind that

115
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,050
Are you excited?

116
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,120
Mayo (29 years old)

Wife

118
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,950
Not at all!
- You can tell his wife wanted to be only with the family

119
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,820
Their pet Chihuahua is going with them

120
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,820
Are you all ready?

121
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,780
We're off!
- Oh boy!

122
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,080
Alright, let's go

123
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,880
One, two and departu~re! let's go~!

124
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,820
One, two and departu~re! let's go~!

125
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,920
One, two and departu~re! let's go~!

126
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,920
- Alright kids, I'm ready

127
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
I wanna go!

128
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,150
Departure

129
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
Me too

130
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,630
And so, the trip for making good
memories for the kids has begun

131
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,460
They must be so excited for it

132
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,880
I can't wait!

133
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,880
That's right, I agree

134
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,580
What? That sticker has a scent?

135
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,340
Lemme see

136
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,300
Oh, you're right

137
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,950
Niko-chan loves to collect stickers

138
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,950
Niko-chan loves to collect stickers

139
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,420
Bye bye!

140
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,150
And also something else...

141
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,080
But she also likes...

142
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,850
♪ Heavy Rotation - AKB48

143
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,050
Who's your favorite idol, Niko?

144
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,120
Yuko Oshima

145
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,120
- Oh, I see

146
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,650
Is she your friend?

147
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh yes, I happen to know her

148
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,720
Eh? Really?

149
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,650
Most likely a lie...

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
Really?!
- Yeah, I know her

151
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,050
No way that's true
- No it's true, I know her

152
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,980
Niko-chan is obsessed with Yuko Oshima

153
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,720
You know a lot about her, don't you?

154
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Niko-chan really likes Yuko Oshima

155
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,720
It's been 2 and a half hours of driving so far

156
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,220
Arrived at Yasuragi-no-Sato camp, Ibaraki prefecture

157
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,220
They arrived at Yasuragi-no-Sato camp, in Ibaraki prefecture

158
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,220
serenity village

159
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,220
Pretty long ride, huh

160
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,780
They chose it so the city-raised kids can enjoy the nature

161
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,520
Camp site shrouded in nature

162
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,000
So, that's why you all drove for 2 and a half hours

163
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,150
The cottage where they'll stay for the night

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,130
But first, they head to the cottage where they'll stay

165
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,520
Let's go～

166
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,520
Such a nice place

167
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,750
- Really

168
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,540
But really... such a waste
to bring Heipo with them
- It should have been family-only

169
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,220
Alright, let's get in

170
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,320
Can't disagree on that
- He's such a burden

171
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,320
This is so good

172
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,520
Don't call me like that!
- But that's what you are

173
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,750
I want him to leave our planet Earth

174
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,750
Come on...

175
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,680
Heipo, come see the bathtub!

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,640
You want me to?

177
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,640
- Just go!

178
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,780
Follow him
- Don't question them

179
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
This one?

180
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,780
I bet the kids are so excited
- Totally

181
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,220
Watch your steps

182
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,080
Don't
- Pretty big, huh?

183
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,880
The kids are loving it

184
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,970
The kids are really enjoying the
nature surrounding this place

185
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,970
Why with your hands raised?

186
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,720
Alright, what do we do?

187
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,580
Let's go to the river!

188
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,450
Wanna go to the river?
- Let's go

189
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,480
Playing by the river

190
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,780
Can't we do anything about the skipping?

191
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,450
We should de-excite them a bit

192
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,750
Very excited

193
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:44,220
filmed by Yoshi

194
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,750
They're so lively

195
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,380
Look at them run

196
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,220
They're really excited!

197
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,350
Playing by the river to their heart's content

198
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,480
It's time to enjoy the nature to the fullest

199
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,150
But something happens to Heipo...

200
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,150
Something strange occurs to Heipo

201
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,150
- What now?!

202
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,850
Wait-- I dislocated my shoulder...

203
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,850
Can we go?
- Wait

204
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,220
I can't move my shoulder, what the?

205
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,220
Can we just go?

206
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,500
You know when I had to put on my seatbelt?
I put it like this

207
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,050
Dislocated shoulder!?

208
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,240
It's been hurting since that!
- Is it out of place?

209
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,480
I think it's fine, but...

210
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,620
It's probably ok

211
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,180
staff) you're moving it without problems!

212
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,720
But it's true! It hurts

213
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,350
He lied because he doesn't want to swim

214
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,350
Heipo refuses to swim so much he chose to lie

215
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,450
There's a reason for why he doesn't want to undress...

216
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,450
He says there's a reason for why
he doesn't want to get undressed

217
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,320
Sorry, director

218
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Watch out for your feet, you should wear some slippers

219
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,750
Hot hot hot hot hot hot!!

220
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,520
I have a pimple on my chest...

221
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
Can I keep my T-shirt on?

222
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,520
Are you embarrassed?
- Kinda

223
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,680
staff) undress, if you can...

224
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,240
Got it

225
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,020
He's embarrassed about the pimple on his chest

226
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Heipo still wants to be popular among the female audience

227
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,610
- What the heck!

228
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,640
Looks like he wanted to hide the pimple

229
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,980
Very aware of the female audience

230
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,630
Why the freeze frame? Come on!

231
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,280
It's pretty big, isn't it?

232
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,780
The kids are playing innocently by the river

233
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,720
A slide?
- Yes

234
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,950
Oh shi- it's so cold! Aah! Move aside, move!

235
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,870
Here I come

236
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,320
What the heck

237
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,950
Huh? My glasses, my glasses!

238
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,950
You have them on, you dumbfuck

239
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,080
Oh, I had them on me, geez...

240
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,870
What's going on?

241
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,680
You're wearing your glasses!

242
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,220
Of course you are

243
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,250
Attack!

244
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,750
Aaah! What are you doing?!

245
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,820
Oh, come on! You got me

246
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,550
I even drank some of it!

247
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,080
Watch out

248
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,420
Fully enjoying playing by the river

249
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,300
Heipo is enjoying the river with the kids

250
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,480
This place is great

251
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,180
Let's slide down together, Heipo!

252
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,980
She really likes you
- Yes

253
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,760
Hold firmly, Saku-chan

254
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,550
Can we do this together?

255
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,950
Is it gonna hold?
- I hope so

256
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,620
They're going--- what was that?!

257
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,380
It's so cold!

258
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,820
- Just take them off...

259
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,820
Oh shi--- I lost my glasses for real!

260
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,180
Look out for his glasses!

261
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,200
Over there, Saku-chan

262
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,050
Oh, here they are! Arigato! Thank you!

263
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,280
Sorry for that

264
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,480
Oof, save me

265
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,300
Were you tired?
- Definitely

266
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,380
Are you ok?

267
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,080
What's wrong?
- What was that for?

268
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,120
Ah-- ah- sorry, my feet hurt

269
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,380
He's listening to your complaints

270
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,050
The one who needs the most care is this 56-yo man

271
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,050
To grant the kids the best memories...

272
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,620
Over here!

273
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,720
After playing by the river, it's time
for bug-hunting in the forest

274
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,850
Bug hunting

275
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,980
Ah! I got a big one!

276
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,980
Eh?? What??

277
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,800
Nice one, girl

278
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,450
Look, a butterfly! Try to catch it

279
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,750
That's not rare at all

280
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,250
Seen anything?

281
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,080
Aren't you afraid of cicada shells?

282
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,450
Like this

283
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,580
Aren't you afraid of it?

284
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
- It's empty inside

285
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,820
See? The real cicadas are up above

286
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,750
He wants to let the kids touch the bugs

287
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,020
Here it is
- Way too high

288
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Yes, but that's how they do it

289
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,150
Oopsie daisy

290
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,220
Ah, I can't reach it at all! What the--?!

291
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,750
It flew away

292
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,750
It's gone...

293
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,120
Aaaaah! Agh--

294
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,170
It's a branch...
- You're making them worried

295
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,920
Traps for rhinoceros beetles

296
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,220
This is pretty awesome, isn't it?

297
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,480
Let's go get them back tomorrow morning

298
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,250
Dinner time

299
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,920
For dinner, he'll be making yaki-soba with the kids

300
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,920
Making some yaki-soba

301
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,480
- This is actually nice

302
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,280
Heipo, do you like yaki-soba?

303
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,000
- With the bbq and all

304
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
- I love it, it's so good

305
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,250
It looks so good, but there's a lot of it

306
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,220
It looks tasty
- Really

307
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,380
Do we need this shot?

308
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,550
Let's dig in!!

309
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,650
Maybe he smelled suspense in the air?

310
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,650
- It must have been that

311
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,320
The yaki-soba is great

312
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
- It's good, yes

313
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,820
So? Do you like your yaki-soba?

314
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
After dinner, they got back to their cottage

315
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,450
Back to the cottage after dinner

316
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,580
What's that thing?

317
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,580
I bet you all were tired

318
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,850
Touching the dog with ease

319
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Ah, that one...
- He's fine with it by now

320
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,420
Really

321
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,480
I think the dog wants to drink some water

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,140
Can I use this?
- Sure

323
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,350
Yes, that one should do it
- He's not afraid of it anymore

324
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,050
Look, his ears got all pointy-- he's going!

325
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,820
See? He really wanted to drink water

326
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,380
That means I was right

327
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,380
That's impressive

328
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,950
Yeah, I kind of felt that
- Is it really that impressive?

329
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,950
He understands how the dog feels

330
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,380
He barely did anything

331
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,380
- What's wrong?

332
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,550
Oh boy, you're so cute!

333
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
- The hell are you doing?!

334
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,000
It's not a problem!

335
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,250
Fireflies sightseeing

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,250
After resting a while in the cottage...

337
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,680
So many events...
- The children want to see the fireflies by all means

338
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,740
Heipo can barely stand up

339
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,220
Heading towards a spot near the river

340
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,920
They leave Mayo behind and go to
the river to see the fireflies

341
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
Let's go, Saku-chan. You ok, Niko-chan?

342
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,920
Are they gonna be fine?

343
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,080
Be careful!

344
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,880
I hope so
- I mean, that's scary

345
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,520
Wait for us, mama!

346
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,850
You should have sent your sister instead

347
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,180
Aren't you scared, Saku-chan?

348
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,820
Yoshi) Are you scared? You're good?

349
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,820
- You're ok?

350
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,780
Saku) I'm not scared

351
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,480
Saku-chan is amazing, isn't he?

352
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,480
A fearless 4-year-old boy

353
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,850
Aahhh... Aaaaaaaaah!!

354
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,820
Aahhh... Aaaaaaaaah!!

355
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,170
I stepped on something

356
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,680
I feel safe with papa around

357
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,550
Aaah! Something's there!

358
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,550
Eeeeeeeeeeeh!!

359
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,820
Oh shit

360
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,080
A 6-year-old girl toying with Heipo's emotions

361
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,080
You scared me! Pranks are no good!

362
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,620
Man, these kids are brave

363
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,550
Yoshi) Hear that? It's the sound of the river

364
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,670
I can clearly hear it, man, it's so scary in here

365
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,620
Arrived by the river

366
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,360
Watch your steps, ok?

367
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
It's a glove!

368
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,000
Look

369
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,480
This is some scary stuff

370
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,150
Aaaaaah! No way no way no way!!

371
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,720
- Eh? What's going on--?

372
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,220
There was something... I don't know

373
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
There was something... I don't know

374
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,000
But I felt something

375
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,220
Here he goes

376
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,250
That's a classic

377
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,250
Was there something there, Saku-chan?

378
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,280
Nothing
- That's a face I've seen countless times

379
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,080
Aaah!! Aaaaah!! Scaryyy~!!

380
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,450
Aaah!! Aaaaah!! Scaryyy~!!

381
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,080
There's something! Something! Something!

382
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,180
I saw it, it's here!

383
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,850
What the--?
- How can you be so calm?

384
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,620
Saku-chan is so brave

385
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,560
- He's a strong boy

386
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,060
This is scary, for real

387
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,580
You ok? Are you scared?

388
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,340
The kids must be so confused

389
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,480
I'm holding Niko-chan's hand so tight right now

390
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,200
They're gonna hate him    - Stay close, Niko-chan

391
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,650
Niko-chan annoyed by Heipo

392
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,770
Be quiet...

393
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,730
Wanna walk some more?

394
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,880
Where are the fireflies?
- Ahead

395
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,150
♪ Let's walk, let's walk, I am...--

396
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,480
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

397
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,150
Heipo) It's a tree, sorry

398
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,750
Come on...

399
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,720
Niko) Heipo is making me jump off all the time

400
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,320
- Yes...

401
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Niko) Go back home!

402
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,130
Go home--?!

403
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,380
She's right

404
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,380
Heipo) I don't wanna go alone

405
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,920
A ghost could pop out...

406
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,920
- No ghost will pop out

407
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,750
You're so strong, Niko-chan, let's just go

408
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,620
Niko) There's a cobweb in there

409
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,120
Niko) There's a cobweb in there!!

410
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,900
She snapped

411
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,980
Niko-chan is furious

412
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,340
- What's wrong?
You suck, man

413
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,780
Heipo is the only one shouting and ranting

414
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,780
Heipo is making a fuss over everything

415
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,950
Niko-chan got angry, and the
fireflies sightseeing is suspended

416
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,580
Fireflight sightseeing: canceled

417
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,720
Heipo was very scared

418
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,720
I was, wasn't I?

419
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,280
A lot

420
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,780
Papa was so strong, right Niko-chan?

421
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,660
I'm glad there was another adult with me

422
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Ignoring Heipo as much as she can

423
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,520
Sorry about that, by the way

424
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,520
It's time to sleep

425
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,220
The parents are concerned about their angry daughter

426
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,580
Niko-chan, wanna sleep here with Heipo?

427
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,620
Sleeping with Heipo so they
can be friends again

428
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,620
Are you ok by now?

429
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,950
The parents and Saku-chan
will sleep in the other room

430
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,310
Wife, husband and Saku-chan will sleep in the other room

431
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,020
Heipo and Niko-chan

432
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,720
Ahh--- the futon feels so nice
- It really does, huh?

433
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,520
Let's go to sleep, ok?

434
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,550
No! Picture book!

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,550
Want me to read it?

436
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,720
Yes, because tomorrow we can't

437
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,720
Right, I'm reading it

438
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, a recovery chance
- It's crucial

439
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,950
His figure reflected in the snow light...

440
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,850
Quarrel-solver picture book

441
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,980
Here
- Yes

442
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,150
The white-bearded old man put his hat back on...

443
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,320
Is this a famous book?

444
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,250
I don't think it's famous

445
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,250
So it's not, huh

446
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,850
But you are famous, aren't you?

447
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,850
In a way yes, I guess so

448
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,880
Looks like Niko-chan has forgiven
Heipo's attitude from before

449
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,520
Niko-chan has forgiven him

450
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,050
I can't sleep if it's bright...

451
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,250
You can't if there's a light? I see...

452
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,450
I prefer it when it's brighter, though

453
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,450
Who cares?

454
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,420
Whoa, you'll sleep soon

455
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,420
What does that mean?

456
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,480
Sleep well, ok? Alright, so cute

457
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Goodnight!
- "You'll sleep"...

458
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,520
Do you think Saku-chan is sleeping already?

459
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,520
I bet he is, he felt so sleepy before

460
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:11,180
The parents and Saku-chan

461
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,110
That snoring... is it Yoshi?

462
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,220
Holy cow
- That's impressive

463
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,850
Big trouble before parting!!

464
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,850
coming up

465
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,020
You can't make that face

466
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,920
The next morning

467
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,520
Going to get the rhinoceros beetle

468
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,270
The four of them woke up early to go check
the trap for the rhinoceros beetle they set

469
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,850
Let's go

470
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,460
Let's go, Saku-chan

471
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,980
Come on

472
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Is it here?

473
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,720
Oh, here it is! It's here!

474
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,500
Really?

475
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,420
It's a big one

476
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,790
This is incredible!

477
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,450
Go get it, it's here

478
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,720
Oh man, here we go

479
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,180
Here, I took it Saku-chan

480
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Check it out!

481
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,680
Noo～

482
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,680
What's wrong? You ok?

483
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,490
What's going on?

484
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,550
What--
- What's happening?

485
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,920
What the heck!!

486
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,100
What's going on?
- They're fighting

487
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,480
Siblings quarrel

488
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,720
What happened?
- What should I do...?

489
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,360
Where do you want to put it in?

490
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,920
You want it in your box?

491
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,850
You want it inside your box? I see, that's it...

492
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,850
He wanted it for him
- Ahh, I see...

493
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,700
As soon as I put it in, close the lid
- What about Niko now?

494
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,280
Like that, nice

495
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,380
Alright, Niko-chan, wanna take that stag beetle?

496
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,380
Nice, huh?

497
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,850
I don't wanna

498
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,850
Are you afraid of touching it?

499
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,150
It's a big one
- It is

500
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,920
It's a stag beetle
- A big one

501
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,020
Don't you want it, Niko-chan...?

502
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,020
- Put it in, Niko

503
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,380
This looks fine

504
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
There's a lot going on here

505
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,420
I can't open this up!! I'm getting mad

506
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,420
Heipo, can you open it for her?

507
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,580
Niko-chan's mood is awful

508
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,580
And now, Niko-chan's mood is awful

509
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,620
But it's almost time for their camping trip to end

510
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,220
How was the camp, Niko-chan?

511
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,220
I'll get you the change of clothes

512
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,020
Ignoring her dad's question

513
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,780
Oh no...

514
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,160
She's not in her best mood

515
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,520
The atmosphere is really tense

516
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,720
But Heipo has a surprise for the kids...

517
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,680
A surprise from Heipo

518
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,520
Well done
- Good one

519
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,620
AKB48 theater

520
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
That's actually nice

521
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,980
Heipo heard that both Niko and Saku are a fan of Oshima Yuko, so he reached her out

522
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:20,520
Oshima Yuko

523
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,660
And he managed to get her sign

524
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,520
Nice
- That's really nice

525
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:26,320
for Niko-chan and Saku-chan
stick with me some more!

526
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,280
With this, Niko-chan should rejoice
- Well done

527
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,320
Niko-chan's smile will return

528
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,350
Speaking of something else...

529
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,220
Who's your favorite girl from AKB?

530
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,350
Acchan (Atsuko Maeda)

531
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,220
Yuko Oshima, right?

532
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,220
No, it's Acchan (Atsuko Maeda)!

533
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
Huh?

534
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,050
"Acchan", unexpectedly

535
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,840
What?!

536
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,680
What a turn of events

537
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,980
But you said you liked Yuko Oshima...

538
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,750
I like Acchan more than her!!

539
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,520
Niko, don't say it like that

540
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,520
So stubborn...

541
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,680
She's being sassy

542
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,150
I got a sign from Yuko Oshima, you know...

543
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,150
Oh! Amazing!

544
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,180
Sometimes I meet her when I'm working...

545
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,920
That's a lie

546
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,120
It says "for Niko-chan and Saku-chan"

547
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,780
It's real

548
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,420
Incredible!

549
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,420
It's really incredible!

550
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,420
She wrote this for you

551
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,280
She made it for you, will you take it?

552
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,820
an unexpected conclusion!!

553
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,820
coming up

554
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,420
Niko-chan...

555
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,820
I got a sign from Yuko Oshima, you know...

556
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,820
Amazing!

557
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,450
Incredible

558
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,450
That's incredible!

559
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,450
She wrote this for you

560
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,680
That's so nice
of him

561
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,350
She made it for you, will you take it?

562
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,350
- Thanks so much

563
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,060
No problem

564
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,240
Alright, stand up

565
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,080
Come with me

566
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,460
She got angry
- Yeah...

567
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,150
You can't make that face now

568
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,150
That's not the face you should make
- She likes Yuko Oshima, right?

569
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,950
Yes, she's really happy about it, but...

570
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,950
- Yes, I kind of get it

571
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,750
Tell me what's the problem

572
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,480
We'll have to say goodbye to Heipo
in a few minutes, you know?

573
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,180
I don't...

574
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,880
Behave! What do you want to do?

575
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,620
I don't wanna...

576
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,620
Behave! What do you want to do?

577
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,970
Everyone's waiting, can you behave properly?

578
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,120
They can't wait for you to calm down at your pace

579
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,350
If that's so, just stay there

580
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,980
Heipo...?

581
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,550
Sorry for that...

582
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,550
It's fine, don't worry

583
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Don't make that face!

584
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,850
The mood before parting away is the worst

585
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,720
The camping trip should have been full of beautiful memories, but now the mood is the worst...

586
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,950
What will you do, Heipo?

587
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,750
Excuse me...

588
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,980
There's still something I want to give her

589
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,360
Nice, go

590
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,520
We're counting on you!
- That's the best thing he's ever done

591
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,380
The first?!
- In your entire life

592
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,020
Niko-chan?

593
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
Look

594
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,280

595
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,480
Together with this

596
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,080

597
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,880
Thank you so much...

598
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,600
Sure, and sorry

599
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,250
Hey...

600
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,150
I also have this secret sticker, only for you

601
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,380
Don't tell Saku-chan or he'll steal it, ok?

602
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,880
Let's go back, ok?

603
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,520
Makes sense...
- Very nice Heipo, you did great here

604
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,480
- It's fine, here's Niko-chan

605
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,480
Here we are

606
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,950
Take care of it, ok?

607
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,950

Sure, it's fine

611
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,150
Say you're sorry and give him a hug

612
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,880
A hug? For me?

613
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,080
It's fine, come here

614
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,680
