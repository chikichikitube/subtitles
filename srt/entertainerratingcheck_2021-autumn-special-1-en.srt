1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,000
Who Is The Real Celebrity,
an autumn of food and art,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,620
three hour special programme!

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,580
Our firstclass celebrities
have gathered here again.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,290
They'll identify firstclass items
like wine and musical instruments,

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,450
but it's autumn now, so we'll do
a very simple check on food and art.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,790
You'll naturally answer
all the questions correctly.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,700
They're watching closely.

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,830
Our viewers.

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,990
They'll say...

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,660
"They don't know something
so simple?"

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,830
First, it's Team Bigwig,
Mr Koji Ishizaka, Ms Mariko Kaga.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,450
Are you confident?

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,370
No.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,450
No?

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,870
You disappeared once.
I see.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,660
But how about Ms Kaga?

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,990
Ms Kaga has never paid,
so she doesn't know the price.

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,830
I want to say it once!

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,410
Senior and junior of
the same agency, Team K Dash,

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,160
Mr Masaaki Sakai
and Mr Katsunori Takahashi.

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,370
I have a lot of experience.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,370
That's right.

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,450
I think I'm going to answer
many questions correctly,

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,990
and break the record.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,700
Good, that's good.
Right?

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,870
And you, Mr Takahashi? There's
a chance you'll make him fall.

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,700
That's the role I play today.

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,330
You shouldn't! Give it your all.

29
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,290
Yeah.

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:36,290
Team Doctor X, Miss Ryoko Yonekura
and Mr Masanobu Katsumura.

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,040
You had disappeared as well...
We had.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,910
Are you confident this time?

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,450
But...
Compared to last time.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,450
I've accumulated much experience.
Of course.

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,250
Probably...
You can probably do it?

36
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,290
I guess we can.
I guess we can?

37
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,870
Team Visual Kei.
Mr DAIGO, Mr Sho Kiryuin.

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Mr DAIGO.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,410
To put it simply, it's ZI.

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
ZI...

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,790
What does it mean?

42
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,830
Zettai Ichiryu,
Absolutely Firstclass.

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,370
And you, Mr Kiryuin?

44
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,540
Talk more about it...

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,450
It's fine. Are you confident?

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,790
I came here with Mr GACKT last time.

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,330
The pressure...
At that time,

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,120
The pressure from Mr GACKT
was great,

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,700
the atmosphere will be cheerful
if I'm here with Mr DAIGO.

50
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,200
Wait, you're teasing Mr GACKT!

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,950
Absolutely not!
Really?

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,450
I'll answer all questions right.
Okay.

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,580
Next, three members
from Johnny's form

54
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,750
Team Gymnastics World
and Vanishing My First Love.

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,200
Well, Johnny's...
That's right.

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,040
They do everything skilfully.
That's right.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,080
That's right.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,250
Our senior, Chinen is here,

59
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,660
so there's a pressure
we have to get everything right.

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,160
But he doesn't look reliable at all.

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,160
I am obviously reliable.
I can do it.

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,620
You'll survive?

63
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,620
We will.

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,580
Two actors in the spotlight now,
Team The Words They Speak,

65
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,040
Miss Nanase Nishino,
Mr Kento Nagayama.

66
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,250
Who is the leader?

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,950
Miss Nishino...
What? Me?

68
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,120
He's my senior in every way.
That's right.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,830
But I heard our seniors...

70
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,410
had gone through things like that,
so I'm a bit nervous.

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,540
They look important, but they
disappeared. So do your best.

72
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,080
I want to keep the fluffy slippers.

73
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,870
Please do your best.

74
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,200
Team Comediennes And Idols,
Borujuku and Sakurazaka46.

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,410
Maybe you'll be fine
if it's just the three of you,

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,870
but you've also got those three.

77
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,330
It's food today, right?

78
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,040
It's possible that
only we will survive.

79
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,910
We'll be fine.

80
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm sorry, but it won't look good
if only you three survive.

81
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,290
It's okay, just show Tanabe, then.

82
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,000
Only her.
Wait...

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,040
Zoom in at me.

84
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,830
The theme of this episode

85
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,040
is an autumn of food and art,

86
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,750
so we've prepared various tests

87
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,080
about autumnal things like food,
music and painting.

88
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,750
They'll distinguish the pro
from the amateur

89
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,040
in the Taiko Drum performance.

90
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,410
Wow!

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,700
You're in high school?

92
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,910
Yes, students from
Japan Aviation High School.

93
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,500
Wonderful.
Amazing.

94
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,580
The high school students
will compete with the pro,

95
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,290
the performance of their souls
will cause drama!

96
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,040
If they answer the questions wrong,

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,580
their rank will fall immediately
till they reach the abyss,

98
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,000
and disappear at the end.

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,620
Let's start now!

100
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,830
This is the first test.
Have a look!

101
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,330
It's matsutake mushroom.

102
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,990
It's food in autumn.

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,200
That's right, matsutake mushroom
is the symbol of autumn food,

104
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,950
you'll try
a matsutake mushroom Dobin Mushi

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,330
and a soup that tastes like
matsutake mushroom,

106
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,790
but without any used.

107
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,330
You'll compare the two
and tell us which one is real.

108
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,370
For the correct Dobin Mushi,

109
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,200
expensive matsutake mushroom
from Iwate Prefecture

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,450
that costs 12,000 yen
per 100 grams is used.

111
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,250
The other one is an instant
matsutakelike soup

112
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,450
that used artificial flavouring
to imitate the flavour of matsutake.

113
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,250
You'll just distinguish the real one
from the instant one.

114
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,160
It's easy.
That's right.

115
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,120
They will be the representatives.

116
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,120
Just so you know,
if you get it wrong,

117
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,410
you'll be too embarrassed
to walk outside.

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,080
Okay, representatives,
please go to the waiting room.

119
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,200
Thank you.

120
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,950
Do your best...

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,410
Please go from the door there.

122
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,330
See you.

123
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,790
I hope no chair will be changed
when they come back.

124
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,500
Is it okay to let her go first?

125
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,080
I'm a bit worried,

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,660
but she looks like matsutake
mushroom in the outfit today.

127
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,750
Oh, stop it!

128
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,660
The first contestant is this lady
in her matsutake mushroom outfit.

129
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,370
It's Miss Yonekura.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,290
She eats lots of delicious things.
Of course.

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,410
It's the first one, so it matters.

132
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,200
What?

133
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Is it okay?

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,370
Probably.
You're okay?

135
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,410
Okay, let's go.

136
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,370
First, it's A.

137
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,040
She checks the rising aroma
very carefully.

138
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,990
I think I already know.

139
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,160
"Dobin Mushi A"

140
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,080
You definitely shouldn't hesitate.

141
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,040
Mr Katsumura, does the look
on her face say she knows?

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,620
She's already at a loss.

143
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,830
I wish I could do this.

144
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,540
Next, it's B.

145
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,040
"Dobin Mushi B"

146
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,750
She keeps smelling it.

147
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,830
She keeps smelling it.

148
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,950
She finally drinks it.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,620
She was afraid to drink it.

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,370
Oh?

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,790
Okay, she tried both A and B,
which one will she hold up?

152
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,660
What?

153
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,540
May I?
Her answer is...

154
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,500
This!

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,080
Oh, B...

156
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,200
B wasn't very fragrant...

157
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,990
Wait, should I choose
the fragrant one?

158
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,830
Am I deceived like that?

159
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,200
This is bad.

160
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,910
She is totally at a loss.

161
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,660
If I can choose...

162
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
it'd be B.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,910
What's that?

164
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,250
Why does she choose like that?
"It'd be B."

165
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,250
"It'd be B."

166
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,990
The lady who never fails chose B
after hesitating for a long time.

167
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,950
I'll go in.

168
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,540
I'm the first one,
so nobody is here.

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,620
It feels good. I'll have a seat.

170
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,290
"She can watch
the other people's tests"

171
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,910
She'll watch the other people
on a monitor here,

172
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,250
and wait for the result
to be announced.

173
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,990
Next, it's this gentleman.

174
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,790
Okay, the next one

175
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,660
is Mr Katsunori Takahashi.

176
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,870
Katsunori, you can do it!

177
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,410
Katsunori, pick the right one.

178
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,790
His toned body doesn't look like
a 56yearold's,

179
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,620
firstclass actor
Mr Katsunori Takahashi

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
can still do action scenes.

181
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,540
I haven't tried Dobin Mushi
many times.

182
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,370
I've been to many
good restaurants, though.

183
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,910
Of course.
Yes.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,870
But you'll fall together
if you fail.

185
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,790
That's...

186
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,120
Even if you say that to me...

187
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,200
It's the first time I see Katsunori
so nervous.

188
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,580
Oh?
I feel sorry for him.

189
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,830
His teammate

190
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,500
is much more senior than him
in his agency and showbiz,

191
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,870
so Mr Takahashi can't afford
to downgrade him.

192
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,500
So quick.

193
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,500
Taste it.

194
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,080
It looks like he's drinking sake.

195
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,950
Isn't he drinking too much?

196
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,910
He should taste sip by sip...

197
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,450
Drink water. Water!

198
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,000
Right?

199
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,910
He's a bit careless.

200
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,910
Yeah.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,160
Drink water.

202
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,830
He isn't going to drink any.

203
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,830
Drink water!

204
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,910
You're so noisy!

205
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,750
Without resetting his taste buds,
he goes on to try B.

206
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,500
"Dobin Mushi B"

207
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,370
He just drank B.

208
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,120
I see.

209
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,870
It'll be cool if he guesses right.

210
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,500
The taste is delicate.

211
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,370
He drinks the water now.

212
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,950
What's the point
of drinking water now?

213
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,700
His answer is...

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,660
Oh!

215
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,660
"Dobin Mushi B"

216
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,080
Oh!

217
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,370
Thank goodness.

218
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,200
"Feels relieved"

219
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,950
The taste of B is a bit peculiar.

220
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,750
So I think it's this.

221
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,750
I see,
Miss Yonekura feels relieved too.

222
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,950
Someone will go there.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
I see, to the room, right?

224
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,200
It'd make her nervous
if their answers were different.

225
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,200
Here it comes! Salary Man Kintaro
joins Michiko Daimon!

226
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Oh...

227
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,790
Thank goodness!

228
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,580
Oh, I see...

229
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,790
No?

230
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,250
I thought it would be B.

231
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,500
I think it's here too.
Right?

232
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,040
By the way, Ryoko Yonekura
disappeared last time.

233
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,410
Yeah.

234
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,950
Next, it's this lady.

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,290
It's Miss Kaga.

236
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh? Here she is.

237
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm somehow nervous.

238
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,040
Proves that you're alive.

239
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,790
After she debuted at 17 years old,

240
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,870
firstclass actress Ms Mariko Kaga
had been active at the forefront

241
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,540
for 60 years.

242
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,330
Ms Kaga,
matsutake mushroom Dobin Mushi...

243
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,870
I'm very confident.

244
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,700
Whether it's artificial or not...

245
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,330
Obviously.

246
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,370
The very confident Ms Kaga
tries A first.

247
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,200
"Dobin Mushi A"

248
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,250
Somehow...

249
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,580
Maybe she hadn't
tried it a lot before?

250
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,870
She's been smelling it.

251
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,450
Maybe.

252
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,750
Ms Kaga seems sure about it.

253
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,080
Next, it's B,
which currently outnumbers A.

254
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,250
"Dobin Mushi B"

255
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,040
Oh?
What will she choose?

256
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
What?

257
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,000
Which one will Ms Kaga hold up?

258
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,750
Her answer is...

259
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,250
"Dobin Mushi B"

260
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,830
Wow...
It's B.

261
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,200
Everyone chooses B.

262
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,410
Yes!

263
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,790
It was difficult,

264
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,750
but this one was more awful.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,830
What? She said something serious.

266
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,620
It was awful.

267
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,700
She held up the one she thought
was real and said it was awful.

268
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,080
Wow!

269
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,580
It was the first time.

270
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,250
The sharptongued actress
Mariko Kaga also chooses B.

271
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,160
Thank goodness!

272
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,330
It must be this.

273
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,540
Yeah.
We're okay.

274
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,450
Thank goodness,
I hope we all guessed right.

275
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,540
They all chose B because
there was no decisive factor.

276
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,250
It is going to be dramatic.

277
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,290
"Dramatic from question 1"

278
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,200
His grandfather
is a former prime minister,

279
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,250
his wife is Keiko Kitagawa,

280
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,580
firstclass celebrity Mr DAIGO
is from a grand family in real life.

281
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,000
To be honest, I tried
matsutake mushroom the first time

282
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,290
when I was in primary four.

283
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,000
Wow!
I'm impressed.

284
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,750
While I'm a vocalist, I'm also
a "Dobin Mushist" of matsutake.

285
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,450
Okay, how about you?

286
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,660
Talk longer...

287
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,000
Before I drink it,

288
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,410
may I take off my gloves
for good manners?

289
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,330
Do it before you start!

290
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,250
You do it now?

291
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Take it off before you go in!

292
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,950
He has good manners.

293
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,040
I'll try.

294
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,120
Can he identify the taste he's been
familiar with since primary four?

295
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,700
"Dobin Mushi A"

296
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,080
He didn't smell it.

297
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,410
He drinks it right away.

298
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,750
I didn't know there was matsutake
when I was in primary four.

299
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,660
Next, it's B.

300
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,950
The rock singer who has been eating
matsutake for 33 years,

301
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,700
which one will he choose?

302
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,290
"Dobin Mushi B"

303
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,120
It seems B is better...

304
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,450
I'll say it.
His answer is...

305
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,750
The correct answer is...

306
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,660
B.

307
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,660
"Dobin Mushi B"

308
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,410
I first tried matsutake mushroom
in primary four.

309
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,000
It's the only thing he says.

310
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,660
It isn't too rich,

311
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,750
the taste is just right and perfect.

312
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,660
Ms Kaga said it tasted awful.

313
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,910
So far, all four chose B.

314
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,200
It's unusual.

315
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,830
Oh, glad to see you!

316
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,620
I'm happy.
Yay!

317
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,750
Lovely.

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,750
That's the 33 years of experience.

319
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,160
I'm so happy!

320
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,990
This must be the right answer.

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,080
Have a seat.

322
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
It does make us feel relieved,

323
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,660
but they could all fail together.

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,990
What drama are we going to see?
It has to be dramatic.

325
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,580
Winner of Japan Academy Film Prize's
Newcomer of the Year,

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,990
Mr Kento Nagayama is active in films
and dramas

327
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
with his solid acting skills.

328
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,290
First, he tries A,
which hasn't been chosen by anyone.

329
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:43,160
"Dobin Mushi A"

330
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,450
Next, it's B, which everyone chose.

331
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,750
"Dobin Mushi B"

332
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,450
Which one?

333
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,120
His answer is...

334
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,620
Miss Nishino, I'll guess it right.

335
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,910
"Dobin Mushi B"

336
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,120
Everyone chooses B.

337
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,160
I have a feeling that B has
the original flavour

338
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,330
of matsutake mushroom.

339
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,500
If A is the correct answer...

340
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
What should we do?

341
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,700
"Worried because
there are too many people"

342
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,870
We can't go back.
I don't think it's possible.

343
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,500
Now, five people chose B in a row.

344
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,290
Yay!

345
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,700
Welcome!

346
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,200
Welcome...
Thank goodness...

347
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,250
Oh, thank goodness.

348
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,500
Sakurazaki46's Risa Watanabe,
Hono Tamura, Ten Yamasaki.

349
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,540
The top idols are popular for
their overwhelming performance.

350
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,830
This is the first test.

351
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,250
But Dobin Mushi...

352
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,950
Can you tell?
This is bad.

353
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,450
Are you guys okay?

354
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,990
Maybe we should let Tanabe do it.

355
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,290
Get it right and come back.

356
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,790
We'll do our best.

357
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,580
The young girls haven't really tried
matsutake mushroom before.

358
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,290
At their age, they'd think
instant soup tastes better.

359
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,830
Right?
Indeed.

360
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,160
"Dobin Mushi A"

361
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,000
Please...
Please.

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,750
Which one will the idols' taste buds
think is the real one?

363
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,450
"Dobin Mushi B"

364
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,540
Will their opinions be different
or the same?

365
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,000
It'd be surprising
if they're the same.

366
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,200
It'd be impressive.
It'd be impressive.

367
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,250
Yeah.

368
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,790
The girls' answers are...

369
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,700
No...

370
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,370
Different.
Different.

371
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,500
Their thoughts are different.

372
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,660
The senior, Watanabe chose A.

373
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,250
That's right.
Yeah.

374
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,250
The one in the middle is the senior.

375
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,410
Miss Watanabe.

376
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,290
The taste of B is milder,

377
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,750
and it was very easy to drink.

378
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,620
What I think is the exact opposite
of Hono's,

379
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,750
A is milder,

380
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,750
and B is richer than A.

381
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,080
Maybe I got it wrong,

382
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,450
but I could taste a bit
of the fragrance of yuzu.

383
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,620
B?
Yes.

384
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,160
So I'm confused now.

385
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,950
Let's choose B.
Shall we?

386
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,910
B...

387
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,040
B!
They decided to choose B.

388
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,790
The senior compromised.
Well done!

389
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,750
It's unusual.

390
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,000
It's good team work.

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,040
If it is as biased as this...

392
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,620
They look like they're at a funeral.

393
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,450
What the heck?

394
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,040
Right? It's weird.

395
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,950
"Gradually getting worried"

396
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,330
They don't want more people to come.

397
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,450
Excuse me.

398
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,500
Yay!

399
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,500
Thank goodness!

400
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,870
Thank goodness!

401
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,200
Is B the correct answer?
Or will there be a plot twist?

402
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,410
Lastly, it's this team.

403
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,500
Okay, the last team.

404
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,620
Do your best.

405
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,000
The boys...

406
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,160
What will happen?

407
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,870
From the two groups in Johnny's
that will lead the next generation,

408
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,080
Snow Man's Mr Ren Meguro

409
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,290
and Naniwa Danshi's
Mr Shunsuke Michieda.

410
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,500
My seniors had treated me
to matsutake mushroom before.

411
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,120
I've never tried matsutake.

412
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,620
Let's see what will happen.

413
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,580
I'll do my best not to make us fail.

414
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,540
Right?
Yes.

415
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,750
They're the exact opposite. One has
tried matsutake, but one hasn't.

416
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,540
"Dobin Mushi A"

417
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,700
They first taste
Dobin Mushi A carefully.

418
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,410
They just drink the soup.

419
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,870
Next, Dobin Mushi B.

420
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,620
"Dobin Mushi B"

421
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,910
What will they choose?

422
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,750
What will they choose?

423
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,160
Okay.

424
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,660
What's the answer
of the two centres of attention?

425
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh?

426
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,250
It's different.
What will they choose?

427
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,660
Different answers.

428
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,750
A tasted richer.
It did.

429
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,000
B is a bit light.
I know what you mean.

430
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,000
One would imagine the instant soup
to be richer, but...

431
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
I totally know what you mean.

432
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,080
But if you think in a different way,
because they use good matsutake,

433
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,450
I think maybe they would
intentionally make the taste richer.

434
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,410
What will they do?

435
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,080
It's hard to choose.
What will they do?

436
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,950
I chose B because I was at a loss...

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,290
I couldn't decide either.

438
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,540
I'll trust you about
the taste being rich.

439
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,870
Finally A.

440
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,080
I'll choose A too.

441
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,330
A? Is it okay?
A.

442
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,620
"At risk"

443
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,910
The B group is speechless.

444
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,450
It's possible only they'll win.

445
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,160
It'll be amazing if it's A.
Yeah.

446
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,330
Pay attention to their faces
the moment they open the door.

447
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,370
Whoa, we messed up.

448
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,750
Did we mess up?

449
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,950
Nobody is here?

450
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,700
That happens?

451
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,040
Oh, this...

452
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,160
Are you kidding me?
It's full!

453
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,830
Everyone went to B.

454
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,080
The correct answer is...

455
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,750
Please!

456
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,290
The fateful announcement
of the result!

457
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,410
Thank you for your patience,

458
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,950
Celeb Master will go to the room
of the correct answer, please wait.

459
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,990
Please, let it be B.

460
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,790
Here I am!

461
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,870
Ah...

462
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,950
It's totally possible
that we're right.

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,580
Let's be confident that it's A.

464
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,790
Okay!

465
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,290
Please come!

466
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,950
Okay, I'll open the door
of the correct answer's room.

467
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,700
Come here...
Really, come here!

468
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
I'm scared.

469
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,200
"Wins alone if it's correct"

470
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,950
The correct answer is...

471
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,790
Please!

472
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,700
What?

473
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,370
Congratulations!

474
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
Of course...

475
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,410
Congratulations!

476
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,580
Of course...

477
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,790
"A: Incorrect"

478
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,870
Are you kidding me?

479
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,250
Wait a minute...

480
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,370
This is horrible!

481
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,120
Good...

482
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,370
Good!
You did it!

483
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,700
Well done!

484
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,540
I'm impressed. Well done.

485
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,120
Okay, let's go,
everyone who got it right.

486
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Darn it! It's so frustrating!
So embarrassing.

487
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,250
Everyone who answered correctly
is back.

488
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,160
Congratulations. It's amazing.

489
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,410
Brilliant.

490
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,750
Amazing.

491
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,580
Please go to your seats.

492
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,700
Brilliant.

493
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,040
You did very well.

494
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,330
Stop dancing!

495
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,790
We did it.

496
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,580
You did very well.

497
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,200
The people who got it wrong
are back.

498
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,200
Come in.

499
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,910
"Entrance for wrong answer"

500
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,080
I'm sorry, Mr Chinen.
I'm sorry, Mr Chinen.

501
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,660
Please return to your seats.

502
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,200
I really don't want to return
to the studio.

503
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,540
"Ordinary"

504
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,830
Only one team was downgraded.
It's an excellent start.

505
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,450
However...

506
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,330
An unexpected serious incident
happens after this.

507
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,660
Yes!

508
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,410
I can't stand this guy!

509
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,540
This is the next test.

510
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,160
"Cello"

511
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,450
It's cello.

512
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,660
Everyone makes noises.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,500
Autumn is the perfect season
for classical music,

514
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,620
you'll listen to a piece played
on cello, the musical instrument

515
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,870
loved by Japan's famous writer,
Kenji Miyazawa.

516
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,250
The finest quality cello that is
the right answer was made in 1694,

517
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,250
by Italy's Giovanni Grancino.

518
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,700
The market price is 120 million yen.

519
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,580
The valuable cello can be called
a cultural heritage in the world.

520
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,580
That's right.

521
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,540
The wrong answer is a cello borrowed
from a music college student.

522
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,580
Yes.

523
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,950
Both cellos will be played
by firstclass cellist,

524
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,290
Ms Sonoko Muraoka.

525
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,620
Both cellos will be accompanied
by a Steinway piano.

526
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,000
That's right.

527
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,990
A 120 million yen cello
and a music college student's cello.

528
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,080
Okay?

529
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,450
Naturally you'll get it right!

530
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,700
During the first test,

531
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,250
you've been watching the screen
and enjoying yourself.

532
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,000
You'll go next.

533
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,830
Don't say something like you won!

534
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,750
After he drank the soup,
you went, "Drink water! Water!"

535
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Everyone stays in firstclass
besides the three Johnny's guys.

536
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,700
It's a good result, but something
unbelievable is going to happen.

537
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,910
Representatives,
please go to do the tests.

538
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,160
Please.

539
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
This way.

540
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,160
Please come here.

541
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,700
Please be firstclass.

542
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,290
That's right.
Yes.

543
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,120
Have you acted
with anyone here before?

544
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,450
I don't think so.

545
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,370
Not Miss Yonekura, either?

546
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,830
I haven't either.

547
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,500
But I told her just now too,

548
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,200
the reason I debuted, the one who
chose me to join this world

549
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,580
was Ms Mariko Kaga.

550
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,160
That's right.

551
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,830
I had participated in
the Japan Bishojo Contest,

552
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,830
I was told the reason I won
the Special Award was because

553
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,080
Ms Kaga nominated me.

554
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,830
Wow!
Amazing!

555
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,410
Thank you so much!

556
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,830
Oh, is that so?
Yes.

557
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,910
While the great actresses
talk about the past excitedly,

558
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,200
the first three teams have come.

559
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,250
Well then, see you.

560
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,200
Wait...

561
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,200
Mr Masaaki Sakai has been an actor
for 70 years,

562
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,700
he is one of the leaders in
Japan's group sounds and a legend,

563
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,500
he can't answer the question
on music wrong!

564
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,950
Cello is a musical instrument.

565
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,370
Musical instrument.
My ears are reliable.

566
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,160
I see. Your ears are still good?

567
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,160
Of course.

568
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,870
Are your ears still good?

569
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,120
Pardon?

570
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,000
You know,

571
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,500
the way you talk to me

572
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,040
stresses me out most!

573
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,040
Please do your best.

574
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,370
How can I not?
Of course.

575
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,750
Participating in
the Kohaku Uta Gassen four times,

576
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,990
Golden Bomber's Mr Sho Kiryuin.

577
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,500
"Golden Bomber, Sho Kiryuin"

578
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,700
I'm a musician who writes
lyrics and songs,

579
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,000
I flatter myself that I've listened
to various kinds of music.

580
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,250
Also, I answered many questions
wrong last time,

581
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,040
so I must get rid
of my bad reputation now.

582
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,450
Yes.
Of course.

583
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,250
Miss Nanase Nishino
gained popularity

584
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,410
as Nogisaka46's
first generation member,

585
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,790
and is now active as an actress.

586
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,790
I had sung some songs in the past,

587
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,500
I think I'll be okay.

588
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,250
You'll stay firstclass?
Yes.

589
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,620
Which one is the sound

590
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,370
of the world's best cello,
which costs 120 million yen?

591
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,200
Please think together with them.

592
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,120
"Cello A, Cello B"

593
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,370
It starts now.

594
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,790
Let's listen as well.
Okay.

595
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,000
First, it's Cello A.

596
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,750
Isn't Mr Masaaki dying?

597
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,620
I think he's still fine.
Yeah?

598
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,000
Maybe he fell asleep.

599
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,080
Next, Cello B.

600
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,410
Viewers, do you know which one?

601
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,450
What do you think?

602
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,160
We both think it's B.

603
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,750
We think it's B.

604
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,660
I see.

605
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,950
What does the trio there think?

606
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,910
Our answers are the same.

607
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,830
Really?
Yes.

608
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,250
It's B.

609
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,540
Really?
Yes.

610
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,540
You are also a musician,
so I'll ask you.

611
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,990
Well, my actual job is musician.

612
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,330
Well, it's B.

613
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,990
Wow, that's amazing...
Yes.

614
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,330
I think it's A.

615
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,290
A?

616
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,990
Why do you think so?

617
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,870
The high note played by B
kind of bothers me.

618
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,580
It was so...
You heard that?

619
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,750
I did...

620
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,040
I heard that.
The look in your eyes was scary.

621
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,700
Naturally I would.
I'm sorry!

622
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,000
It's...
I said sorry!

623
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,830
Okay, okay, sorry!

624
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,330
I think it's A.

625
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,370
I see.

626
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,160
It sounded like cello.
It's a cello, though.

627
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,080
Okay.

628
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,830
Everyone at the studio chose B,
except Mariko Kaga.

629
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,910
Which one will the legend of
Japan's music industry choose?

630
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,080
"Masaaki Sakai"

631
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,200
Which one will Mr Sakai say?

632
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,660
I'm counting on you.

633
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,370
His answer is...

634
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,790
What's he doing?

635
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,870
What are you doing?

636
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,000
Hurry up!

637
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,910
Hurry up!

638
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,830
It's so long.
Masaaki!

639
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,580
B.

640
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,370
Right?

641
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,580
For cello, how natural the low notes
sound matters most.

642
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,700
In that sense,

643
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:32,160
A sounded like a young
musical instrument.

644
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,950
It has to be B!

645
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,990
Mr Katsunori, do you agree?

646
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,620
Yes, I also think it's B.

647
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,200
I see. You agree with him?
Yes.

648
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,120
Okay.

649
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,620
Mr Masaaki didn't hesitate
to choose B.

650
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,370
Excuse me, I'll sit confidently
on a chair.

651
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,250
"Waiting room B"

652
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,330
Okay.

653
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,540
Depending on what
the Kohaku singer chooses,

654
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,750
the situation will greatly change.

655
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,540
Can Kiryuin do it?

656
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,290
I'm counting on you!

657
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,040
Speaking of Kiryuin,

658
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,370
when he came with GACKT
and did the musical instrument test,

659
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,330
only he answered the important
music question wrong...

660
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,250
I'm very sorry.

661
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,580
He slid to kneel in front of GACKT
in this dark past.

662
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,410
He must not make a mistake
this time. What's his answer?

663
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,660
It's B.

664
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,700
Yes!

665
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,410
The sound from the low to midrange
was very rich,

666
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,620
I wanted to keep listening to it
for a long time.

667
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,330
Also, it sounded expensive,
so it's B.

668
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,000
Mr DAIGO, did you also choose B?

669
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,040
Yes, it's B.

670
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,040
You agree.
Brilliant.

671
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,290
I hope Mr Sakai is here.

672
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,790
Please be here.

673
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,290
Yes!

674
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,580
It's B, right? Thank goodness!

675
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,040
Thank goodness!

676
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,160
Good.
Naturally he would.

677
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,330
It can't be wrong.

678
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,080
We're fine, I'm sure about it now.

679
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,370
Yes.
I'm sure.

680
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,040
It has to be B.

681
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,700
Thank goodness.

682
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,870
When the new and old popular
musicians chose B,

683
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,410
what will the former firstclass
idol Nanase Nishino choose?

684
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,120
Miss Nishino.
I see...

685
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,290
Her answer is...

686
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,580
Yes. It's this.

687
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,250
She chose A!

688
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,540
She chose A.

689
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,990
"Cello A"

690
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,080
What is it? The sound was solid,

691
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:55,410
the weight sounded like
100 million yen.

692
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,450
I see.

693
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,500
Well, we don't know yet.

694
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,080
The former Nogisaka46 idol's answer

695
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,000
is the opposite
of the senior musicians.

696
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,500
Not here...

697
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,830
Nobody is here.

698
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,790
She went to A?
She went to A?

699
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,410
I'm all alone.

700
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,410
Oh, she went to A.
A...

701
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,200
It's A.
You think it's A?

702
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,000
What? I'm worried.

703
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,120
Is A or B the correct answer?

704
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,080
This is the correct answer.

705
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,790
What?

706
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,700
What?

707
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay, I'll tell everyone
at the studio the correct answer.

708
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,910
We'll see which room
the other people go in now.

709
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,250
The correct answer of the question
just now is...

710
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,910
What?

711
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,290
What?
No way!

712
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,450
What?

713
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,540
What?

714
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,750
What?

715
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,990
What?

716
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,330
I'm amazing!

717
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,580
Impressive, Ms Kaga.

718
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,540
Brilliant, Ms Kaga.

719
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,790
Really?

720
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,000
A is the correct answer.
You're a musician!

721
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,750
Really?
Amazing!

722
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,080
Hey! Hey! Hey!

723
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,580
Masaaki, hey!

724
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,330
What?

725
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,290
Just look! I'm sure he still thinks
his answer is correct.

726
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,580
Can you hear us?
Yes, I can.

727
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,750
What a pity.

728
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,080
But are you sure I lost?

729
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,250
Yes.

730
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,370
Did you know the answer?

731
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,500
A is the correct answer
and the 120 million yen cello.

732
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,910
Compared to other cellos,

733
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,500
a Giovanni Grancino has more body
and a wider range,

734
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,660
its characteristics are the depth of
the low notes and the clear sound.

735
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,870
Also, the richness in sound given
by its 300 years of history

736
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,410
is totally different.

737
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,370
Will anyone come here?

738
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,410
Miss Nishino, don't worry,
your answer is correct.

739
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,410
I thought it was B
when I listened to A.

740
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,830
That early?

741
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,450
I feel reassured.

742
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,200
The more they say,
the bigger the wound will be.

743
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,620
The "firstclass" card is removed.

744
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,660
You're "ordinary" now.

745
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,660
It changed completely
at question two.

746
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,330
He messed up.

747
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,290
Oh, it looks like this now.

748
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,080
Next, it's these two teams.

749
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,040
Here?
Yes.

750
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,500
With a career of 59 years,

751
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,120
great actor, Mr Koji Ishizaka
is also knowledgeable about art.

752
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,830
She answered the question right,

753
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,040
Yes.
please continue that.

754
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,330
If you get it wrong, I won't accept
you in "The Peaceful Town."

755
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,620
Appearing in 121 shows
only in the first half of this year,

756
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Borujuku formed less than two years
ago, but they're gaining popularity.

757
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,790
We are confident.

758
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,700
Really?

759
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:05,120
My mother had been listening
to cello since I was in her womb.

760
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,000
I think I had heard about it.

761
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,950
Really?

762
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,370
She listened to it
after she gave birth.

763
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,500
Really?

764
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,830
First, the correct answer, A.

765
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:22,910
"A: The 120 million yen
Giovanni Grancino"

766
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,830
"Pianist Eri Tanabu"

767
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,080
The cello is young.
The cello is young.

768
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,080
It sounds dry.

769
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,250
Next, the wrong answer,

770
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,410
a cello borrowed from
a music college student.

771
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:27,500
"B: Cello borrowed from
a music college student"

772
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,200
First, Mr Koji Ishizaka,
who will be expelled

773
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,120
from "The Peaceful Town"
if he doesn't choose A.

774
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,910
Okay, what will Mr Ishizaka choose?

775
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,870
Ms Kaga chose A.

776
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,120
His answer is...

777
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,250
The correct answer is...

778
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Oh!

779
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,330
Brilliant!

780
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,370
Amazing!

781
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,200
Impressive!
That's Team Bigwig for you.

782
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,330
The high notes of this cello
sounded clearer,

783
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,660
so I think this
is the 120 million cello.

784
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,250
It's easy, so stop talking.

785
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,120
Ishizaka goes to the correct room A,
where Nishino is waiting.

786
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh, I feel a bit relieved.

787
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,950
No, I'm not confident at all.

788
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,580
What? He went to A?
What?

789
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,040
The looks on their faces
are a bit weird.

790
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,620
"B: incorrect"

791
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,790
They're surprised.

792
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,120
Their faces are paler.
Yeah.

793
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,160
Can Borujuku continue
to be firstclass?

794
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,700
"Borujuku"

795
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,950
But will Anri fail them?
Anri is assertive.

796
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,200
The ladies' answers are...

797
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,990
Okay, ready, go.

798
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,990
They're different!

799
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,500
The ladies' answers are...

800
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,790
Okay, ready, go.

801
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,330
They're different!

802
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Anri, continue with B!

803
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,500
The sounds of both are heavy,

804
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,950
but the sound of B resonated

805
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
from the top of my head
to the tip of my toes.

806
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,160
I felt like I was being played.

807
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,990
You felt you were the cello.

808
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,330
Yes, the sound was similar
to my first cry.

809
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,450
What?
What?

810
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,580
It's how natural the sound was.

811
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,250
Miss Tanabe, go! Miss Tanabe, go!

812
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,290
My soul trembled
when I heard the notes, like "Gua!"

813
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,700
B's resonance was good,

814
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,450
but there was some difference
even between

815
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,330
the regular sound of Cello A.

816
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,120
What will Anri do?

817
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,910
To me,
I'm sure B resonated better,

818
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,660
but when Miss Tanabe said
her soul trembled...

819
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,700
You listen to Taro Hakase's music,
right?

820
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,450
Yes.
Isn't it a certain reason?

821
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,370
Okay, sorry, we'll choose this.

822
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,790
Thank goodness!

823
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,580
You're still firstclass.
You stood up.

824
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,620
Thank goodness!

825
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,950
Brilliant. You stay firstclass.

826
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Miss Tanabe.

827
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,580
Well done, it's correct.

828
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,990
More and more people go to Room A.

829
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,000
What?

830
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,580
Oh, thank goodness!

831
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,660
I feel relieved!

832
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,620
Thank goodness.
We outnumbered them.

833
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,990
The number.
We outnumbered them.

834
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,160
Thank goodness...

835
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,450
Are you kidding me?

836
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,950
You feel safer
if there are more people.

837
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,700
They're having fun.

838
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,250
Mr Sakai?
Yes.

839
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,290
Do you feel worried
that you two are on your own?

840
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,750
We know about music
to a certain extent,

841
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,870
we were certain that it was B
at first,

842
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,540
but now our belief is shaken.

843
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,620
But it's B.

844
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,040
B, right? It's B.
It's B.

845
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,040
I won't answer.

846
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,580
He's unusually honest.

847
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,620
Finally, it's these two teams.

848
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,790
Besides "Doctor X,"

849
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,410
leading actor Mr Masanobu Katsumura
also stars in many other big hits.

850
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,750
How about you, Mr Katsumura?
You've already got it right.

851
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,120
That's right.

852
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,200
The pressure is great.
Pressure...

853
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,540
Do your best!
Look!

854
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,450
What's that attitude?

855
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:24,910
But I have a friend in Switzerland,
who's a pro cellist.

856
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:25,910
What?

857
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,410
So...
You're used to the sound?

858
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,410
More than the others.

859
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,450
You said it.

860
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,700
Sorry, I'll take back my words.

861
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,620
14 years after his CD debut,

862
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,040
Hey! Say! JUMP's Mr Yuri Chinen
is also a presenter

863
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,080
of Gymnastics
World Championships 2021.

864
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,120
I made my debut at 13 years old
in the music industry.

865
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,040
I see.

866
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,750
I'll be okay!
You listened...

867
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,450
You need to clean up their mess too.

868
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,250
Yes, we must hang on to "ordinary."

869
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,080
See how long they can keep
the current state.

870
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:05,160
"A: The 120 million yen
Giovanni Grancino"

871
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm sure it's A. It must be.

872
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,160
You're confident.
Very confident.

873
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,580
Me too.

874
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:35,950
"B: Cello borrowed from
a music college student"

875
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,990
If it's just the two of us...

876
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,500
But I decided at first...

877
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:59,990
He isn't sure anymore.

878
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,790
First, Masanobu Katsumura, who has
a cellist friend in Switzerland.

879
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,040
"Masanobu Katsumura"

880
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,700
Kacchan has to guess this one right.

881
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,330
The answer dedicated
to his friend in Switzerland is...

882
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:18,830
B.

883
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,040
You naturally think so.

884
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,660
He failed.

885
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,410
I thought you had a friend?

886
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,540
He failed.

887
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,910
I think there was some impurity
in A.

888
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,410
Impurity?

889
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,700
There's impurity in the 120 million.

890
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:40,990
B has...

891
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,500
The sound had more depth.

892
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,910
I think.

893
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:49,830
I see.

894
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,990
His wrong answer did secondary
damage to his friend in Switzerland.

895
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,870
Thank goodness!

896
00:46:58,990 --> 00:46:59,830
Wow!

897
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,700
Thank goodness!

898
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,990
Musicians...
Musician...

899
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,200
Thank goodness!

900
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,080
You know about cello.
Yes.

901
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,250
I'm worried.
Our answers are different.

902
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,120
"Worried"

903
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,250
Why do you think it's B?

904
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,250
I thought it sounded elegant.

905
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,450
They're fist bumping.

906
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,080
Fist bump...

907
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,410
A celebration.

908
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,660
"Fist bump of victory"

909
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,580
Next, Johnny's Chinen, the only team
that was downgraded in question one.

910
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,950
"Yuri Chinen"

911
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,500
Here comes Chinen.

912
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,370
Can he show the senior's will?

913
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,200
Okay.

914
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:40,750
His answer is...

915
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,500
It's B.

916
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:49,200
"B: Cello borrowed from
a music college student"

917
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,750
Hey...

918
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,120
Hey, Johnny's!

919
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,990
The start of the high notes
was smooth,

920
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,540
I felt comfortable
when I listened to it.

921
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,990
That's good.

922
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,200
Mr Meguro and Mr Michieda...

923
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,870
Green slippers...

924
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,750
It's only question two.

925
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,450
"Secondclass"

926
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,540
Here I come.

927
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,040
Welcome.
Somehow I feel relieved.

928
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,700
Thank goodness...

929
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,700
Good...

930
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,120
They are so happy.

931
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,990
But we don't know yet.
Right, we don't know yet.

932
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,910
That's right.

933
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:37,120
The fateful announcement
of the result!

934
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,040
Here I am!

935
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,700
The room that Celeb Master enters
is the correct answer.

936
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,160
Let me open the door
of the correct answer's room!

937
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,370
I'm scared!
I'm scared.

938
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,660
He's going to open this door!

939
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,160
The correct answer is...

940
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,660
"Praying in vain"

941
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,910
Yay!

942
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,910
"A: Correct"

943
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,410
Yay!

944
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:26,500
"B: Incorrect"

945
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,500
Wow...

946
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,120
This was difficult.

947
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,120
Let's form a band together!

948
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,990
Let's form a band.

949
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,830
I was so confident I was right.

950
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,080
"Unexpected defeat"

951
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,330
I'm so happy!

952
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:53,910
Oops, now only three teams
are firstclass celebrities.

953
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,870
I wonder what will happen
in the end.

954
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,250
Okay, people who got it wrong,
come in.

955
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,580
"Entrance for wrong answer"

956
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,450
Please return to your seats.

957
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,910
Oops...

958
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
This is what an ordinary celebrity
looks like.

959
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,000
But I'm an ordinary celebrity.

960
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,040
Mr Katsumura, you'd better
get in touch with your friend.

961
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,750
I was the only one who consider him
a friend myself not him...

962
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,990
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

963
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,730
Who Is The Real Celebrity,
an autumn of food and art,

964
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,350
three hour special programme!

965
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:49,310
Our firstclass celebrities
have gathered here again.

966
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,810
The theme of this episode

967
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,060
is an autumn of food and art.

968
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,730
We've prepared various tests about

969
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,100
autumnal things like food,
music, and painting.

970
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,730
They'll distinguish the pro from
the amateur

971
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,060
in the Taiko Drum performance.

972
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,430
Wow!

973
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,720
You're in high school?

974
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,890
Yes, students from
Japan Aviation High School.

975
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,520
Wonderful.
Amazing.

976
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,600
The high school students
will compete with the pro,

977
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,310
the performance of their souls
will cause drama!

978
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,060
If they answer the questions wrong,

979
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,600
their rank will fall immediately,
till they reach the abyss

980
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,140
and disappear at the end.

981
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,350
Our next test is this.

982
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,730
"Jazz session"

983
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,140
Jazz session.

984
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,020
We prepared a jazz piece performed
with seven musical instruments,

985
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:52,730
saxophone, trumpet, trombone,
drum, piano, double bass, and flute.

986
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,810
You'll choose an answer
among A, B, and C.

987
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,020
Listen carefully.

988
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,600
The musical instruments
used in the correct answer

989
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,390
are firstclass ones
used by professionals.

990
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,850
But the other two are played with

991
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,140
only cheap musical instruments
professionals would never use.

992
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,930
For the wrong answer,

993
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:20,230
among the seven musical instruments,
four are made of plastic.

994
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:24,560
There are three professional ones
and four toy musical instruments.

995
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,810
That's right.

996
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,680
And for the option
you mustn't choose,

997
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,310
among the seven,

998
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,930
only two are musical instruments
used by professionals.

999
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,770
The rest are four plastic
musical instruments, and worse,

1000
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:42,310
the other one is someone's mouth.
That's the composition.

1001
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,730
You can't even call that music.
The mouth...

1002
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,890
Your rank will go down two if you
choose the Absolutely No answer.

1003
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,980
Be careful not to choose it.

1004
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,180
It's scary.

1005
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,180
Okay, we'll announce
the representatives.

1006
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,230
Okay, from Team Bigwig,
Ms Mariko Kaga.

1007
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,520
Okay, please do it.

1008
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,480
From Team Doctor X,
Mr Masanobu Katsumura.

1009
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,600
Okay, please do it.

1010
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,720
No...

1011
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,230
I don't want that!

1012
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,350
I just failed and it was traumatic.

1013
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:23,560
Then you must recover lost ground.
That's the love of our staff.

1014
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,980
They are the representatives.

1015
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,850
Make sure you don't choose the one
performed vocally.

1016
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,100
No!

1017
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,480
Representatives,
please go to the room.

1018
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,020
Please come here.

1019
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,680
Please come here.

1020
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,140
Thank you.

1021
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,180
Kento, you must hold out.

1022
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,430
If four of them are plastic,
then it should be rather obvious.

1023
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,850
We start from
the three ordinary celebrities

1024
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,020
who can't get another answer wrong.

1025
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,520
Kacchan goes first?

1026
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,850
The leader.
He was forced to.

1027
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,560
I feel sorry for him.

1028
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,730
He looks worried.
Traumatic...

1029
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,930
He has an air of despair.

1030
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:14,230
The same professional musicians
will perform all the pieces.

1031
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,480
You can hear it too, please listen.

1032
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,720
"Performed by professionals"

1033
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,640
First, it's A.

1034
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,720
"Musical Instruments A"

1035
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,850
Next, B.

1036
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:07,930
"Musical Instruments B"

1037
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,730
That was B.
Yes.

1038
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,020
Lastly, C.

1039
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:48,100
"Musical Instruments C"

1040
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,560
It's difficult.

1041
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,810
It is, but I know the one
performed vocally.

1042
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,770
I tried to look for one played
by a different instrument.

1043
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,720
I see.

1044
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,060
The double bass of B was
performed vocally.

1045
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,480
That was vocal?
Yes.

1046
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,730
It's A or C.
Okay.

1047
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,520
Which one?

1048
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,770
The sound of the bass...
You won't say?

1049
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,850
Please tell him.
A or C.

1050
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,480
I think it's C.
I see.

1051
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,230
Does anyone agree?

1052
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,890
But C...
Miss Nishino?

1053
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,980
You think it's C?
I thought it was C, but...

1054
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,060
I totally thought C was the one
performed vocally.

1055
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,810
C was performed vocally.

1056
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,480
Before Kacchan says it.

1057
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,230
I couldn't decide between B and C,
but I could hear various sounds

1058
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,140
that weren't uniform.

1059
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,430
I see...

1060
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,310
So I end up picking B.

1061
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,230
I see.
That's what I thought.

1062
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,140
I'm not confident at all.

1063
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,310
The problematic guy comes
right away.

1064
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,350
"Wrong answer in cello question"

1065
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,480
He comes first?

1066
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,390
Your partner said B.
Yes.

1067
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,560
His answer is...

1068
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,390
I'll go with this.

1069
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,270
What?

1070
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,020
C...

1071
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,270
Correct!

1072
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,310
I felt the confidence of using
real musical instruments.

1073
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,720
So I'll choose C.

1074
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,140
He agrees with you, Mr Masaaki.

1075
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,640
Yes.
You two think the same.

1076
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,270
"Guesses B"

1077
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,020
Masaaki and Katsumura both
got the cello question wrong,

1078
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,890
their opinions are the same again.

1079
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,730
"Waiting room C"

1080
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,980
Please...

1081
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,930
Please...

1082
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,560
Next, the junior
of Masaaki's agency.

1083
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,680
Here he comes.
He's here...

1084
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,850
Choose C!

1085
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,770
His answer is...

1086
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,020
This one.

1087
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,020
Oh?
B.

1088
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,850
I can't stand this guy.

1089
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,350
You don't know yet.
You don't know yet.

1090
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,390
He just doesn't agree with you.

1091
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:37,140
The first one sounded a bit plastic.

1092
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,060
The third one...

1093
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:44,140
I think I heard a man humming.

1094
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,350
It isn't B.

1095
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,720
Senior Masaaki insists it's C,
ignoring him, the junior chooses B.

1096
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,850
Not here...

1097
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,270
"Waiting room B"

1098
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,020
Where's Mr Katsumura? It's C...

1099
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,270
Katsunori chose B?

1100
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,850
It's divided.

1101
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,100
We did.

1102
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,390
Here I go.

1103
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:21,480
"Rock singer DAIGO
must not get this wrong!"

1104
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:25,350
But Sho Kiryuin's band
is an air rock band.

1105
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,930
Mine is an actual band.

1106
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,560
I'm going to show you
the difference.

1107
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,810
Really?
Yes.

1108
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,350
His answer is...

1109
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,520
The correct answer is...

1110
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,310
B.

1111
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,230
"Musical Instrument B"

1112
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,230
He's relaxed.

1113
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,430
This is the only option for me.

1114
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,140
The sound was very uniform.

1115
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,480
Everything was in harmony,

1116
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:56,520
but I also sensed the swing
of jazz music properly.

1117
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,060
What do you think, Kiryuin?

1118
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,850
Actually, I also thought it was B,

1119
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,730
so we agree.
You agree. I see.

1120
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:07,100
I'm jealous. It's nice when you
and your teammate agree.

1121
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,890
Yay!
You're here.

1122
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,890
The two gentlemen became animated
right away. On the other hand...

1123
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,230
"Waiting room C"

1124
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,270
No way!

1125
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,060
He's talking to himself.

1126
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:25,730
To himself...

1127
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,890
Now, we'll tell only our viewers
the correct answer.

1128
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,810
The jazz session played by
first class musical instruments is

1129
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,180
A!

1130
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:40,730
That means nobody chose
the right answer. It's outrageous!

1131
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,980
The Absolutely No session

1132
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,810
performed vocally that will
downgrade them two ranks is...

1133
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:50,560
C!

1134
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,730
Oops, he messed up again.

1135
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,100
"Two ranks down"

1136
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,720
What will the four remaining teams
choose? Let's check it out!

1137
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,270
First, the correct answer, A, with
all firstclass musical instruments.

1138
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:13,350
"A: correct answer, seven
firstclass musical instruments"

1139
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:40,600
Doesn't A's bass sound like humming?

1140
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,350
So...
A?

1141
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,850
Next, wrong answer.

1142
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:51,350
B, which four among the seven
musical instruments are plastic.

1143
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:54,600
"B: wrong answer, four are plastic"

1144
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,020
"Plastic trumpet"

1145
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,020
"Plastic saxophone"

1146
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:06,600
"Plastic trombone"

1147
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,850
"Plastic drums"

1148
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:19,480
"Firstclass: piano,
double bass, flute"

1149
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,720
Lastly, C,
which downgrades two ranks.

1150
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:33,180
In addition to
four plastic musical instruments,

1151
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:38,560
trombone is performed by Mr AFRA,
the pioneer of beatboxing.

1152
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,600
"C: Absolutely No,
plastic and vocal"

1153
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,180
"First class: piano, double bass"

1154
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,390
"Plastic: saxophone, trumpet,
drums, flute"

1155
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,680
"Vocal: trombone"

1156
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:15,640
You must not choose C!

1157
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,560
First, Sakurazaka46, the top idols
who performed on Kohaku Uta Gassen.

1158
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:23,390
They won't be the same.

1159
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,430
No.

1160
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,980
It was also divided just now.

1161
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,680
The answers
of the three ladies are...

1162
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,640
Oh!

1163
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,980
Amazing! All of them are correct.

1164
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,730
What?

1165
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,060
They're the same.
What will happen?

1166
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,020
Wow!
It's unusual they're all the same.

1167
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:49,640
I think it was the most uniform.

1168
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,520
The sound of the drums of B
was a bit too loud,

1169
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,390
and I couldn't hear the other
musical instruments clearly.

1170
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,930
I couldn't choose between A and C,

1171
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,850
but A was easier to listen to.

1172
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,020
If they all think the same...

1173
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,310
It must feel good.

1174
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,720
It's reassuring.

1175
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,890
Mr Akimoto,
Sakurazaka46's stock is soaring!

1176
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,390
Please...

1177
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,520
Nobody!

1178
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,140
"A: correct"

1179
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,850
No!
No!

1180
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:24,980
They messed up.

1181
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,640
"Wrong but confident"

1182
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,810
They messed up.

1183
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:33,640
No reaction from him, maybe because
he's sure he is wrong.

1184
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,560
"He is sure he lost?"

1185
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,980
Now I feel really sorry for Kacchan.

1186
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,060
"People at the studio
don't know the correct answer"

1187
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,890
Next, Ms Mariko Kaga, who performed
remarkably well today.

1188
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,350
"Mariko Kaga"

1189
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,810
I'm counting on you...

1190
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,520
What will Ms Kaga choose?

1191
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,640
Yeah...

1192
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,060
What is the answer
everyone wants to know?

1193
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,350
First, it isn't A.

1194
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,480
Oops! She got rid of
the correct answer right away!

1195
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:06,730
It was easy to hear the sound of
all the musical instruments of B.

1196
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,730
It was too good
and it bothers me somehow.

1197
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:13,600
She does it with doubts.

1198
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,430
So I'll choose C this time.

1199
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,850
Are you serious?

1200
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,480
I think he's going to be delighted.

1201
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,560
He got the best ally.

1202
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,230
She got rid of
the correct answer first,

1203
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,640
and chose the one that will do
more damage to confidence.

1204
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:33,730
Wow!

1205
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,680
Thank goodness!

1206
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:35,730
Thank you!

1207
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,980
It's C.

1208
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,810
It's C, right?
Yeah.

1209
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:40,810
B was too beautiful.

1210
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:41,890
Right?
Yes.

1211
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,680
That's why I chose C.

1212
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,730
They try to convince themselves
somehow,

1213
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,730
and they're saying various things
in their minds.

1214
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,770
Please! I hope C is correct.

1215
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,930
"Correct but worried"

1216
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,930
What?

1217
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,720
Maybe the girls don't sing
to live music often?

1218
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,560
Occasionally...
Usually karaoke?

1219
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,560
It really is occasionally...
Yeah.

1220
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,060
It didn't feel like jazz.

1221
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,390
Girls at their age
don't listen to jazz.

1222
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,310
No.

1223
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,100
A is correct, but the girls
are made a fool of.

1224
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,810
Hold out a bit longer!

1225
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,850
This time, the young people
are all excellent.

1226
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:24,390
Mr Kento Nagayama can stay
firstclass if he answers A.

1227
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,930
He needs to hold on now.

1228
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,100
Which one will Mr Kento raise?

1229
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,020
His answer is...

1230
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,140
A.

1231
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,810
Oh!

1232
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,020
Firstclass,
chosen by firstclass...

1233
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,930
A?

1234
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,430
C has to be wrong.

1235
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,730
I think I heard the sound
of a vocal performance.

1236
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,850
B is...

1237
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:57,430
The sound of the trumpet or
something bothered me at a place.

1238
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,640
It's quite equally divided.

1239
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,680
It's divided.

1240
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,850
It's divided.

1241
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,100
Mr Kento Nagayama successfully
stays firstclass!

1242
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,430
Oh!

1243
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,310
He was a bit disgusted.

1244
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,600
He was a bit disgusted
because they were young.

1245
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,890
Come on!
Ms Kaga isn't here.

1246
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,390
No, she isn't. She chose C.

1247
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,810
Kento, it's wrong!

1248
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,020
A is young.

1249
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,310
They're young.
I liked the sound.

1250
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,770
They're still a bit...

1251
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,680
It's close to the age of toys.

1252
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,020
I guess jazz is too soon for them.

1253
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:41,480
Now we want to see
all the young people get it right!

1254
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,770
I'm counting on you!
Chinen, it's now.

1255
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:48,640
It depends on where they'll go now.

1256
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:51,720
They'll be correct if they say A.

1257
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,810
Ready, go.

1258
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,140
We chose differently again.
Yeah.

1259
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,480
It's divided.
Divided.

1260
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:09,020
It was the power of A and I was
carried away by the music,

1261
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:11,850
so I choose A.

1262
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,020
I just got the first answer wrong,

1263
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,430
so I'm not confident.
Yeah.

1264
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,100
But they're different questions!

1265
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,020
What will they choose?

1266
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,930
We'll choose A, then.
Okay.

1267
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:28,810
A.
Yes.

1268
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,810
Chinen, is A okay?

1269
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,480
I wanted to choose B.

1270
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,060
Meguro didn't compromise...

1271
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,180
He didn't.

1272
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,930
Johnny's would've failed
if Chinen had answered.

1273
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,730
They barely hung in there.

1274
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:43,770
Please!

1275
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,060
Mr Nagayama, the other young guys
are coming.

1276
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:48,720
Please be there.

1277
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:51,730
"Pay attention"

1278
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,140
No!

1279
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,020
He held his head.

1280
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,430
Did he look down?

1281
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:58,930
A...

1282
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,480
It's A.

1283
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,680
We actually saw nobody just now.

1284
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,930
All the young people are at A.

1285
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,180
Yeah.

1286
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,270
A is the sound for children.

1287
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,350
The fateful announcement
of the result!

1288
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:17,060
Here I am!

1289
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,100
Please!

1290
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:30,180
I'll start from opening the door of
the room that downgrades one rank.

1291
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,270
I'm happy with just one!
One down...

1292
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,520
Let's do it.

1293
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,560
"A: Correct"

1294
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,600
"B: Wrong"

1295
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,270
"C: Absolutely No"

1296
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,180
Oh?

1297
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:52,560
What?

1298
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,350
Are you serious?

1299
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,020
Oh no! I'm scared...

1300
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,180
I don't know...

1301
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,680
Oh, please!
It could be two ranks down!

1302
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:06,600
I knew it. We're right.
We did it.

1303
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,730
Oh, thank goodness! I'm so happy.

1304
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,310
"Strangely confident"

1305
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,850
That means this isn't correct.

1306
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,430
There were toys?

1307
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,680
I knew it wasn't B.

1308
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:21,350
I'll go open the door of
the correct one. Please be patient.

1309
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,310
Please!
Which one? Please!

1310
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,560
Not two ranks down!

1311
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,020
We don't want to go down two ranks.

1312
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,020
It's awful.

1313
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,720
If I don't open the door of
your room, you go down two ranks.

1314
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,230
Here I go.

1315
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,980
"A: Correct"

1316
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,310
Open it! Okay! Come here!

1317
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:54,480
Congratulations!

1318
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,390
We did it!

1319
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:01,680
We did it!

1320
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,980
Thank you.

1321
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,930
Congratulations!

1322
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,100
We did it!

1323
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:09,730
Thank goodness!

1324
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,720
Well...

1325
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:19,720
"Boom"

1326
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,390
That's correct?

1327
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,720
Oh!

1328
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:25,680
Nice!

1329
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,850
They were right?

1330
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,140
He got it right.

1331
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,230
C is the unexpected answer
that brings you down two ranks.

1332
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:34,560
The young people...

1333
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,770
So the two people in Room C

1334
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,730
will go down two ranks!

1335
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,100
Oh no!

1336
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,560
No!

1337
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,850
What's this?

1338
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,770
Slippers for the toilet.

1339
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,310
They feel so uncomfortable!

1340
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,310
Okay, the people who answered it
correctly are back.

1341
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:03,810
Congratulations! Well done. Amazing!

1342
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,140
It was brilliant.

1343
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,430
People who got it wrong, come in.

1344
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,850
"Entrance for wrong answer"

1345
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,770
I was so sure it was B.

1346
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:20,600
Ms Kaga...

1347
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,140
Ms Kaga...
That had to be C.

1348
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,430
Oops.

1349
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:35,060
Look at that.
Yes.

1350
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:36,810
Her legs are spread wide.

1351
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,980
We've done the third question,

1352
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,890
most of you are secondclass.

1353
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,810
The team here is thirdclass.

1354
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,810
He went down three ranks by himself.

1355
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,930
After three questions,
only two teams stay firstclass.

1356
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,020
After this, a serious incident
will make you doubt your eyes.

1357
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,230
The next test is this.

1358
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,720
"Taiko drums"

1359
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,390
Taiko drums.

1360
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:10,720
In the season of music,
the fourth test

1361
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:13,850
is a performance of the soul music
of Japanese people

1362
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,810
with Taiko drums
that appeared in myths.

1363
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,480
Compare the performance
by professionals

1364
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,100
and high school students,

1365
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,350
and guess which one
is performed by professionals.

1366
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,520
First, the professionals
of the correct answer

1367
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,430
is Japan's famous
Kodo Taiko Performing Arts Ensemble.

1368
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,850
They've done over 6,500 performances
in 52 countries in the world.

1369
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:38,390
The wrong answer is fourtimes
champion in a national tournament,

1370
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,770
a prestigious school of Taiko drums
with brilliant achievements,

1371
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,180
Yamanashi Prefecture's Japan
Aviation High School's Taiko Band.

1372
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:49,270
Actually, their baseball team
played at Koshien this summer,

1373
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,140
and they used Taiko drums
to cheer for them on the Alps Stand.

1374
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,810
That's right.

1375
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,060
Some people have gone down a lot.

1376
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,850
If the secondclass celebs
aren't careful,

1377
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,930
you're going to disappear.

1378
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,980
Where did you buy these slippers?

1379
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,560
That's...

1380
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,930
If you say that, look at theirs.

1381
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,430
The top and the bottom
are so unbalanced.

1382
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,180
Indeed.

1383
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,600
Okay, we announce
the representatives.

1384
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,390
One representative will do the test.

1385
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,600
From Team The Words They Speak,
Miss Nanase Nishino.

1386
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,730
Please do it.

1387
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,890
From Team K Dash,
Masaaki Sakaikun.

1388
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,180
Okay, please do it.

1389
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:37,020
I haven't been called "kun"
in a long time!

1390
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:41,680
From Team Doctor X, Ryoko Yonekura.

1391
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,230
Okay, please do it.

1392
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:47,720
They're thirdclass.
They're thirdclass.

1393
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,310
I'll do my best.

1394
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:53,390
The other representatives
are as shown.

1395
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,560
Team Doctor X, if you fail again,
you'll be in trouble.

1396
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:00,520
Representatives, please go
to the room for your test.

1397
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,230
Please come here.

1398
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,520
I'm content with being secondclass.

1399
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,560
It's a bit...

1400
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,020
Now is where they should hold on,
especially the firstclass ones.

1401
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,350
First, it's thirdclass
celebrity Yonekura

1402
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:18,640
and secondclass celebrities
Masaaki, Kiryuin.

1403
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,060
The three teams at the edge
of a cliff, it's time!

1404
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:27,850
You're both musicians, but you got
everything wrong. What's that?

1405
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:30,560
We do more variety shows.

1406
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,520
Among musicians.

1407
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,730
Yeah, actually.

1408
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,480
I'll get it right this time
and show you I'm a musician.

1409
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,560
That's right.

1410
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,810
And you?
Sakaikun.

1411
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,810
I'll get it this time.

1412
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,930
Yeah.

1413
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,810
I won't forget about the cello!

1414
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,730
You got the question
your teammate got wrong too!

1415
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,520
I thought it was C.

1416
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,600
That was close. So close.

1417
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,680
You...

1418
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,730
You need to hold on now.

1419
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,230
Don't give me that.

1420
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,140
I'll listen with my heart.
Right?

1421
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:06,600
Wait, which one matters more?
My heart or my skills?

1422
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,100
Both?
Did You really ask him?

1423
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,680
Yeah, I asked the wrong person.

1424
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,270
Wrong person?
Yeah.

1425
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,720
Which one is the professional's
Taiko performance?

1426
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:18,390
Please think together with them.

1427
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,810
First, Taiko drums A.

1428
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:28,890
"Taiko drums A"

1429
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,930
That was A.
Yes.

1430
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:43,770
Next, Taiko drums B.

1431
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:50,850
"Taiko drums B"

1432
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,980
That was B.

1433
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,390
Is anyone confident?

1434
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,770
Is it A or B?
What do you think, Mr DAIGO?

1435
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,850
I think it's A.

1436
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:10,980
Why is that?

1437
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:14,390
I sensed that A was played
in a more technical way.

1438
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,390
Oh.

1439
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,430
Kacchan.

1440
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,270
A, I think.

1441
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,640
A sounded heavier.

1442
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,560
I felt the power of adults.
I see.

1443
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:27,890
I also think it's A.

1444
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:29,640
How about you guys?

1445
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,720
I also think it's A.

1446
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,060
I thought it was B.
That's okay.

1447
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:36,640
And you, Sakurazaka?

1448
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,770
Two of us think it's B,
and she thinks it's A.

1449
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,270
B and A.
Yes.

1450
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:42,600
Ms Kaga, and you?

1451
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,350
It has to be A, I think.

1452
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,230
It's A, if you must say?
Yeah.

1453
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,310
When the opinions at the studio
are divided,

1454
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:55,810
Masaaki Sakai, who got the cello
question wrong, is here first.

1455
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,180
"Masaaki Sakai"

1456
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,430
What will Masaaki choose?

1457
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:03,680
His answer is...

1458
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,480
The performance of
experienced drummers is...

1459
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:10,140
Taiko drums A. I'm sure.
I see.

1460
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:12,930
"Guesses A"

1461
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,430
You don't use ears to listen to
Taiko drums, you use your heart.

1462
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:20,430
He said it.

1463
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,140
Guys, come here.

1464
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,640
"Waiting room A"

1465
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,720
I'm waiting here.

1466
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:28,680
I'll make it warm for you.

1467
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,980
Will he get it right this time?

1468
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,180
Next, the one who also got
the cello question wrong,

1469
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,730
secondclass musician, Sho Kiryuin.

1470
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,600
Here Kiryuin comes.
I'm counting on you.

1471
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,020
He'll decide whether
you'll be downgraded or not.

1472
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:47,520
His answer is...

1473
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,480
It's A.

1474
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,060
"Guesses A"

1475
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,350
Both performances
were powerful and great,

1476
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,680
but if I have to find fault,

1477
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:05,100
in B, the part where the drumming
gradually got more powerful,

1478
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:08,980
the attack wasn't uniform
and it was obvious.

1479
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,730
I see.

1480
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:14,980
Mr Masaaki must feel relieved now,
if someone else goes there.

1481
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,810
"Feels relieved"

1482
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,180
The two people who got
all the answers wrong today chose A.

1483
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:23,060
Wait, is this okay? Is it?

1484
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,180
Here you are!

1485
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:28,640
Mr Sakai!

1486
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,560
It's the same pattern as last time.

1487
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,270
No, we'll get this one right.

1488
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,850
Yes, this time we'll get it right!
This time...

1489
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,770
They got the last one wrong.

1490
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:44,480
In Room B.
Yeah.

1491
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,140
In Room B...

1492
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:48,350
Yeah, the same two people.

1493
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:52,100
Next, if she gets this wrong,
she'll become a lookalike.

1494
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,930
Team Doctor X's Ryoko Yonekura.

1495
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:56,520
Excuse me.

1496
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,640
Really, she must hold on now.

1497
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,520
Her answer is...

1498
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,980
My answer is...

1499
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,310
A.

1500
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,100
Reason, it's the reason.

1501
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,100
Reason...

1502
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,230
It was mellow, powerful, and heavy.

1503
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,060
What is it?

1504
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,680
Like, I'm glad I came here today.

1505
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,310
She said something nice.

1506
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:34,310
But they all...
Yeah, they're in the same room.

1507
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:38,310
Now, it's three A's in a row.

1508
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,390
Oh!

1509
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,390
Yay!

1510
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,640
Thank goodness...

1511
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:52,140
When I listened to it,
I was on the verge of tears.

1512
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,310
Oh...

1513
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:56,560
It was amazing...

1514
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,930
Amazing! All three of us are here.

1515
01:22:59,020 --> 01:22:59,980
I'm happy!

1516
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,680
Isn't this obvious, then?

1517
01:23:02,730 --> 01:23:05,310
Nothing can be more powerful!

1518
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:06,520
Yes.

1519
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:10,730
Next, it's the two
secondclass celebrities here.

1520
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,810
Okay...
They're really difficult to walk in.

1521
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,730
What do you think? Taiko drums...
I wonder...

1522
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,560
The high school students
are also good.

1523
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,890
I think so.

1524
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,640
I think it'll be very difficult.
I see.

1525
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,140
Who in your team will go?

1526
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:25,270
I'll go.
Chinen.

1527
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:26,230
What about you?

1528
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:29,980
I had played Taiko drum
in one of my performances,

1529
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,430
thousands of people listened to it.

1530
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,730
I can do it.
You said it!

1531
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:35,770
Okay.

1532
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:40,640
Chinen has experience in Taiko
drums, this question must be easy.

1533
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,680
"Experienced in Taiko"

1534
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:46,560
Which one will he choose?

1535
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,060
We'll win straightforwardly.

1536
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:53,230
They can announce the correct answer
is A now.

1537
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,730
Yeah.
I can't afford to lose again.

1538
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,020
"Thirdclass"

1539
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,730
That's very unbalanced.
Yes.

1540
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,520
Yuri Chinen, the only guy
who knows Taiko drums.

1541
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,640
His answer will change
the situation.

1542
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:10,140
Chinen, now...

1543
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,270
The answer
everyone wants to know is...

1544
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:16,020
It's B.

1545
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:17,350
It's divided!

1546
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,520
It's divided.

1547
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:25,850
The strength of each part...

1548
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:31,270
You can hear the part played
by small Taiko drums. It's obvious.

1549
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:34,140
I see.
It was easy to listen to.

1550
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,640
So it's B.

1551
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,310
I think it's right.

1552
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,980
I see.

1553
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,680
One goes to Room B.

1554
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,180
"Experienced in Taiko drums"

1555
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:48,350
Chinen, who has experience
in Taiko drums,

1556
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:50,180
goes to an empty Room B.

1557
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:54,310
The people in A were confident,
but it doesn't look favourable now.

1558
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,600
What?

1559
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,680
Whoa, are you kidding me?

1560
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,680
What? He went to B?
What?

1561
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:04,100
What?

1562
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,930
Are you kidding me?

1563
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,140
Oh, three people there!

1564
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,850
Chinen?
But he said he played Taiko drums.

1565
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:15,930
Yes, I played Taiko. I did...
Really?

1566
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,390
I have experience!

1567
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:19,680
B?

1568
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:24,270
Next, Team Bigwig, Koji Ishizaka.

1569
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,310
Kaga at the studio guessed A.

1570
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:31,230
Mr Ishizaka, you'll get it, right?
Yes.

1571
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,520
His answer is...

1572
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,810
It's B.

1573
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,520
"Guesses A"

1574
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:48,730
The bass of both had the power
that typical Taiko drums have,

1575
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:53,060
I think it's the timing
that cuts in,

1576
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:58,980
is where the difference between
the pro and the precision

1577
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:02,390
of students executing
what they learnt.

1578
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,020
So I think it's B.

1579
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:06,560
"Unhappy"

1580
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,770
Now it's three versus two.
It is hard to tell!

1581
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,390
Oh!
Oh?

1582
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,180
Thank goodness!

1583
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:18,980
It's B, right?
I think so.

1584
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,890
What?
Mr Ishizaka...

1585
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,350
Mr Ishizaka and I are incompatible.

1586
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:30,310
But many of the people
in A are hopeless.

1587
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,520
Wait...

1588
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,850
Don't say that.

1589
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,770
Indeed.

1590
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,640
Is the correct answer A or B?

1591
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:41,520
I'll tell everyone at the studio
the correct answer now.

1592
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,810
Which one?

1593
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:45,980
Let's go. Taiko drums,
the correct answer is...

1594
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,810
A.

1595
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:52,270
"Correct answer: A"

1596
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,680
Oh no.

1597
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:55,850
Well...

1598
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,730
What will happen to me?

1599
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,180
Well...

1600
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:04,100
Did you know the answer?
A is the correct answer.

1601
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,230
They're professional Taiko
Performing Arts Ensemble, Kodo.

1602
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:09,720
My belly can feel it.

1603
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,810
Well done, the three of them
got it right.

1604
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,850
"A: Correct"

1605
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:18,430
A sounds textbooklike here.

1606
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,810
The part it does a crescendo.

1607
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,140
He's talking.

1608
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,730
He's wrong, but he's talking.

1609
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:25,930
Right?

1610
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,890
It's the most embarrassing.

1611
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:31,230
Oh my God!

1612
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,020
So Johnny's and Bigwig
both go, "Oh my God!"

1613
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,640
The treatment is different.

1614
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,430
Wow...

1615
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,390
I like this.

1616
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:44,850
Wow, how did you find these?

1617
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:48,890
Lastly, it's the two teams
of firstclass celebrities.

1618
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,180
First, the correct answer, A.

1619
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:58,640
"A: Correct. Kodo Taiko
Performing Arts Ensemble"

1620
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:23,060
I think the performance of
the students was amazing too.

1621
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,100
We, Kodo, don't play
only with power,

1622
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:42,640
we play each note properly,

1623
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:47,720
bearing in mind to bring out
the rich sound of Taiko drums.

1624
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:06,600
This is the correct answer, A.

1625
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:08,430
Yes, the professionals.

1626
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,770
Now, a performance
by high school students,

1627
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:14,680
which made two teams wrongly think
they were professionals.

1628
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:21,770
"B: Wrong. Japan Aviation
High School Taiko Band"

1629
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,060
This is wonderful too.

1630
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,430
Right? B is wonderful too.

1631
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,480
I hope he'll come here.

1632
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,640
That's right, everyone,
this is the correct answer.

1633
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,850
First, it's firstclass celebrity,

1634
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:45,430
from Team The Words They Speak,
Miss Nanase Nishino.

1635
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,730
Here she is!

1636
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:50,390
What will she choose?
Can she stay firstclass?

1637
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,350
You'll stay firstclass
if you choose A.

1638
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:58,720
B.

1639
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,850
Oh!

1640
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:01,850
"B: Japan Aviation High School"

1641
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:04,600
She couldn't stay firstclass.

1642
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,930
The more you think...

1643
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,720
Actually,
both of them were powerful,

1644
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,770
there wasn't a great difference,

1645
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:15,770
but I'll choose B.

1646
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,060
The high school students are happy.

1647
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,770
I think they're happy.

1648
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,140
Right?
It's a fantastic memory.

1649
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:28,680
More and more people
go to the wrong answer, B.

1650
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,020
Oh, thank goodness!

1651
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,730
Good...

1652
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,140
We've got more friends.

1653
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,230
Thank goodness.

1654
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,390
Yikes, yikes, yikes...

1655
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,270
We don't know yet.

1656
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:46,560
It's three to three now.

1657
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,230
Yes, it's exactly half and half.

1658
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:55,980
Lastly, the only firstclass
celebrities left, Borujuku.

1659
01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:57,850
Borujuku is here.

1660
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,720
Please...

1661
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:02,720
Now is when you must hold on.

1662
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,060
It's A...

1663
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:07,720
Will they choose A
and stay firstclass?

1664
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:09,520
Ready, go.

1665
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:11,430
Oh, it's divided!

1666
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,480
It's divided again.

1667
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,020
It's divided.

1668
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:22,140
I think the strength was played
more elaborately in A.

1669
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:24,350
I know what you mean, I do,

1670
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:26,600
but I think
it's because they're young.

1671
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,180
No...

1672
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,270
No. That's fine...

1673
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,430
Choose A!

1674
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,140
Sure, A's performance shook my soul.

1675
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:36,640
And my heart danced too.

1676
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,930
But this has a longer history.
And weight.

1677
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,770
They keep persuading her.

1678
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:44,270
Hang in there!

1679
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,680
I'm confident.

1680
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:47,640
I think it's this one.

1681
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:49,680
Rock, paper, scissors.
No. It's the weight.

1682
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,020
Yes, the weight.
B? I'll choose B, then.

1683
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,230
Now all the firstclass celebrities
are gone!

1684
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,720
It's the majority.

1685
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:58,270
It can't be helped.

1686
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,060
It's okay, the weight is...

1687
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:03,480
Oh! There isn't
any firstclass celebrity left.

1688
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:05,140
Okay?
Yeah.

1689
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:09,100
"Sure they are right"

1690
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:13,180
Thank goodness...

1691
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,930
Whoa...

1692
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:18,890
"Correct, but worried"

1693
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:20,930
Those in A are feeling down.

1694
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,020
That's unexpected.

1695
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:28,640
The two firstclass teams
are there...

1696
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:33,140
The fateful announcement
of the result!

1697
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:36,390
Here I am!

1698
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,390
"Celeb Master enters the room
of the correct answer"

1699
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,720
Please!
Please come here!

1700
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:44,270
I'm going to open the door
of the correct room!

1701
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:46,730
The correct answer is...

1702
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,480
"A: Correct"

1703
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,520
"B: Wrong"

1704
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,930
Congratulations!

1705
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,100
Yay!

1706
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,680
Yes!

1707
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,480
Yes!

1708
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:07,430
Congratulations!

1709
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:10,850
Yay! Yay!

1710
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,020
Yes!

1711
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,430
"B: Wrong"

1712
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:20,720
She's right.
Gosh! I was right!

1713
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:21,980
She was right.

1714
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,060
How about this?

1715
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,310
Oh, I'm crying!

1716
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,020
Yeah, A was powerful.

1717
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,720
I was on the verge of tears!

1718
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:36,140
Thank goodness!
Wow...

1719
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:37,600
Both firstclass teams got it wrong.

1720
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,560
Oh, what a pity.

1721
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,480
Right?

1722
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,720
I'm so angry at myself!

1723
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:43,890
It's frustrating.

1724
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,430
It's so frustrating!

1725
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:49,560
People who answered correctly
are back.

1726
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,230
Wonderful! Well done!

1727
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:59,100
They entered the studio with their
heads held high. Congratulations.

1728
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,720
Yay!
You were nervous at last, right?

1729
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,020
It was amazing.

1730
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,230
Yay!

1731
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:08,390
They answered it correctly.

1732
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,810
Now, the people who got it wrong
are back.

1733
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:15,560
"Entrance for wrong answer"

1734
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,350
What a pity!

1735
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,680
It's frustrating!

1736
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:21,230
Here they are...

1737
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:24,810
They're apple boxes.

1738
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:27,770
It's so frustrating...

1739
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:33,310
Everyone, there is no
firstclass celebrity left.

1740
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:37,390
All are gone after this.
It's "ordinary celebs" at the top.

1741
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,770
But you must stay here now.

1742
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,390
Yeah...

1743
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,140
The thirdclass and secondclass
teams only have two questions left,

1744
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:48,060
so it's quite possible that
you'll disappear at the end.

1745
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:48,980
Yes.

1746
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,140
I see.
Yes.

1747
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:55,140
Oh dear! Now we have three teams
of thirdclass celebrities.

1748
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:58,600
Maybe most will disappear
after the two remaining questions.

1749
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:03,220
Who Is the Real Celebrity,
an autumn of food and art,

1750
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:06,840
three-hour special programme!

1751
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:13,800
Our first-class celebrities
have gathered here again.

1752
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:17,300
The theme of this episode

1753
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,550
is an autumn of food and art.

1754
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:24,220
We've prepared various tests about

1755
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,590
autumnal things like food,
music, and painting.

1756
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,220
They'll distinguish
the pro from the amateur

1757
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,550
in the Taiko Drum performance.

1758
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,920
Wow!

1759
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,210
You're in high school?

1760
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,380
Yes, students from
Japan Aviation High School.

1761
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,010
- Wonderful.
- Amazing.

1762
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,090
The high school students
will compete with the pro.

1763
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:49,800
The performance of their souls
will cause drama!

1764
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:55,550
If they answer the questions wrong,

1765
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:59,090
their rank falls immediately
till they reach the abyss

1766
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:01,510
and disappear at the end.

1767
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,840
The next test is this.

1768
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,050
Painting.

1769
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:08,800
What? Painting?

1770
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:12,300
Painting is a must
in the season of art.

1771
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,550
That's right.

1772
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:17,670
There will be portrait paintings

1773
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,920
and portrait photos.

1774
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:23,090
You'll compare the two
and guess which group is paintings.

1775
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,720
- Yes, one group is photos.
- Yes.

1776
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,170
But this time,
we made it easy for you.

1777
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,670
You won't be comparing just one

1778
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:34,260
but three paintings
and three photos.

1779
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,420
Just choose
which group is paintings.

1780
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,920
That's all. That's right.

1781
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:39,920
We'll know.

1782
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:42,720
Mr Ishizaka said it was unbelievable

1783
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,130
and they're difficult to tell apart.
He gave us pressure.

1784
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,760
Realistic paintings are popular now.

1785
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,340
- What?
- Realistic ones are popular.

1786
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,300
You're already making an excuse?

1787
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,470
Get your act together!

1788
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,670
You said that, but you dropped
two ranks at once.

1789
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,670
Just go!

1790
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,760
You finished?

1791
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:06,010
Well...

1792
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,880
- Representatives, please.
- I'll announce.

1793
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:11,720
Team The Words They Speak,
Mr Kento Nagayama.

1794
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,670
Please do it.

1795
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:16,130
Team Bigwig, Koji Ishizaka.

1796
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:18,470
- Yes, please do it.
- It's me again?

1797
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,920
Team Doctor X, Katsumura.

1798
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:24,220
Yes, please do it.

1799
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,210
These are the representatives.

1800
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:30,170
Compare portrait paintings
and portrait photos.

1801
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,800
Choose the group of paintings.
That's all.

1802
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,130
Okay, Mr DAIGO.

1803
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:40,470
Really, if I don't hold on now...

1804
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,470
My wife is also involved, so...

1805
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,220
- Do your best, really.
- Yeah.

1806
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:49,800
Or people will say her husband
is second- or third-class.

1807
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,170
That's true...

1808
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,880
Okay, here. Katsunori.

1809
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:57,510
Well, regarding paintings,
nobody does it worse than Katsunori.

1810
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,760
He's the worst?

1811
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,760
But it's paintings or photos.

1812
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:04,670
Well, he just got one question right

1813
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,630
- and kept our rank here.
- That's right.

1814
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,210
So he told me to do my best.

1815
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:11,210
Please do your best.

1816
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:13,010
And you'll go, Kacchan.

1817
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,380
Seems I will.

1818
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:17,130
What are you going to do?
She got the last one right.

1819
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:18,220
Yeah.

1820
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,260
You know, my eyesight
is getting worse...

1821
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,970
Your voice is too soft!

1822
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,420
I know that.

1823
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:26,510
He said he'd lend me
his reading glasses.

1824
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,510
What's that conversation?

1825
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,340
Representatives, please go
to the room for the test.

1826
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:41,760
Compare the photos and paintings
and choose the paintings.

1827
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,880
It's photos and paintings!

1828
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:44,210
- It's easy.
- Easy.

1829
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:49,550
There are three portrait paintings
and three portrait photos each.

1830
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:53,090
They have 10 seconds to look at each
one. This question is very easy.

1831
01:39:55,510 --> 01:40:00,260
First, it's the hopeless three teams
of third- and second-class celebs.

1832
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:07,050
Okay, everyone.

1833
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,470
They'll compare the two groups
like this.

1834
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,970
Now, first one of group A, open.

1835
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:23,720
"Which group is painting? A or B"

1836
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:27,670
It's painting.

1837
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:33,010
Next, first one in B, open.

1838
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:34,210
Next, it's B.

1839
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,880
It isn't the same person?

1840
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:41,720
This is difficult.

1841
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:46,880
Okay, let's keep going.
Second one in A, open!

1842
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:53,380
I can't tell!

1843
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,170
Second one in B, open!

1844
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:12,050
Both groups look like paintings.

1845
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:16,670
Third one in A, open!

1846
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:18,920
Why me?

1847
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:26,300
He is smiling happily.

1848
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,720
A lovely smile.

1849
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:32,760
Well then, lastly,
third one in B, open!

1850
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:39,260
I don't know...

1851
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:49,590
It must be easy
after looking at them for so long.

1852
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:52,720
What?

1853
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:55,970
I can't tell.

1854
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:57,800
It's difficult!

1855
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:01,260
After looking at them,
please choose the paintings.

1856
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:05,380
- Yes, choose the paintings.
- Not the photos.

1857
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,920
I do think it's difficult.

1858
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:12,220
First, going down three ranks alone,

1859
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:15,170
third-class celebrity
Masanobu Katsumura.

1860
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,220
Okay, here he comes!

1861
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,590
He's here.

1862
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:24,340
If he gets it wrong,
they'll be lookalikes at once.

1863
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:29,260
I'll choose B.

1864
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,970
I see. B.

1865
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:36,050
It was very difficult to see.

1866
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:39,380
My eyesight makes it worse.
The battle was tough.

1867
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:47,630
But the eyes of the baby girl
in the middle of group B

1868
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:50,380
were very bright.

1869
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:57,630
I think they were made to look
like eyes in a photo.

1870
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,260
I see.

1871
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:02,800
If I get this one wrong,

1872
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:05,260
Ms Yonekura probably won't ever talk
to me again.

1873
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:10,800
"Got all wrong today"

1874
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:15,210
The guy who got all the answers
wrong and spoke weakly chose B.

1875
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:18,760
"Waiting room B"

1876
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,340
B. B.

1877
01:43:22,010 --> 01:43:23,970
I can't afford to get this wrong.

1878
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:28,920
Will this plague gain more friends?

1879
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:34,170
When you think about your teammate,
you would think

1880
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,340
- you mustn't fail.
- Is that so?

1881
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,970
Yeah, on the day
you become third-class.

1882
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,380
It's tense over here!

1883
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,970
How could he get
the Taiko drum question wrong?

1884
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,210
Next, it's Koji Ishizaka,
who'd seen appraisals

1885
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:01,300
of many works of art over the years.

1886
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:02,550
"Will be told off if it's wrong"

1887
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:05,920
Now, we'll see which one
Mr Ishizaka chooses.

1888
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:09,050
But I heard he paints every day.

1889
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,130
I see.

1890
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,920
He'll know.

1891
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:14,880
His answer is...

1892
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:16,340
Well, yes.

1893
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,510
Okay, I'll just go with this.

1894
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:22,800
Good.

1895
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,050
It's okay. Thank goodness.
He didn't go senile.

1896
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:32,590
The eyes of all three were the same.

1897
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:34,300
I mean group B.

1898
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:40,340
This is the way to draw
realistic eyes,

1899
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:45,300
their styles are uniform, and I
think photos wouldn't be so uniform.

1900
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,970
- I see.
- It's difficult.

1901
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:49,840
Both gentlemen chose B.

1902
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:52,970
Not yet?

1903
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:58,760
Your third-class friend
will join you soon.

1904
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:04,090
- Wow!
- There you are.

1905
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:05,420
Thank goodness!

1906
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:09,090
Thank goodness.
It's only you and me now, right?

1907
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,300
Yes.

1908
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,470
He looks happy when someone comes.

1909
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:16,050
Be quiet...

1910
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,380
Looks like a rescue squad has come.

1911
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,210
You're with the plague who got
all the questions wrong today.

1912
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:24,220
Is it okay?

1913
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,760
"Got all questions wrong"

1914
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,210
Next, it's second-class celebrity
Katsunori Takahashi.

1915
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:34,340
You can't downgrade
your senior Masaaki Sakai again.

1916
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,470
"Katsunori Takahashi'

1917
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:37,590
Here he comes.

1918
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:40,130
Katsunori, I'm counting on you.

1919
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,210
The former handsome man.

1920
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,920
His answer is...

1921
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,760
This one?

1922
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,010
Oh!

1923
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:57,550
- Katsunori chose A.
- Oh, no.

1924
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,920
That's hopeless.

1925
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:02,260
The Mr Hamada in A...

1926
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:07,300
It has a depth
at an unbelievable angle.

1927
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:12,380
I thought maybe the proportion
was changed when it was painted.

1928
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:21,550
I think the Mr Hamada in group B
looks younger, but even so...

1929
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:27,670
does he show such a casual facial
expression in front of people?

1930
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,550
- Is he teasing me?
- Yeah.

1931
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:33,260
Maybe.

1932
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,590
But I think it's A.

1933
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:39,880
Katsunori chose A,
the opposite of the two gentlemen.

1934
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:42,220
Will this decision make or break?

1935
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:45,130
Oh, nobody is here.

1936
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,090
Are you kidding me?

1937
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:51,800
- He didn't come.
- No!

1938
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,720
What?

1939
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,340
Oops.

1940
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:58,470
"Waiting room A"

1941
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:00,920
I didn't know the answer at all.

1942
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:04,090
I really have no idea.

1943
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:08,840
Is the painting group A or B?

1944
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:13,010
I'll tell you
the correct answer here.

1945
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:14,170
- Really?
- Yes.

1946
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,920
The correct answer of painting is...

1947
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,550
B.

1948
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:21,130
Yay!

1949
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:23,170
That means...

1950
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:24,760
What's he doing?

1951
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,050
Well...

1952
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:29,630
"A: Wrong"

1953
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:33,720
You can't tell paintings and photos
apart, you're in big trouble!

1954
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:38,590
They go one rank down
and fall to third-class celebrities.

1955
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:43,220
Did you know the correct answer?
The correct answer is B.

1956
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:51,170
The painter was Mr Takeshi Nagase,
who's said to give life to a canvas.

1957
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:53,260
"Acrylic paints, oil paints,
airbrushes are used"

1958
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:58,050
The artist pursues
extreme reality thoroughly.

1959
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,630
I thought group B
looked a bit three-dimensional.

1960
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:09,170
Katsumura got
his first correct answer today.

1961
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:14,550
Next, it's Team Gymnastics World
and Vanishing My First Love.

1962
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:17,920
They'll be lookalikes at once
if they get this wrong.

1963
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:20,210
"Shunsuke Michieda, Ren Meguro"

1964
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,210
Here they are!

1965
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:22,300
I'm counting on you!

1966
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,510
I can't say anything, though.

1967
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:25,470
True.

1968
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:26,420
Please!

1969
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:29,220
Their answers are...

1970
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,010
Ready, go.

1971
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,920
Good...

1972
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:37,760
My excellent juniors!

1973
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:39,510
Thank goodness!

1974
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,720
The third one, Mr Hamada, in B,

1975
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:47,590
if it's actually a photo,

1976
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:50,340
it looks very three-dimensional.

1977
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:51,340
Yeah.

1978
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:52,760
They're reliable!

1979
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,220
Brilliant. Good for you.

1980
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,380
Okay...

1981
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:58,260
They barely stay third-class.

1982
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,220
- They're here.
- They're here...

1983
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,300
- Come.
- Thank you.

1984
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:07,010
Thank you...

1985
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:08,800
We thought it would be B.

1986
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:13,010
Whoa... they all went there.

1987
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:14,420
"A: Wrong"

1988
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:17,630
Most of them will go to B!

1989
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:21,130
Katsunori is in A!

1990
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:27,970
Will anyone besides Katsunori
mix up paintings and photos?

1991
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:33,260
Next, it's second-class celebrity
DAIGO.

1992
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:36,210
Okay, DAIGO.

1993
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:37,970
He'll be fine.

1994
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:41,630
His answer is...

1995
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:44,470
B.

1996
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:46,550
Correct!

1997
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:48,800
It obviously is B!

1998
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,880
Yes, there's no way
you can get it wrong.

1999
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:58,090
- Here he is.
- Many people.

2000
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,970
We totally outnumbered the other.

2001
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:03,300
I did it...

2002
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:05,090
- I did it.
- We'll win.

2003
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:06,590
- Yeah.
- We did it.

2004
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,380
This is bad...

2005
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:13,550
See? Katsunori is gradually
getting disheartened.

2006
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:17,010
"Extremely worried"

2007
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:21,670
Next, it's ordinary celebrity
Kento Nagayama.

2008
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:23,510
Here he comes.

2009
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:27,090
Now we'll see what Kento chooses.

2010
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:30,340
Which one will you choose?

2011
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,670
This one. B.

2012
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,630
He got it right too.

2013
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,720
Thank goodness!

2014
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:40,170
Now we finally have to ask,
"What's the matter with Katsunori?"

2015
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,050
We'll all beat him up!

2016
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:44,670
Seriously!

2017
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:46,010
What?

2018
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,550
Now it's five versus one.

2019
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:51,800
Wow!

2020
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:53,090
Thank you.

2021
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:55,550
"B: Correct"

2022
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:57,470
Great.

2023
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:02,050
Everyone went to the other room...

2024
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,420
Why do you fist-bump?

2025
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:07,510
- Thank you.
- Why do you fist-bump?

2026
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:09,220
"A: Wrong, B: Correct"

2027
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:11,550
Okay, all of you go to B.

2028
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:14,970
Leave Katsunori on his own.

2029
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:23,260
Will Katsunori end up losing alone
and be humiliated?

2030
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,170
Lastly, it's the girls
of Sakurazaka46.

2031
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:29,130
"Sakurazaka46"

2032
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:30,920
- Here they are.
- Sakurazaka.

2033
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:34,220
- You can do it.
- We'll see where they go.

2034
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,420
Okay, which one?

2035
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,760
Ready, go.

2036
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:44,050
It's divided!

2037
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,970
It's divided, but...

2038
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:49,130
- I'll trust you.
- Let's go to B.

2039
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:51,510
We'll choose B.

2040
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,220
Okay, Katsunori is alone!

2041
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,670
Thank goodness!

2042
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,220
It's lonely.

2043
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:58,170
"Loses alone"

2044
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:01,550
Now Katsunori will surely lose
on his own.

2045
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:03,550
Excuse me.

2046
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,880
Wow!

2047
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,340
Maybe it's really good.

2048
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:10,920
- It's nearly perfect.
- Amazing.

2049
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:11,920
Yay!

2050
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:15,010
This is bad...

2051
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:18,170
It has to be us.

2052
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:21,210
- This is amazing.
- Yes, it is.

2053
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:22,880
He looks dejected.

2054
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:25,720
"Lost fighting spirit"

2055
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,220
- What are you doing, Katsunori?
- That reminds me.

2056
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:32,130
When he was in university,

2057
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:35,050
he had hit on my niece.

2058
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:36,130
Really?

2059
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:39,010
That has nothing to do with this.

2060
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:41,130
It's true, but I just remembered.

2061
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:43,300
When he was
at Aoyama Gakuin University.

2062
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,720
He's cheerful.

2063
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,340
Before he knew it...

2064
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:50,470
Big drama after this!

2065
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,510
The fateful announcement
of the result!

2066
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:58,970
Here I am!

2067
01:52:59,050 --> 01:53:03,090
"Celeb Master enters the room
of the correct answer"

2068
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:06,380
I'm going to open the door
of the correct answer's room.

2069
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,970
The correct answer is...

2070
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:11,920
"B: Correct"

2071
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:14,210
"A: Wrong"

2072
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:18,210
Idiot!

2073
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:28,130
Thank goodness.

2074
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:29,210
Yay!

2075
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,550
Idiot!

2076
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:36,010
Yay! Thank goodness!

2077
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:37,130
Thank goodness.

2078
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:38,130
Yay!

2079
01:53:42,010 --> 01:53:43,220
I'm so happy!

2080
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:47,300
It would've been cool
if he had won alone.

2081
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:52,840
"Loses alone"

2082
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:58,760
Okay, people who answered correctly
are back.

2083
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:01,170
Wonderful. Well done!

2084
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:03,970
Please come in!

2085
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,720
Brilliant.

2086
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:06,920
Brilliant!

2087
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:08,170
Wonderful.

2088
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:12,630
- Everybody got it right!
- Yes.

2089
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,590
Hey...

2090
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:17,010
Okay, the person who got it wrong
is here. Come in.

2091
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,170
It must feel lonely.

2092
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:20,840
"Entrance for wrong answer"

2093
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:22,170
His knees must hurt.

2094
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,010
- He's embarrassed.
- His knees must hurt.

2095
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:28,300
Katsunori.

2096
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:30,340
I'm so angry at myself!

2097
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:34,720
The third one on the left--

2098
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,210
Okay, then.

2099
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,130
Okay.

2100
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:41,380
With one question left,

2101
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:44,630
there are now four teams
of third-class celebrities.

2102
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:48,880
I have a strong feeling that many
will disappear at the end.

2103
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:52,210
Okay, let's do our final test.

2104
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:53,340
Yes!

2105
01:54:55,210 --> 01:54:58,050
Okay, out last test is this.

2106
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:01,340
Taste from three options.

2107
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:08,510
Autumn is a season of food, so
you'll eat three dishes, A, B and C.

2108
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,920
First, A is omelette-wrapped eel.

2109
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:16,510
It's minced eel wrapped in egg.

2110
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:18,130
And B.

2111
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:19,720
Scallop salad.

2112
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,340
It's scallop and daikon radish
mixed with mayonnaise.

2113
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:24,670
And C.

2114
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:30,050
Vinegared crab. It's crab
and cucumber mixed with vinegar.

2115
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:34,130
But only one of the three is real.

2116
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:35,090
Just one.

2117
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:38,090
In other words, the other two are

2118
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:41,380
the Imitation Series sold by
Kanetsu Delica Foods.

2119
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:46,050
To put it simply, imitation crabmeat
made with fish paste.

2120
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:50,800
Please choose the real one
among eel, scallop, and crab.

2121
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:51,970
That's right.

2122
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:57,550
Eat the crab, scallop, and eel
and just guess which one is real.

2123
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:59,550
It's a super lucky question.

2124
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:05,550
You can't mistake food made with
fish paste that's totally different

2125
01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:07,210
for the real thing, right?

2126
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:10,590
Because it's obvious
and you should know this,

2127
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:16,090
so no matter which wrong answer you
choose, you'll go down two ranks.

2128
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:19,220
That means third-class celebs
will disappear.

2129
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,170
Second-class will barely stay.

2130
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:23,800
Sorry, we do this every time,

2131
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,800
but if the ordinary celebrities
get the last one right,

2132
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,220
you're back to first-class.

2133
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,130
It's a chance to make a comeback.

2134
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:30,920
Yay...

2135
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:35,590
We do it every time. The others
will either disappear, or...

2136
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,800
Third-class will disappear
if you get it wrong.

2137
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:39,550
If we get it right?

2138
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:40,720
You stay third-class.

2139
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:42,760
- We won't go up?
- No.

2140
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:44,630
- We won't?
- Were you listening?

2141
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:48,130
The ordinary celebs will go up.

2142
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:50,920
- What about third-class?
- You stay the same.

2143
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:53,970
Maybe I'll punch you?

2144
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:56,170
You're scary.

2145
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:58,720
They are the representatives.

2146
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:01,050
Four teams are at the edge
of a cliff.

2147
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:05,510
You'll be shamed forever
if you disappear, so don't do it.

2148
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:06,970
Representatives, please come!

2149
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:08,510
Please come here.

2150
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,130
Will anyone make a comeback
to first-class?

2151
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,880
Do your best, Kiryuin.

2152
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:18,880
It sounds easy, but it's difficult.

2153
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:20,670
It looks difficult.

2154
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,210
- Okay, everyone.
- Yes.

2155
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:25,050
I'll tell you
the correct answer now.

2156
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,300
You'll see
whether they're correct or not.

2157
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:31,340
When they enter the Absolutely No
room, they'll vanish.

2158
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:35,470
Seriously?

2159
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:37,170
Okay, the correct answer is...

2160
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:39,380
C.

2161
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:43,880
So when they choose A or B,
third-class will vanish.

2162
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,260
Do your best.

2163
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:47,420
We want them to vanish
like "bon bon"!

2164
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:51,720
Most teams in the front row
are at risk.

2165
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,300
Here and there are at risk.

2166
01:57:55,130 --> 01:57:57,420
The third-class celebrities
are at risk.

2167
01:57:57,510 --> 01:58:01,010
If you don't choose the correct
answer, C, you'll vanish.

2168
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:02,010
Okay?

2169
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:05,840
The first one here is...

2170
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:08,210
The first one is...

2171
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:13,340
The third-class celebrity who'll
vanish if she's wrong, Mariko Kaga.

2172
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:14,470
Okay.

2173
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,170
Oh, no, even I am nervous.

2174
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:22,090
I'm not on her team,
but I'm nervous!

2175
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,970
It's over
if she chooses either A or B.

2176
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:26,210
- I see.
- Yes.

2177
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:30,170
They have to be blindfolded.

2178
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:32,260
- It feels so right.
- Is this okay?

2179
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:34,340
I can't see.

2180
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:35,880
It feels so right.

2181
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,470
How rude...

2182
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:46,380
First, the omelette-wrapped eel,
which is made with fish paste.

2183
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:47,630
Is it omelette-wrapped eel?

2184
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:50,300
"A: Absolutely No, Imitation Eel"

2185
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:51,220
Okay.

2186
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:53,090
She ate it rather quickly.

2187
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,550
- She didn't taste it.
- She didn't.

2188
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:59,880
Next, it's scallop,
which is also made with fish paste.

2189
01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:02,170
Her palate would be unsophisticated
if she chooses this,

2190
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:03,510
so she'd vanish.

2191
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:05,130
Okay.

2192
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:06,880
Ms Kaga is quick!

2193
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:08,090
It's quick.

2194
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,550
It looks like
she didn't taste it at all.

2195
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:11,800
Is this okay?

2196
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:15,090
She doesn't seem
to have tasted the food.

2197
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:16,970
Next, it's the correct answer, C.

2198
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:19,470
She only needs to choose this.

2199
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:23,470
"C: Correct. Real crab"

2200
01:59:23,550 --> 01:59:25,800
- It's taken her the longest to eat.
- Yes.

2201
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:28,510
Which one will she choose?

2202
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:32,210
Not anything besides C.

2203
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:34,720
Yes. She'll vanish the moment
she raises the card of A or B.

2204
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:39,550
Will the great actress choose C,
the correct answer?

2205
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:41,260
It's difficult.

2206
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:42,220
Oh?

2207
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,590
It's difficult, but it's C.

2208
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:50,800
But B was made too well.

2209
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:52,760
The scallop?

2210
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:54,130
Yes.

2211
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:56,340
It was made too well.

2212
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:59,380
It's difficult. I'll choose C again.

2213
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,300
Wow!

2214
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:04,420
Wonderful! Impressive, Ms Kaga.

2215
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:06,630
We don't have to vanish.

2216
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,760
Wow!

2217
02:00:09,130 --> 02:00:12,840
I sensed a bit of shell in it.

2218
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,010
No way.

2219
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:15,550
So it's...

2220
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,670
Maybe it's real crab.

2221
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:20,260
It's impressive
if that's how far you go to do this.

2222
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:21,300
Wow!

2223
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,470
Wow, impressive!

2224
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:23,550
Brilliant.

2225
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:25,760
Wow, amazing!

2226
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,590
Now you're safe.

2227
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:29,970
She said that,
but was there really shell in it?

2228
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:32,590
- I don't think so...
- No.

2229
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:33,510
No, right?

2230
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:37,880
She either got it wrong,
or someone hates Ms Kaga.

2231
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:39,970
Hard bits...

2232
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:43,550
It's difficult to walk in these.

2233
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:46,210
- Okay.
- Mariko Kaga barely survived!

2234
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,800
She stays put
as a third-class celebrity.

2235
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:52,050
The next one is...

2236
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:53,800
Thank you...

2237
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:55,630
"Third-class celebrity
Ryoko Yonekura"

2238
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,880
This third-class celebrity
is also at the edge of a cliff.

2239
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:00,380
It's Ryoko Yonekura.

2240
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:01,720
Okay!

2241
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:05,380
Let's see whether Kacchan
will vanish or not.

2242
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:06,550
Oh?

2243
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:08,220
"Might vanish"

2244
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:11,510
What's this? I really can't see.

2245
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:13,210
It suits her.

2246
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:18,880
The lady who never fails naturally
knows which one is real.

2247
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:21,760
First, the fish paste that'll make
her vanish if she chooses it.

2248
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,880
"A: Imitation eel"

2249
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:27,050
She loves eel, so I'm sure
she won't choose the first one.

2250
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:28,050
I see.

2251
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:30,880
Next, B.

2252
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:34,220
It's fake scallop. She'll also
vanish if she chooses this.

2253
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:39,420
"B: Imitation scallop"

2254
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:45,880
And C. Will the great actress choose
the correct answer and not vanish?

2255
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:47,470
"C: Real crab"

2256
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:50,300
I hope Ryoko will come here.

2257
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:51,800
"C: Correct"

2258
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:55,800
It looks difficult.

2259
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,010
She can't decide.

2260
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:58,420
Good.

2261
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:00,090
Okay, choose.

2262
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:01,970
I have no clue at all.

2263
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,220
She'll vanish the moment
she holds up A or B.

2264
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:12,130
What's the answer of Michiko Daimon,
the lady who never fails?

2265
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:21,300
"B: Imitation scallop"

2266
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,510
Yes!

2267
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:24,920
Yes!

2268
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:26,300
Not yet!

2269
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:28,590
Are you kidding me?

2270
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:30,630
Surprisingly, now...

2271
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:33,840
"C: Real crab"

2272
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,970
Can she answer correctly?

2273
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,840
That was close!

2274
02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:39,630
Half of me disappeared.

2275
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:44,920
Her fateful decision is...

2276
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:48,300
- No!
- Yes!

2277
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:52,590
She vanished after all.

2278
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:54,510
Okay, she vanished!

2279
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:57,510
"Not worth showing"

2280
02:02:57,970 --> 02:02:59,340
Thank you.

2281
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:03,340
Only his voice.
We only hear his voice.

2282
02:03:03,550 --> 02:03:08,630
Either the fibres are well made,
so I feel that it's scallop,

2283
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:12,470
but I can't tell
if it's a real scallop.

2284
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:15,670
She failed!

2285
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,090
Michiko Daimon failed!

2286
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:19,800
I thought she never failed.

2287
02:03:21,510 --> 02:03:25,720
I'm afraid the lady who never fails
has made a huge mistake,

2288
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:31,630
so Hollywood Zakoshisyoh X
will perform exaggeratedly for her.

2289
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:33,340
"Yonekura"

2290
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:37,470
"B: Absolutely No"

2291
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:40,010
It was C...

2292
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:43,050
I couldn't decide...

2293
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,720
between B and C...

2294
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:48,380
"Yonekura"

2295
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:50,590
It's C after all?

2296
02:03:52,130 --> 02:03:53,800
Yes, it's C.

2297
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:57,340
The next one is also...

2298
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:00,550
Okay.

2299
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:02,840
From the Johnny's
at the edge of a cliff,

2300
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:05,550
Yuri Chinen, who answered
all the questions wrong today.

2301
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,130
He'll decide our fate.

2302
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:12,800
First, it's A.
Eel made with fish paste.

2303
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,880
You can't get it wrong, can you?

2304
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:18,050
It's delicious?

2305
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:22,510
Next, B. He'll also vanish
if he chooses this.

2306
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:24,090
"B: Imitation scallop"

2307
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:27,220
Okay, Meguro, Michieda,
get ready to vanish.

2308
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,630
Wait, no...

2309
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,590
- Please let us pray.
- Please.

2310
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:34,970
As the senior, will he be able
to show his pride at the end?

2311
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:36,840
This is real crab.

2312
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:38,590
What will he choose?

2313
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:44,340
I think it isn't A.

2314
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:47,010
Good, choose B, then.

2315
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,510
Which one?

2316
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,920
- Man up and choose B.
- Which one?

2317
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:52,380
Choose B.

2318
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:54,470
"Vanish if it's A or B"

2319
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:57,210
- His answer is...
- Okay.

2320
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:58,420
I think...

2321
02:05:00,170 --> 02:05:01,130
it's B.

2322
02:05:01,210 --> 02:05:05,630
"B: Imitation scallop"

2323
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:06,920
Yes!

2324
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:09,050
Okay, he vanished!

2325
02:05:10,210 --> 02:05:13,220
Goodbye, Mr Michieda, Mr Meguro.

2326
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,210
People keep vanishing!

2327
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:16,300
Are you kidding me?

2328
02:05:16,510 --> 02:05:21,170
I think I felt the fibres of scallop
in the texture.

2329
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,510
Good! Chinen, good!

2330
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:25,420
Yes!

2331
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:26,970
Hey...

2332
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:32,300
Two people in a row!

2333
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:35,050
There are more and more Zakoshi!

2334
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:37,720
"Yonekura"

2335
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,260
Thank goodness!

2336
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:42,720
But... I'm not confident at all.

2337
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,970
I had no idea either.

2338
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:45,590
It's B?

2339
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:48,090
"C: Correct"

2340
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:51,340
The other group
is also at the edge of a cliff.

2341
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:56,380
Third-class celebrity Masaaki Sakai
might vanish miserably.

2342
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:59,550
"Masaaki Sakai"

2343
02:05:59,630 --> 02:06:01,130
Hey, Monkey Magic.

2344
02:06:03,130 --> 02:06:06,210
Please don't vanish
three teams in a row.

2345
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:08,800
Which one? Will he guess it right?

2346
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,800
Wow...

2347
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:14,550
First, the fake eel that'll make him
vanish at once if he chooses it.

2348
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:17,170
"A: Imitation eel"

2349
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:18,510
He's going to say, "Delicious!"

2350
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:22,300
Delicious.

2351
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,630
"Delicious..."

2352
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,340
See? He said it.

2353
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:28,300
- He did.
- He said delicious.

2354
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:31,920
Oh, no, Masaaki might be in trouble.

2355
02:06:32,050 --> 02:06:35,170
Next, B is also
the Absolutely No fish paste.

2356
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:38,880
"B: Imitation scallop"

2357
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:43,720
And the real one, C. You'll vanish
if you don't choose this.

2358
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:47,260
"C: Real crab"

2359
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:50,420
Will he be able to stay
without vanishing?

2360
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:54,590
- What will he choose?
- Okay...

2361
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,800
What's that? Really...

2362
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,970
Go on. Choose A.

2363
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:01,420
I'll say it.

2364
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,380
His answer is...

2365
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:07,760
Yes!

2366
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:11,470
"B: Imitation scallop"

2367
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:12,800
Okay, he vanished!

2368
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:17,510
Now three teams have disappeared.

2369
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,510
Goodbye.

2370
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,720
K Dash...

2371
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:24,760
The scallop of B tasted

2372
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:28,720
most like scallop salad--

2373
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,550
Yes! Monkey Magic!

2374
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,050
He is finally back!

2375
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:36,420
"Monkey Magic, GODAIGO"

2376
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:42,260
The Son Goku who swept the world
has made an unexpected comeback!

2377
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:49,340
"Sakai"

2378
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:52,510
"Chinen, Yonekura"

2379
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:54,720
Okay...

2380
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,630
- Thank goodness...
- Did you wait for me?

2381
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:00,050
We've been waiting for you.

2382
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,300
She's sure.

2383
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:04,170
She's happy and is sure she's right.

2384
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:05,590
She definitely thinks that.

2385
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,090
- A was wrong.
- Yeah.

2386
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:15,510
But what was left in my mouth
after I ate C

2387
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:17,720
was different from crab.

2388
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:20,090
- There wasn't any crab fibre.
- No.

2389
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:21,220
Not at all.

2390
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:24,050
If you think about it,
Ms Kaga is amazing.

2391
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:25,920
She is, but she looks lonely
being on her own.

2392
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:32,880
Next, it's Sho Kiryuin, who wants
to stay in second-class desperately.

2393
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:37,550
I'm counting on you.
I'm happy with being second-class.

2394
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:39,800
- Right?
- Yeah, it's enough.

2395
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:44,380
First, it's A. If he chooses this,
they'll be lookalikes.

2396
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:48,220
"A: Imitation eel"

2397
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:52,340
Next, the fish paste of B.
Don't choose this either.

2398
02:08:52,420 --> 02:08:56,800
"B: Imitation scallop"

2399
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,050
And now...

2400
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:04,630
What happened?

2401
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:05,920
Are you okay?

2402
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:08,420
- What's the matter?
- Is he okay?

2403
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:09,800
What was that?

2404
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,510
I wonder what happened.

2405
02:09:13,130 --> 02:09:17,260
Kiryuin is acting strange.
This is the correct answer.

2406
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:18,920
"C: Real crab"

2407
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:19,970
I'm counting on you.

2408
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:27,220
- What's the matter?
- You okay?

2409
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:30,130
I don't know.

2410
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:33,050
- He seems to be looking for crab.
- Yeah.

2411
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:34,470
He's looking for it.

2412
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:37,010
What will he hold up?

2413
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:38,590
Stay the same?

2414
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:40,050
Or lookalikes?

2415
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:41,340
"Lookalike if A or B"

2416
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:44,260
Will he be able to choose C?

2417
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,210
The real one is...

2418
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,800
- A.
- Wait!

2419
02:09:54,010 --> 02:09:55,130
Are you kidding me?

2420
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:56,720
That's unexpected.

2421
02:09:57,050 --> 02:09:58,670
It's the first A we've got.

2422
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:03,380
"Chinen, Yonekura, Sakai"

2423
02:10:03,510 --> 02:10:05,920
- It's divided.
- It's divided now.

2424
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:10,130
It didn't taste like
what eel is supposed to taste...

2425
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:14,090
was cultured and injected in.

2426
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:16,010
Of course,
it's the Imitation Series.

2427
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:19,800
That's how natural food tastes.

2428
02:10:19,970 --> 02:10:21,920
Okay, I see.

2429
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:24,010
You go two ranks down

2430
02:10:24,090 --> 02:10:27,220
from second-class celebrities
to lookalikes.

2431
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:32,130
So the Kiryuin lookalike
goes to an empty Room A.

2432
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:35,420
What?

2433
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:41,050
It's an empty room!

2434
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:42,880
"Chinen, Yonekura, Sakai"

2435
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:44,970
His voice just now was incredible.

2436
02:10:47,170 --> 02:10:49,210
Many people chose B.

2437
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:54,920
I can't turn Mr DAIGO
into a lookalike.

2438
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:57,670
He already is.

2439
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:59,010
No...

2440
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:00,670
This is tough too.

2441
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:02,880
It can't be helped.

2442
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:05,550
Mr Umemiya and Mr Matsukata
both wore them!

2443
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:07,590
The traditional...

2444
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:08,920
It's extraordinary if you think so.

2445
02:11:09,010 --> 02:11:10,510
Yes!

2446
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:14,170
- I must wear it, then.
- Yes.

2447
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:15,920
Whoa...

2448
02:11:16,630 --> 02:11:20,380
Next, ordinary celebrity
who might come back to first-class,

2449
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:22,050
Nanase Nishino.

2450
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:23,800
"Nanase Nishino"

2451
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:27,220
Now we'll see whether you can go
back to first-class or not.

2452
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:28,550
"Back to first-class if correct"

2453
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:29,760
She can do it.

2454
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:30,840
- Really?
- Yes.

2455
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:34,260
First, it's A,
which will bring her two ranks down.

2456
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:35,800
"A: Imitation eel"

2457
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:38,090
Can she tell?

2458
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:43,220
Next, B, also a wrong answer.

2459
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:46,220
"B: Imitation scallop"

2460
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:47,550
You can do it.

2461
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:50,800
B is good. There are many people.

2462
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,210
"Chinen, Yonekura, Sakai"

2463
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:57,970
And C, the correct answer that
only Mariko Kaga has chosen so far.

2464
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:02,470
"Getting tired"

2465
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:05,130
- Wow...
- Ms Kaga made herself at home!

2466
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:10,090
Her back...
She's sitting on her back.

2467
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:14,590
She'll be first-class
if she says C now.

2468
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,630
Yes.

2469
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:16,920
"First-class if C"

2470
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:19,340
Her answer is...

2471
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:23,880
It's A.

2472
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:29,880
"Two ranks down"

2473
02:12:29,970 --> 02:12:31,380
- Really?
- What?

2474
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:33,510
What?

2475
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:34,510
No way!

2476
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:37,340
"Chinen, Yonekura, Sakai"

2477
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:43,220
I'm sure B was wrong.

2478
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:50,090
I also thought C was too chewy,
and it didn't feel right.

2479
02:12:51,090 --> 02:12:53,760
- Kento...
- It's by elimination.

2480
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:57,510
A felt most real...

2481
02:12:58,510 --> 02:13:01,220
I don't think it was the eel,
though.

2482
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:04,920
The eel was the one that somehow...

2483
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:09,800
What a shame!
She fell to a third-class celebrity!

2484
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:11,840
"Third-class celebrity"

2485
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:14,510
Mr Kiryuin!

2486
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:19,090
I was rather sure...
Well, it was by elimination.

2487
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,170
It's A.

2488
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:24,210
Lastly, the three ladies
who will come back as first-class

2489
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:25,590
if they get it right.

2490
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:27,840
"Borujuku"

2491
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:29,170
Here they are.

2492
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:31,920
- You can do it.
- They look powerful!

2493
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:35,220
They're masters!

2494
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,970
Wear your eye masks!

2495
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,380
- Wear your eye masks!
- They're wearing them.

2496
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:45,380
- Anri isn't wearing hers!
- She is.

2497
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,010
- She is?
- She is.

2498
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:48,300
Yeah?

2499
02:13:49,170 --> 02:13:50,470
They open their mouths so quickly.

2500
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:54,010
First, it's A.

2501
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,470
She keeps her mouth open.

2502
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:06,300
You won't choose the fish paste
that isn't eel, right?

2503
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:10,760
Wait, what she said at the opening
might turn out to be true.

2504
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:11,970
Indeed.

2505
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:15,170
"Only we'll stay first-class."

2506
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:21,220
Next, it's B. They also can't return
to first-class if they choose this.

2507
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:24,420
"B: Imitation scallop"

2508
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:27,630
- Really, what will happen?
- No idea.

2509
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:31,800
And this is C, the correct answer.

2510
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:35,220
I like this scene most.

2511
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:38,260
- I like Anri's face.
- It's the best.

2512
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:42,630
Their ranking will go up
to first-class if they choose this.

2513
02:14:44,470 --> 02:14:46,720
- Will they be first-class
- It's hard to tell.

2514
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,210
or third-class?

2515
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:49,380
I want to go back!

2516
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,210
Ready, go.

2517
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,340
What will happen?

2518
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:57,130
Wow!

2519
02:14:58,130 --> 02:15:00,050
What are their answers?

2520
02:15:01,130 --> 02:15:02,720
- Have you decided?
- Yes.

2521
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:04,720
Ready, go.

2522
02:15:06,550 --> 02:15:09,470
- It's divided!
- It's divided!

2523
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:13,220
Wow!

2524
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:15,590
This is amazing!

2525
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:20,220
Oops...

2526
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:25,420
"C: Correct"

2527
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:28,590
The tinned crab lately is amazing.

2528
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:30,920
No, Tanabe, shut up!

2529
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:33,340
I thought for a moment it was C.

2530
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:36,380
I really couldn't decide,
buy the more I chewed,

2531
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:39,170
the richer the flavour became.

2532
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:40,880
That's right. Tell her, Anri.

2533
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,920
When I ate B, the scallop,

2534
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:51,760
I thought the texture was like
the scallop sold at corner shops,

2535
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,220
and I could taste the crabmeat in C.

2536
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:56,800
Amazing...

2537
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,090
They'll go with it, right?

2538
02:15:58,170 --> 02:15:59,550
They'll choose C.

2539
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:02,130
Yes, but the flavour exploded
when I first tried it.

2540
02:16:02,210 --> 02:16:03,510
That's enough, Tanabe!

2541
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:05,550
Wow...

2542
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:07,300
What will you choose?

2543
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:09,470
Ms Tanabe knows food better.

2544
02:16:09,550 --> 02:16:14,170
I was confused just now.
If I trust my instincts, it's C.

2545
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:15,260
- You sure?
- Yeah.

2546
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:17,050
- Really.
- Please say it, then.

2547
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:19,050
- We choose C.
- C.

2548
02:16:20,170 --> 02:16:22,380
First-class celebrities!

2549
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:24,800
- Wow!
- Yay!

2550
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,550
You made a comeback!

2551
02:16:26,670 --> 02:16:27,880
Brilliant!

2552
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:29,130
Well done!

2553
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:30,090
Wow!

2554
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:31,760
They chose C.

2555
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,550
"Chinen, Yonekura, Sakai"

2556
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:34,880
It's divided.

2557
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:41,210
Well done! They made a comeback
and are the only first-class celebs!

2558
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:42,170
Let's go.

2559
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:43,170
"The only first-class"

2560
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:44,970
Welcome, ladies.

2561
02:16:45,050 --> 02:16:47,510
- Wow!
- It's Ms Kaga!

2562
02:16:47,630 --> 02:16:48,510
She's happy.

2563
02:16:48,590 --> 02:16:49,630
Ms Kaga looks happy.

2564
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,090
She is happy.

2565
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:53,470
- We are divided.
- Equally!

2566
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:55,840
- It's divided equally.
- It is.

2567
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:58,130
What's going to happen?

2568
02:16:58,210 --> 02:17:00,800
I've been choosing B
and got them all wrong.

2569
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,380
You chose B every time?

2570
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:04,340
I came here every time.

2571
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:07,010
- How many did you guess right?
- Not one.

2572
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:14,010
The fateful announcement
of the result!

2573
02:17:15,130 --> 02:17:17,210
Am I going to vanish?

2574
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:21,380
They've already vanished
and have become Zakoshi and monkey,

2575
02:17:21,470 --> 02:17:25,010
but please enjoy
their own anxious faces.

2576
02:17:26,630 --> 02:17:28,630
Here I am!

2577
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,840
"Celeb Master goes to
the room of the correct answer"

2578
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:32,260
- Come!
- Please come.

2579
02:17:32,670 --> 02:17:33,670
Please!

2580
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:39,670
I'm going to open the room
of the correct answer.

2581
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:42,010
"C: Correct"

2582
02:17:42,090 --> 02:17:44,420
"A: Absolutely No"

2583
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:47,920
"B: Absolutely No"

2584
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:49,800
The room I open
is the correct answer's.

2585
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:53,260
The others
will either vanish or stay.

2586
02:17:53,550 --> 02:17:55,470
It's possible
that we've already vanished?

2587
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:57,050
We aren't shown anymore?

2588
02:17:58,050 --> 02:18:01,010
Let's do it.
The correct answer is...

2589
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:10,920
No...

2590
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:13,340
Wrong... Oh, no...

2591
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:15,510
I'm scared!

2592
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:16,510
What?

2593
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:18,210
What...

2594
02:18:22,380 --> 02:18:23,510
Congratulations!

2595
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:28,220
Yay! Yay!

2596
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:29,800
I knew it.

2597
02:18:30,630 --> 02:18:32,210
Congratulations!

2598
02:18:33,170 --> 02:18:34,920
Yay...

2599
02:18:35,550 --> 02:18:36,550
Yay!

2600
02:18:42,510 --> 02:18:44,630
Really?

2601
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:48,630
I've had enough...

2602
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,720
We've already vanished!

2603
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:52,920
The whole time we've been here.

2604
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:53,840
We've vanished?

2605
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,970
We've vanished.

2606
02:18:55,050 --> 02:18:56,210
Why have we vanished?

2607
02:18:56,470 --> 02:18:57,970
Because we got it wrong.

2608
02:18:58,470 --> 02:18:59,630
Yay!

2609
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:01,470
You're back to first-class.

2610
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:03,260
- Yay!
- It's amazing!

2611
02:19:03,630 --> 02:19:06,880
We must know our food.

2612
02:19:07,010 --> 02:19:10,170
You looked like you were in
your home's living room halfway.

2613
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:13,590
Yes? Oh, right, you could see.

2614
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,340
Those in B are already gone.

2615
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,800
Oh, no...

2616
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:18,170
We disappeared?

2617
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:22,670
Yes. We've completely disappeared.

2618
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:25,760
What the heck? It's pathetic.

2619
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:32,470
It's dramatic! Three teams vanished!
Only one is back to first-class!

2620
02:19:33,130 --> 02:19:36,220
We have done all the tests.

2621
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:38,010
Let's check.

2622
02:19:38,470 --> 02:19:42,260
There is one team
of first-class celebrities!

2623
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:44,720
Brilliant! Well done!

2624
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:46,760
I'm so happy.

2625
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:50,720
Next, two teams
of third-class celebrities.

2626
02:19:51,670 --> 02:19:55,420
- And one team of lookalikes.
- Hello.

2627
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:57,420
We had more teams, right?

2628
02:19:58,170 --> 02:20:00,550
Yes, we did. What happened?

2629
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:03,170
You disappeared again.

2630
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:05,170
Oops...

2631
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:06,720
What's this?

2632
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:07,880
Hmm...

2633
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:09,210
It's Kacchan's fault?

2634
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:11,590
I think it isn't that different.

2635
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:15,010
- The one who mustn't fail failed.
- Yeah.

2636
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:17,550
Indeed. And it's Chinen's fault
for your team.

2637
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:19,010
Yes, I'm sorry!

2638
02:20:19,090 --> 02:20:20,130
It's Chinen's fault.

2639
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:22,420
- And you two are both rubbish.
- What?

2640
02:20:24,130 --> 02:20:25,420
- What rubbish?
- Gosh...

2641
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:26,840
Here I am.

2642
02:20:29,050 --> 02:20:31,050
Why don't you touch me?

2643
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:36,510
Masaaki was a nice man.

2644
02:20:40,210 --> 02:20:43,800
We don't want to see Hama-chan's
Zakoshi after the mini test.

2645
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:45,550
First, matsutake mushroom.

2646
02:20:48,210 --> 02:20:49,300
Their answers are...

2647
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:55,050
The correct answer is...

2648
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:57,670
Yes! Yes!

2649
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,970
I can do it.

2650
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:00,380
Cello.

2651
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:03,130
- That was easy.
- Yes?

2652
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:04,420
The correct answer is...

2653
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:05,590
What?

2654
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:10,590
- It was easy, though...
- It was...

2655
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:12,220
Jazz.

2656
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:15,050
Oh... I judged based on the trumpet.

2657
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:18,340
Oh, the trumpet.
I didn't listen to the trumpet.

2658
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:19,800
The correct answer is...

2659
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:24,800
- It was the trumpet.
- Right?

2660
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:29,010
Will he vanish as usual?
Taiko drums!

2661
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:30,720
The correct answer is...

2662
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:31,720
Yes!

2663
02:21:36,130 --> 02:21:36,970
Painting.

2664
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:38,630
The correct answer is...

2665
02:21:38,970 --> 02:21:39,800
Good.

2666
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:46,920
Lastly, it's food. Can he guess
correctly and stay second-class?

2667
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:49,130
- Okay.
- Their answers are...

2668
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:55,880
He chose the fishcake
and ended up being a lookalike.

2669
02:21:55,970 --> 02:21:58,630
Try to make it
on the New Year show next time.
