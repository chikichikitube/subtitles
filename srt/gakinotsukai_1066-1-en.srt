1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,200
Gaki no Tsukai's famous series: Shichi-Henge

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,500
In this series we get to see how a true comedian behaves

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,810
In a harsh situation in which they can't fail

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,180
And today's challenger is...

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,910
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,250
Morisanchu's Kurosawa Shichi-Henge!

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,190
Not many women charenge this.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,030
Tomochika did it the other day,

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,730
but other than that, only Oba-chan has done this.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,500
So this is the first female challenger in a long time.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,240
- She is the 35th person to challenge.
- The 35th challenger.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,340
- I wonder what will happen. I bet she didn't think she would experience this before sex either.
- What are you saying?

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,350
Today's star, please come on in.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,490
- You guys are still looking great grade out there.
- All three of you are very good.

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,860
- Very good.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,030
You can tell him if you don't like it.

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,130
He does it for no reason.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Here is the ranking list.
What rank are you aiming for?

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,840
Who do you want to win against?

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,080
But....But.....

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,640
- Answer quickly.
- Yes.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,680
If you don't answer quickly, she will be harmed.

23
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,920
Tat's about enough.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,950
Answer quickly.

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,720
- Answer quickly.
- That sounded good.

26
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,110
You should be sued.

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,180
What is that?

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,220
"Heipo invented project: I want to squeeze Nadeshiko Japan's tits."

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,550
She's good during the game, don't you think?

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,750
Eh!?

31
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,720
Who are you talking about?

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,720
Sawa is good.

33
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not a matter of good or bad.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
That kind of teasing can get you in trouble.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,340
And the word "teasing" isn't a good one either.

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,640
This whole part will not be aired.

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,110
Then stop writing these things.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,910
I think there are too many planning ideas.

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,750
"Let's raise Matsumoto's daughter to be a comedian."

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,490
- She has inherited your DNA.
- The public is expecting this.

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,530
She's only one year and nine months old.

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,660
In other words, let's give her a gifted education.

43
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,560
If I were to put her in an office somewhere, I would put her in Jinrikisha.

44
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,870
I will not put her in Yoshimoto Kogyo.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,230
Why not Yoshimoto?

46
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,940
Is it a problem with the ratio of remuneration?

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,740
Her father suffered from that ratio.

48
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,140
I want to do this!

49
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,710
"What if we lock Tanaka in a box?"

50
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,820
I can never do that.

51
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,150
Why?

52
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,250
I would absolutely freak out.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,790
I would not be able to breathe properly.

54
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,090
- So much so that you wouldn't be able to air it?
- Yes, this would be unbroadcastable on TV.

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,990
Have you ever been through this?

56
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:26,530
In another show I was once trapped in a box and driven about 10 km.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,110
At that time, I was so scared, to the point that it probably shouldn't have been broadcasted.

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,740
I thought the only thing waiting for me ahead was death.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,450
It was so dangerous that I knew it myself.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,750
But still, how long does she keep us waiting when it's the first one?

61
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,160
- I'm sure she's trying to time it right.
- No way.

62
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,470
- But we have to have a planning meeting.
- Yes.

63
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,000
What took her so long to change into that thing?

64
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,450
She's got a loud voice.

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,150
She certainly had a loud voice.

66
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,130
When I saw her profile as she entered this room, she looked like Football Hour's Goto's mom.

67
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,580
Excuse me.

68
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,090
Am I allowed to speak?

69
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,860
Excuse me.

70
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,820
Hey, that's mine!

71
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
That's my autograph!

72
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,390
You're good!

73
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,460
What the hell are you doing!?

74
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,210
That's not fair!

75
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,780
That's not fair!

76
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,220
Stop it!

77
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,290
What the hell are you doing?

78
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,760
That's enough!

79
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Where did you get that?

80
00:07:51,400 --> 00:08:12,750
Welcome Downtown

81
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,820
Matsumoto: Thank you for your kindness.

82
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,160
Where did you get that from?

83
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,930
Hamada: Can I love you?

84
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,470
Matsumoto: I came to see you because I love you.

85
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,770
She's disgusting.

86
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,910
Hamada: I love your eyes.

87
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:50,590
Matsumoto & Hamada:
I can tell how I feel when I see you.
So now we're in the same youth.

88
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,660
- Thatâ€™s too long.
- This is nostalgic.

89
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,100
What the hell.

90
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,510
Those were from when you were in the Nichoume Theater.

91
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,680
- Are those her personal items?
- Yes.

92
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,820
- She was corresponding with about 30 Downtown fans at the time.
- Really?

93
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,550
- She did that with the other fans?
- Yes.

94
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,690
I think that's probably when she was able to write those autograph.

95
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,100
I'm left-handed, but she wrote that one right-handed.

96
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,570
She once wrote her name as "Matsumoto Hitoshi" on a test answer sheet and got a zero.

97
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,240
Is it serious!?

98
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,310
She's a strange one.

99
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,280
I'm a pervert, right?

100
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,810
I know you're in trouble.

101
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,550
I know you're in trouble.

102
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,380
No...

103
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,720
Use this.

104
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,440
She's crazy.

105
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,910
What did she say to you?

106
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,640
She said to me, "I know you're in trouble."

107
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,410
So I told her "No", and she said, "Use this."

108
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,280
She wanted to be in the mirror with this, didn't she?

109
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,890
I don't understand the story.

110
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,590
She said, "I'm a pervert, right?"

111
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,290
She said that?

112
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,780
You're all grownups, right?

113
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,880
I rub against your body, Go.

114
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,120
I forgot something important, so I'll be back.

115
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,970
I brought a rope.

116
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:01,080
I brought a rope.
I would like to play a game with everyone now.

117
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,250
Let's call it the "Rope Game."

118
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,320
Let's start the rope game.

119
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,190
Look, there is a rope.
Here, Hamachan, hold the rope.

120
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,000
Hold, Hold, Hold the rope.

121
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,340
A nice woman passes in front of the grownups.

122
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,280
Hold, Hold, Hold the rope.
Hold, Hold, Hold the rope.

123
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,850
Lift it once.
Lift it once.
Let's find out your limits.

124
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,150
I'll step over here.

125
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,520
Omatagi-san, Omatagi-san.
I'll step from here to here.

126
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,460
Then I'll step over here now.

127
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,300
A nice woman steps over here.
Oh, wait a moment.

128
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,640
I raaaaaaaaaaaise my leg!

129
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,020
- Omatagi-san, Omatagi-san.
Omatagi-san will follow a rope.
- She is an idiot.

130
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,050
I will follow a rope.

131
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,690
Here we go

132
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,360
Lift the rope once.

133
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,860
Lift the rope once.
Lift the rope once.
Lift the rope ooooooonce.

134
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,130
Lift the rope oooooonce.

135
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:38,170
Lift, Lift, Lift, Lift, Lift, Lift, Lift,
Lift the rope oooooonce.

136
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,240
She is an idiot.

137
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,450
Omatagi-san's rope.

138
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,120
Lift, Lift,
Lift the rope oooooonce.

139
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,660
If you Lift the rope too much, it will hurt, so please lower it.

140
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,160
Lower this. Lower this. Lower this.

141
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,730
If you lower this, Omatagi-san won't have anything to step over.

142
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:16,580
Come on, in that case, let's all work together to hold the rooooooooope!

143
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
Omatagi-san!

144
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,690
Hold, Hold, Hold,
Hold the rope.

145
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,030
Give Omatagi-san's Mata(crotch) to you.

146
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,570
He was an adult male.

147
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,900
I have nothing to give you.

148
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:54,080
I'll give that rope to you guys and you can play with it later.

149
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,850
She is just plain stupid.

150
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,490
- It was vulgar.
- Yeah.

151
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,560
What's "Omatagi-san"?

152
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,140
It's Kasumi.

153
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,980
It's Kasumi Aizawa.

154
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:32,250
Thank you all for gathering here for me today!

155
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:41,730
Today I would like to sing a song in front of you all!
Do you all know my song?

156
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:49,640
Dad, Mom, Grandpa, and Sister.

157
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:56,880
Today we all made a big hand-rolled sushi.

158
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,750
When I ate it, everything came out of my ass.

159
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:08,890
Dad, Mom, Gather all my relatives.

160
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,590
Thank you for listening to my song.

161
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,570
Well, I don't know what to do.

162
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,670
I am scared of her.

163
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,570
I don't know what to do.
Look, my hands are redder than I thought.

164
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,610
Okay, I'm going to go sing a song.

165
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,420
It was Kasumi.

166
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,920
She is wayward.

167
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,330
I was scared when she was banging on the wall.

168
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,830
Someone like that came to my house once.

169
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,800
Kasumi-chan?

170
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,370
The police told me, "Just shake her hand."

171
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,640
That's a calm response.

172
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,680
Is that what the responding police told you?

173
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,450
He said, "If you shake her hand, she won't come here anymore."

174
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,580
So I just shook her hand.

175
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,720
She was like a Kasumi-chan.

176
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,600
- She likes this kind of thing.
- Yeah.

177
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,690
You're reckless!

178
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,670
What should I do?

179
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,740
Your head accessory is coming out.

180
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,410
What should I do?

181
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,720
You're not wearing that?

182
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,630
What are you going to do?

183
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,440
What are you doing?!

184
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,470
Why don't you dip it in soy sauce?

185
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,030
She always adds something at the end, doesn't she?

186
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,330
Why did she eat sushi?

187
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,770
This board hit my head as hard as it could.

188
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,910
Even if it was your bad luck, I didn't think it would happen.

189
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:53,950
- She likes to dance and sing.
- Yeah.

190
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm beat.
Guess what.

191
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,630
Please listen to my story about my son.

192
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,900
You know, my son is in a rebellious phase.

193
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:24,280
He doesn't listen to me at all.
I wasn't there for him when he needed me the most.
Oh, I have a headache.

194
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:39,860
During such an important time of his life,
So I can't blame him.

195
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:48,240
My daughter says she's never had a home-cooked meal from you.
You have a daughter, too, don't you?

196
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:59,350
Your daughter is at a important time, but it's good that her mother is home.
You have a daughter too?

197
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:11,830
It's not just a lonely mistake.

198
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:22,370
With you, I could dream it.

199
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,010
It's dirty!

200
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,550
Dirty!

201
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,790
Dirty!

202
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,130
So I would like to get to know my son and daughter from now on.

203
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:04,210
I would like to share the information I got from you guys today with my son and daughter.

204
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,490
The content has nothing to do with that ass at all.
She just wanted to show her ass.

205
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,160
55 thousand?! That's second place!

206
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,570
You are in second place.

207
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,970
- You beat Bob Sapp.
- Thank you very much!

208
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,810
That last one is not good.

209
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,680
That's the kind of dirty ass you can only see at a beach with no name.

210
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,820
That's the kind of ass you can only see in places where swimming is forbidden.

211
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,820
Originally, that could only be seen in places where swimming was prohibited.
